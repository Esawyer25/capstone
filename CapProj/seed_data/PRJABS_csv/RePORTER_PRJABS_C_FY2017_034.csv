"9326774","SUMMARY  Cell motility and contractility depend on tightly controlled assembly of the actin cytoskeleton. Formins are a major group of actin assembly proteins that nucleate and processively elongate actin filaments. The formin homology domain-containing protein (FHOD) family of formins assembles actin-based structures in several biological contexts, including cell motility and sarcomere organization. Mammals have two FHOD proteins, FHOD1 and FHOD3, with largely distinct expression patterns and functions. FHOD1 assembles stress fibers that contribute to the adhesion, spreading, and motility of a wide variety of cell types. FHOD3 is predominantly expressed in striated muscle (skeletal and cardiac), where it is required for sarcomere organization. Altered expression of both FHOD1 and FHOD3 is associated with some cancers and cardiomyopathies. Despite the essential role of FHOD family members, and their relevance to several diseases, the mechanisms by which they carry out these functions remain poorly understood. Advances in this area have been largely limited by the inability to observe actin assembly activity with mammalian FHOD1 or FHOD3 in vitro. In contrast, we found that purified Drosophila FHOD potently accelerates actin assembly. Our ability to combine biochemical characterization of actin assembly with the genetic tractability of Drosophila makes this an attractive model system to study FHOD proteins. Drosophila has a single FHOD gene that is expressed in several distinct motile and contractile cell types, including macrophages, muscle, tracheal tip cells, and imaginal discs. How can the single FHOD gene in Drosophila be responsible for the diverse range of actin-based structures in these tissues? Drosophila FHOD has several splice variants, including four variations in its C-terminal tail. Because the tail modifies the activities of several other formins, we hypothesize that alternative splicing of the Drosophila FHOD tail tunes its activity, allowing each isoform to assemble specific actin structures. We will test this hypothesis by comparing the biochemical activities, expression patterns, and functional requirement of each isoform. The results of this work will provide insight into the role of the formin tail in regulating actin assembly activity, with implications for diseases such as cancers and cardiomyopathies, in which the expression or activity of FHOD proteins is altered. "
"9351881","Infectious diarrhea afflicts a billion people a year and is responsible for 4% of all human deaths. Many of the 2,500 serovars of nontyphoidal Salmonella enterica are common causes of infectious diarrhea in the general population, active military servicemen and veterans. As is the case for Salmonella, the number of bacteria resistant to antibiotics is steadily increasing. Antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacilli is becoming a clinical problem of epic proportions with few therapeutic agents in the horizon. Future prophylactic and therapeutic approaches against drug resistant bacteria will greatly benefit from a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis. The research of our group and many others has shown critical roles for the RNA polymerase regulatory protein DksA in the pathogenesis of multiple Gram-negative bacilli, including Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter, Haemophilus, Pseudomonas, and Vibrio. We have discovered that conserved cysteine residues in the DksA zinc finger are not only important for Salmonella pathogenesis but also represent a novel sensor of oxidative stress. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that the DksA zinc finger forms a stable sulfenic acid in response to low levels of oxidative stress, thereby activating transcription. At higher levels of oxidative stress, however, the oxidoreductase activity of the DnaJ chaperone catalyzes disulfide bond formation in DksA zinc finger, a redox state that represses gene transcription. This model is highly innovative because it defines DksA as a thiol multiplex with discrete regulatory outputs according to degree of oxidation of cysteine residues in the zinc finger. Our investigations will contribute to a deeper understanding of critical steps in bacterial pathogenesis and will also help the rational development of antibiotics against phylogenetically diverse Gram-negative bacilli. Based on our basic knowledge of DksA, we have already identified a drug that targets a pocket at the tip of the coiled-coil domain of this RNA polymerase regulatory protein. This novel compound has excellent antibiotic activity against Salmonella and E. coli. The proposed research will help develop and test novel antibiotics against conserved pockets in DksA. Our investigations will aid with the rational development of future therapies against a variety of Gram-negative, often antibiotic resistant, bacteria that cause high rates of morbidity and mortality in veterans and their families."
"9246028","Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease has been significantly controlled following the introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) [1]. This treatment dramatically improves immune function, suppresses HIV viral replication, and decreases morbidity and mortality [1, 2]. However, up to 25% of virologically suppressed individuals (~111,000 people in USA) fail to restore their CD4+ T cells to counts > 350 cells/µL, even after long- term ART treatment and viral suppression [3], and increased morbidity and mortality have been observed in these patients [4-7]. Thymic fibrosis has been suggested a mechanism, and low nadir CD4+ T cell counts and T cell activation have been shown to associate with incomplete immune restoration after ART treatment [8-11], but mechanisms for immune non-response remain largely unknown. To better understand mechanisms of incomplete immune restoration, we performed a preliminary human study in 12 healthy controls, 17 immunologic responders (IRs) (aviremic and ART treated > 3 years, and CD4+ T cell counts > 500 cells/µL) and 11 immunologic non-responders (INRs) (aviremic and ART treated > 3 years, and CD4+ T cell counts < 350 cells/µL) [8]. Elevated plasma levels of anti-CD4 IgGs were found in patients compared to controls and correlated with blunted CD4+ T cell recovery. Furthermore, purified anti-CD4 IgGs from plasma of aviremic long-term ART-treated subjects with CD4+ T cell counts below 350 cells/µl, defined as ?immunologic non- responders?, induced antibody-dependent NK cell-mediated cytotoxicity against CD4+ T cells. We hypothesize that heightened level of anti-CD4 Ab contributes to the pathogenesis of CD4+ T cell losses in HIV infection. If our hypothesis is correct, a therapeutic strategy that targeting autoreactive B cells or anti-CD4 Abs could potentially optimize ART treatment to improve CD4+ T cell recovery and reduce mortality and morbidity in treated HIV-infected patients. This study will also provide important information in HIV vaccine design."

"9265729","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This longitudinal study will identify specific pathways that are responsible for the link between personality and health in later life. It will employ enhanced assessment methods, including informant reports, interviews, and self-report measures of adaptive as well as maladaptive variants of personality traits. We will investigate psychosocial factors, biological pathways, and personality changes in relation to subjective health, diagnosis and treatment for specific medical disorders, and mortality. Personality traits will be considered both in terms of their protective (e.g., conscientiousness and health behaviors) and harmful functions (e.g., neuroticism and stressful life events). At the psychosocial level of analysis, three mechanisms will be examined as important mediators and moderators: health behaviors (e.g., use of tobacco and alcohol); exposure to environmental adversity (e.g., trauma, neglect, and on-going stressful life events); and social integration (e.g. intimate relationships, social networks, and community involvement). At the biological level of analysis, three additional mechanisms will be considered: neuroendocrine functioning (cortisol); immune system functioning (inflammation); and chromosomal stability (telomere length). Pathways between personality and health will be considered in terms of stable trait levels as well as personality change. Our data will allow us to examine health disparities, testing a variety of hypotheses concerned with both risk and resilience. For example, we will study the role that personality characteristics (e.g., mistrust and impulsivity) play in moderating the relation between environmental adversity and chronic illness. The study will extend data collection with a sample of participants that has already been studied for six years, beginning in 2007. The participants form a representative, ethnically diverse (33 percent African-American), community-based sample of 1,630 persons between the ages of 55 and 64 (when entering the study) ---those approaching the challenges of later life. All participants completed comprehensive assessments of personality, health, and social adjustment at baseline. Stressful life events, social adjustment, and changes in health were then monitored at regular six-month follow-up assessments, leading up to a second assessment of personality, which was conducted 2.5 years after baseline. During Phase II (the next project period), we will conduct two more personality assessments: the third will occur three years after the second, and the fourth will occur two years after the third. We will also collect blood samples to be used for measuring biomarkers at the time personality assessments three and four. Regular follow-up assessments of health, health behaviors, stressful life events, and social functioning will continue to be completed at four regular 6-month intervals following the third assessment. This project fills an important gap in knowledge regarding mechanisms that explain the connection between personality and health."
"9275417","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          It is being increasingly recognized that multiple pathways contribute to necrotic cell death in a highly regulated fashion and are amenable to specific interventions. Processes that have been implicated include necrotic cell death related to development of the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) regulated by cyclophilin D (CypD), necroptosis mediated by receptor-interacting protein kinases 1 and 3 (RIPK1 and RIPK3) and sensitive to inhibition by necrostatin-1, and pyroptosis resulting from activation of caspases 1 and 11. The ultimate downstream event required for several of the necrotic, immunogenic processes is glycine-sensitive opening of a plasma membrane channel. Preliminary studies for this proposal show that an additional pathway of iron-mediated cell death termed 'ferroptosis' may account for the iron-related cell injury involved in several common and clinically relevant forms of acute kidney injury (AKI). Ferroptosis is subject to modulation by novel small molecule inhibitors that emerged from chemical library screening, ferrostatins, as well as by other lipophilic antioxidants and by inhibition of NADPH oxidase. The objectives of this proposal are to further investigate and clarify the mechanisms of ferroptosis and its expression in freshly isolated kidney proximal tubules ex vivo, its impact on AKI in vivo, and its interactions with necroptosis and cyclophilin D pathways of regulated necrosis to address the hypothesis that regulated necrosis resulting from additive effects of ferroptosis, induction of the MPT mediated by CypD, and necroptosis contributes to tubule cell killing during AKI and is a target for pharmacological intervention. Studies will utilie tubules from rabbits and mice subjected to injury ex vivo and in vivo models of mouse AKI along with pharmacologic modulators and mutant mice deficient in CypD or RIPK3, newly developed mice deficient in both CypD+RIPK3 or caspase+RIPK3, and mice deficient in NADPH oxidase 4. Tubules isolated by collagenase digestion will be subjected to oxidant and iron-induced injury by tert-butylhydroperoxide or by hydroxyquinoline plus ferrous ammonium sulfate, or to hypoxia/reoxygenation. Lethal membrane damage will be quantitated as the final endpoint, and, at time points preceding that damage, measurements of ATP, mitochondrial membrane potential, reactive oxygen species production, and lipid peroxidation will be made to assess the mechanisms of this injury and its modification by ferrostatins, pharmacologic inhibitors of the MPT and necroptosis, and absence of pathway proteins. AKI will be produced in vivo by glycerol-induced rhabdomyolysis, clamp ischemia, or cisplatin followed by assessment of renal function and structural changes. These studies will further elucidate the role of newly characterized forms of regulated necrosis during AKI and provide insight into approaches for ameliorating them and the organ failure that results."
"9206065","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Background: Lung cancer is the number one cause of cancer death in men and women in the United States and remains an identified medical priority for the Department of Veterans Affairs due to the high rates of tobacco addiction acquired by military personnel. Recent data shows an actual increase in smoking rates among active military personnel and smoking rates among Veterans are consistently at least 10% higher than the general population (29% vs. 18%). The five-year survival rate for lung cancer remains 16%, a rate which has shown limited improvement over the last several decades. Among Veterans, only 16% of lung cancer is currently diagnosed at a curable stage. Large-scale screening trials (most notably the National Lung Screening trial - NLST) have been completed, and low dose CT scans were proven to significantly decrease lung cancer mortality (20%) when compared to chest x-ray. CT screening for lung cancer has been endorsed by many groups and a VA implementation study is being conducted. If CT screening is widely adopted in high risk groups (as defined by the NLST), there should be an increase in patients presenting with curable disease (stages I and II), leading to improved overall survival. Improved survival will result in a growing population of patients at ris for second primary lung cancers. The risk of developing a second primary lung cancer after curative treatment ranges from 3-6%. Former smokers are also at high risk of lung cancer, with greater than 50% of lung cancers in the US diagnosed in this group. The potential clinical impact of chemopreventive agents in this large, high-risk population emphasizes the need for continued studies. Improved success in decreasing lung cancer rates will rely not only on smoking prevention and cessation, but also on effective chemopreventive strategies. Work Accomplished: Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I2, PGI2) is a naturally occurring eicosanoid that possesses anti-inflammatory and anti-metastatic properties, as well as a suppressive role in tumor growth. We have found that the balance of these eicosanoids is pivotal in lung tumorigenesis and key mechanistic studies completed during the last grant cycle have shown that the observed chemoprevention may directly result from PGI2 and PGI2 analogues engaging the transcription activator PPAR¿ (peroxisome proliferator activated receptor gamma). These findings, coupled with clinical studies observing a 33% reduction in lung cancer rates among Veterans taking PPAR¿ agonists for diabetes mellitus, suggest PPAR¿ agonists may prevent lung cancer. My VA funded laboratory has focused on evaluating PGI2 as a chemopreventive agent, and animals with increased levels of PGI2 or receiving PPAR¿ agonists are protected from developing lung cancer. Most importantly, this led to a phase II clinical trial which showed oral iloprost improved endobronchial damage in former smokers. Our current human trial is evaluating pioglitazone is high risk current and former smokers. Proposed Research: This grant proposes to advance pre-clinical studies of PPAR¿ agonists in a squamous cell lung cancer model with a focus on the effects of PPAR¿ agonists on the tumor microenvironment (TME) and macrophage programming. We hypothesize that PPAR¿ activators (endogenous PGI2 and pioglitazone) will chemoprevent the development of endobronchial dysplasia and lung tumors, and will alter the TME by affecting inflammatory cell recruitment and phenotype. The following hypotheses will be tested: Hypothesis 1: PPAR¿ agonists promote anti-tumor effects by influencing the production of pro- and anti- growth factors by tumor associated macrophages. Hypothesis 2: Selective PPAR¿ agonists (endogenous prostacyclin and pioglitazone) chemoprevent the development of murine squamous cell lung cancer and pre-malignant endobronchial dysplasia by altering inflammatory cell populations and macrophage phenotype."
"9257251","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major global health burden and the associated morbidity and mortality are expected to expand in the next decades. Despite decades of research, no effective therapies exist to circumvent the irreversible alterations in lung structure and lung function decline. This failure reflects the complexity of COPD pathogenesis and our lack of understanding of the molecular and cellular responses to chronic cigarette smoke (CS) exposure. Further complicating our understanding of COPD is the fact that frequent viral infections challenge the immune system which magnifies pulmonary injury and remodeling in COPD. Our work has uncovered a role for natural killer (NK) cells, and the NKG2D activating receptor, as pivotal determinants of both the direct effects of CS exposure and the subsequent innate response to influenza that exacerbates disease progression in COPD. The present application examines mechanisms whereby chronic airway injury enhances NK cell-mediated inflammation and tissue destruction and the mechanisms whereby NK cell stimulation renders NK cells hyperresponsive to influenza infection. Given the important roles of NK cells in inflammation and the removal of infected or stressed cells, it is important to define the mechanisms that control NK cell function in COPD and define the mechanisms by which NK cells regulate the immune response to viral exacerbations in COPD. In this proposal, we hypothesize that chronic NK cell stimulation through the NKG2D receptor leads to a hyperresponsive NK cell phenotype which mediates both CS-induced pathologies and enhanced pathologies during viral exacerbations. We will explore the function of NK cells and the mechanistic role NKG2D activating receptor in viral exacerbations of COPD. Specifically, we will 1) Define the role of nucleic acid sensing toll-like receptors in regulating NK cell function n response to CS exposure, 2) Define NK cell effector functions and the role of NKG2D during viral exacerbations of COPD, and 3) Define NK cell function and NKG2D activity in COPD patients. We expect our research will identify key mechanisms involved in NK cell-mediated pulmonary pathology and allow us to identify therapeutic targets for CS- induced lung inflammation, injury and alveolar remodeling. Use of animal models allows us conduct mechanistic work in a model that replicates the principal pathologies and immune alterations reported in COPD patients and will have an impact on the interpretation of findings obtained in COPD patients by identifying molecular targets for intervention."
"9403748","Abstract: Helminth infections occur in populations worldwide and potentially modulate the immune response to unrelated pathogens. An important consideration in the field is that concomitant helminth infection could decrease the efficacy of vaccines. It is not known how helminth infection impacts the formation and function of effector cells. Using an ecologically appropriate model of mouse coinfection with H. polygyrus and vaccination with T. gondii, we find that helminth infection inhibited the differentiation of effector CD8 T cells. Furthermore, the effector CTLs that develop in coinfected mice exhibit an ?lethargic? phenotype, marked by a deficiency in Tfb1m and depressed mitochondrial biogenesis and defective effector cytokine response. Defective CD8 T cell differentiation was associated also associated with an upregulation of Spry2, a negative regulator of receptor signaling. Induction of defective effector differentiation by helminth coinfection was mediated by host IL-4 and IL-10. To advance mechanistic understanding of helminth induced effector lymphocyte lethargy, we propose three specific aims. In Aim 1, we will leverage our recently developed technical advances and insights to delineate how helminth coinfection negatively impacts CD8 T cell activation, proliferation and differentiation. In Aim2, we will interrogate the functional role of mitochondrial insufficiency in helminth-induced effector dysfunction. Finally, in Aim 3, we will dissect the role of Spry2 and CD8 T cell intrinsic IL4 and IL-10 signaling in helminth-induced lymphocyte lethargy. Together, these studies will advance mechanistic understanding of effector cell dysfunction and provide avenues for therapeutic reversal. !"
"9423398","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Revealing how our brain works is a great challenge but yet worth our every effort: it will not only illuminate the profound mysteries in science but also provide the key to understanding and treating neurological diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. The objective of the proposed three-year research is to develop a high- speed, high-spatial-resolution, deep-penetration photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) system for real- time imaging of action potentials in mouse brains. The proposed hardware imaging system will be unprecedented in the field of PACT in terms of frame rate and spatial resolving power, and the proposed use of voltage-sensitive absorption dyes in PACT is also novel. In comparison to existing high-resolution optical neuroimaging modalities such as two-photon microscopy, the proposed system will provide deeper penetration for whole mouse brain imaging.  The timing for such an exciting project is perfect due to the following recent events. Our unpublished ongoing works have shown for the first time that (1) PACT has reached x-ray CT like image quality (see images in the Aim 2 section) and (2) some of the voltage-sensitive fluorescent dyes provide excellent photoacoustic contrast (see data in the Aim 1 section). The ultrasound imaging industry has just started to sell standalone multi-channel data acquisition systems without bundling to a conventional linear-array ultrasonographic system that we do not need, and the users are given full access to the raw RF data. Massively parallel (512 channels) data acquisition enables real-time PACT. In addition to the RFA, the March publication in the Journal of Biomedical Optics by NIH Program Director, Dr. Jonathan D. Pollock, entitled Deep imaging technology needed for NIH BRAIN initiative,[1] urged our team to submit this grant application.  The specific aims include 1. Screen voltage-sensitive probes for photoacoustic imaging in cell culture preparations and optimize detection parameters.  2. Develop a fast, high-resolution, deep-penetration PACT system.  3. Use PACT to image action potentials in mouse brains in vivo."
"9347832","Abstract This SBIR phase 1 proposal is to demonstrate the pre-clinical safety and efficacy of a novel carbon-nanostructure-based X-ray computer tomography (CT) contrast agent (CA) for imaging and monitoring in patients with renal failure or at risk of contrast induced nephropathy (CIN). Routine contrast enhanced CT scans relays crucial information about diseases and injuries, thus aiding the clinician in improving diagnosis and management of patients. The present day CT CAs available on the market are all based on covalently bonded tri-iodinated benzene rings. However, they are all contraindicated for patients with renal insufficiency, diabetes, heart failure and thyroid dysfunction. Use of these CT CAs in these patient cohorts has been linked to CIN which deteriorates normal or further exacerbate pre-existing kidney functions. These adverse effects have been associated with high osmolality and viscosity CT CAs and the inability of these and even low or iso-osmolar and/or iso-viscous CT CA formulations to be completely eliminated of cytotoxic free iodine ions in solution. The technology detailed in this proposal builds on our previously reported novel carbon- nanoparticle based T1 iso-osmolar, iso-viscous Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) CA. This comprises of manganese (Mn2+) intercalated graphene oxide nanoplatelets (GNP) covalently functionalized with dextran, and named GNP-Dex. This formulation shows low acute toxicity, high blood stability and high renal clearance through the urine. For expanded multimodal use, we intercalated and covalently functionalized iodine ions to the inner graphene sheet layers. This method of sequestration of iodine prevents its dissociation as free ions into solution. This formulation we termed GNP-I. In vitro studies done on kidney epithelial cell culture demonstrated favorable GNP-I cyto-compatibility. Furthermore, at equimolar concentration of iodine, GNP-I showed very high CT (~10 times greater) radio-opacity signals in phantoms compared to the control?Iohexol (Omnipaque?) ? a commonly used CT CA. Thus these lower detection limits will allow the same clinical imaging performance at substantially lower dosages, thus lowering healthcare costs. Based on GNP-I characteristics, inclusive of its apparent higher safety and efficacy profiles than that of currently available CT CAs, the thrust in this proposal is to develop it specifically for monitoring and diagnosis of kidney and other vital organs for patients at risk of CIN. Thus, thereby overcoming the limitations of present day CT CAs. For this, we will conduct pre-clinical safety and efficacy feasibility studies in a well validated rodent model of acute kidney injury, that is, the 5/6 Nephrex rat. Successful completion of the aims outlined in this proposal will lead to submission of a SBIR phase 2 proposal to perform safety and efficacy pre-clinical studies in a suitable large animal model under good laboratory practice (GLP) followed by Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA. Furthermore, successful development will lead to the first FDA- approved CT CA specifically for use in these high risks, distinctly disadvantaged patient groups."
"9471466","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Duke University Division of Gastroenterology has been engaged in the training of clinicians and scientists in gastroenterology and hepatology since 1965. The philosophy has been to generate research questions from challenges that emerge in the care of patients through an environment that facilitates the relationships of clinicians and scientists. In the last decade, our program has been particularly successful in the placement of graduates into academic positions. Our goal is to maintain this history of productivity by creating an environment that facilitates the development of young investigators capable of pursuing successful research careers. With this competing renewal, Dr. Rodger Liddle and Dr. Andrew Muir have assumed the leadership as Co-Directors. In collaboration with the former Director and Executive Committee, the team has implemented a number of substantial enhancements to the experience of our trainees. The training program has been reorganized into two tracks with a basic/translational track led by Dr. Liddle and a clinical research track led by Dr. Muir. We have also reduced the number of faculty to those focused in gastroenterology or hepatology research. Although collaborations will continue to be sought across Duke and with neighboring universities, our goal is to strengthen the bonds of the gastroenterology and hepatology researchers to enhance the community environment of the research training program. Specific examples of other changes include: 1) reorganization of mentoring teams with the addition of a career mentor and broader representation among basic and clinical researchers; 2) application of the mentoring program design to junior faculty; 3) expansion of the junior preceptor program; 4) expansion of the recruitment process to diversify the applicant pool; 5) development of training for PhD fellows to gain clinical experience and develop working relationships with clinicians and clinical researchers; 6) a new Visiting Scholar Program funded by the Division of Gastroenterology to expose trainees to leading researchers; 7) an annual Duke GI Research Symposium with awards for the best fellow presentations; 8) development of a science culture and accountability plan to foster an environment where scientific integrity is the highest priority; 9) formation of a new External Advisory Committee. Th goal of this program is to continue training talented researchers and to build on the Duke environment that will ensure our postdoctoral fellows develop into highly successful, innovative, independent investigators."
"9214854","ABSTRACT While we know that African Americans are disproportionately arrested and incarcerated for drug-related crime, experience more severe consequences from substance use, and are disproportionately exposed to criminogenic risk factors ? there are several areas regarding the confluence of these factors that have been understudied. For instance, how do these concomitant factors converge within individuals and across time? Moreover, despite the higher risk of experiencing these outcomes, many African Americans successfully adapt, and yet we know little about the factors that protect individuals from drug use, criminal offending, criminal justice system interaction, and their adverse consequences. In the proposed project we seek to increase our understanding of patterns, pathways and trajectories of drug use, criminal behavior, and criminal justice system interactions for urban African Americans as well as identify the factors that decrease their co-occurrence and negative health consequences. The SPECIFIC AIMS of the proposed work are: (1) Identify and map the life course interrelationship of drug use and criminal justice system involvement for men and women, examining overlapping trajectories from adolescence to midlife, determining co-occurring patterns at each life stage, and estimating reciprocal effects over time; (2) Establish the short and long-term consequences of drug use, arrest and incarceration and their multiplicative impact on health; (3) Determine the individual and contextual protective factors that reduce the risk of and association between drug use, crime and criminal justice system involvement, and their negative health consequences. Method: Data are from the Woodlawn Study, which has followed nearly all children entering first grade in 1966 in Woodlawn, a poor Chicago community (N=1242) to age 52. Information from mothers and teachers, and official school, criminal, and death records have been integrated with reports from cohort members themselves to build an unmatched collection of comprehensive life course data of a population not adequately captured in national data sets. The experienced and uniquely qualified research team will employ sophisticated analytical approaches used in longitudinal research, including trajectory analysis, survival analysis, latent class analysis, latent transition analysis, structural equation modeling, conjunctive analysis of case configurations, and propensity score methods. The one-of-a-kind dataset spanning more than 40 years allows for in-depth exploration of both risk and protection. Implications: The project will challenge assumptions of African American homogeneity and help reframe the current deficit conceptualization to focus instead on protective effects, positive outcomes and recovery. The research will make unique and important contributions to understanding patterns, pathways and reciprocal effects between drug use, crime, and criminal justice system interaction for both men and women over the life course. Findings will inform intervention development by identifying critical pivotal points of influence along the life course that may alter risk trajectories. ! !"
"9324117","PROJECT SUMMARY: The national epidemic of obesity is also affecting older adults, and is associated with an increased risk of functional impairment, nursing home placement and early mortality. Conventional weight loss programs have the potential to reduce body fat, but are difficult to access for older obese adults due to transportation and mobility challenges. They may also lead to a detrimental loss of muscle and bone, paradoxically resulting in increased disability. The overarching goal of this Mentored Career Development Award is to develop the skills to become an independent researcher in community-based translational geriatric obesity research integrating innovative technology including mobile Health (mHealth), sensors, and video-conferencing with behavioral management to improve physical function. I will build upon the knowledge gained in my prior work using descriptive research to acquire the necessary skills and knowledge in this 5-year award to become an independent R01 investigator in geriatric obesity interventions research. Mentored activities, training, and coursework in key content areas will include: clinical trial methods (qualitative and quantitative); delivery of community-based obesity interventions using applied methods of telemedicine in rural populations; and enhancing health promotion using mHealth and sensors to facilitate behavioral change in older obese adults. Concurrently, I will conduct a program of pilot research aimed at developing and evaluating a technology assisted wellness intervention for obese older adults. First, I propose to assess the acceptability, usability, utility and perceived value of mHealth technology for obese older adults using a novel, adaptable mHealth device (Amulet) with remote sensing and self-monitoring capabilities, including strength, function, activity type, and real-time feedback (Qualitative assessment and Adapting Amulet). Second, I will conduct a single-arm, pilot feasibility study evaluating the potential effectiveness of a mHealth obesity wellness intervention (MOWI) for older obese adults in improving physical function (Develop & Refine MOWI). MOWI integrates Amulet with a weekly individual dietician-led nutritional session, along with twice weekly physical therapist led group exercise session. I will pilot test MOWI in a research-based setting over a 3-month period, and then deliver the intervention in the home setting using video-conferencing over a 6-month period (Evaluate Home MOWI). The primary clinical outcome is physical function, measured by observed muscle strength, observed physical fitness, and observed and self-reported life-task functioning. Secondary (exploratory) outcomes will include behavioral activation, objective physical activity, subjective health status, and subjective physical activity. The findings on the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary estimates of effectiveness will be used in a future competitive application for an extramural R01 assessing the effectiveness of a home Telehealth-delivered MOWI in improving physical function in high-risk obese older adults as compared to an in-person intervention."
"9341057","microRNA (miRNA) signaling in Alzheimer's disease (AD)  Through extensive miRNA- and DNA-based expression array-, LED-Northern-, ELISA, Western-, immunological and bioinformatics-based analysis we have discovered a highly interactive network of NF-kB sensitive, up-regulated pro-inflammatory microRNAs (miRNAs) and their down-regulated messenger RNA (mRNA) targets and the proteins these mRNAs encode in sporadic Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain. The up-regulation of these pathogenic miRNAs and their down-regulated mRNA targets has been further analyzed in stressed human brain cells in primary culture and in 5xFAD amyloid over-expressing transgenic mouse lines. Through miRNA and mRNA abundance analysis, miRNA-mRNA complementarity mapping, association energy (EA) indexing, ELISA and Western analysis we can explain much of the observed neuropathology characteristic of the AD process by analyzing significant disruptions in selective miRNA-mRNA signaling. Our hypothesis is that there exists a small family of at least 6 critical pro-inflammatory miRNAs in AD brains responsible for targeting and down-regulating a group of pathogenic messenger RNA (mRNA) targets responsible for amyloidogenesis, tau pathology and neuroinflammation with accompanying deficits in synaptogenesis, innate- immunity, phagocytosis and a progressive impairment in A?42 peptide clearance.  This renewal of our previous 5 year NIA R01 will investigate the integrated actions of this group of 6 pro-inflammatory, pathogenic miRNAs up-regulated in sporadic AD brain, in stressed human brain cells in primary culture in the brains of 5xFAD mice. The 6 up-regulated pro- inflammatory microRNAs to be studied in detail are miRNA-7, miRNA-9, miRNA-34a, miRNA-125b, miRNA-146a and miRNA-155. Stressors will be those encountered as are found in aging AD brain ? these include reactive oxygen species (ROS), the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1? and TNF? and A?42 peptides. Specific Aim 1 will analyze the contribution of these factors in moderate-to- advanced sporadic AD and Down's syndrome (DS) brain; Specific Aim 2 will analyze the contribution of these factors in stressed human brain cells, i.e. in neuronal-glial primary cell co- cultures; Specific Aim 3 will analyze the contribution of these factors in 5xFAD amyloid over- expressing transgenic mouse lines. We will specifically accentuate the study of the most up- regulated miRNAs: miRNA-7, miRNA-9, miRNA 34a and miRNA-146a and their targeted disruption of UBE2A (ubiquitin conjugase protein) and TREM2 (triggering receptor expressed in microglial cells) signaling in AD brain, and in in vitro and in vivo AD models. We will also analyze the applicability of selective NF-kB inhibitors and anti-miRNA (AM) strategies in restoring homeostasis in this system. Our long term goal is the therapeutic manipulation of these miRNA-regulated epigenetic pathways to provide an efficacious treatment for the clinical management of AD at an early stage."
"9270482","?DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overarching goal of this project is to deepen our understanding of the aging brain in a well characterized community-based longitudinal prospective cohort study. The Adult Changes of Thought (ACT) study enrolled a cohort of 2,581 Group Health participants in 1994-1996, an expansion cohort of 811 in 2000-2002, and in 2005 began continuous enrollment to keep 2,000 people alive and at risk for dementia outcomes; total enrollment to date is nearly 5,000. Extensive and unmatched clinical and research study data are available for study participants. Autopsy consent is sought; 560 autopsies have been completed to date, and more than a third of active participants have signed autopsy consents. Investigators propose three aims. Aim 1 addresses MULTIMORBIDITY: the single and joint effects of blood pressure, glucose, and cholesterol, and their treatments, on the aging brain. Outcomes include time to dementia and Alzheimer's disease, cognitive functioning, standard neuropathological indices, and newly developed quantitative measures of regional Aß, tau, and synaptophysin. This aim leverages important methodological innovations, including hierarchical Bayesian modeling of exposure trajectories to incorporate sporadically collected clinical data, modern psychometric approaches to cognitive data, use of marginal structural models to account for selection bias for autopsy studies, new criteria for neuropathological assessment of AD, and the newly developed quantitative measures of neuropathology. Aim 2 addresses RESILIENCE: why some people do well despite factors associated with doing poorly. Aim 2a addresses the role of physical activity on trajectories of cognition and physical performance, using accelerometers to address the amount and type of activity associated with protection. Aim 2b addresses factors associated with living to age 85 while preserving cognition and mobility, specifically focusing on physical activity and on medical comorbidity. Aim 2c addresses factors associated with avoiding dementia despite accumulation of neuropathology. In particular, Aim 2c will focus on synaptic contents, applying flow cytometry of a synaptosome preparation. Aim 3 addresses a LIVING LABORATORY: continuing to serve as a resource to researchers around the world."
"9329351","Aging is associated with an enhanced pro-inflammatory environment that may contribute to increased morbidity and mortality from infections along with decreased vaccine responses. Dysregulated inflammation arising from chronic infections such as HIV (even on antiretroviral therapy (ART)) is likely to potentiate this age-associated pro-inflammatory state and result in worsened impairments in immune responses. The interplay of inflammatory dysregulation, aging and HIV infection has consequences for the management of the rapidly expanding population of HIV-infected older adults. This inflammatory dysregulation reflects immune activation mediated by innate immune pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Here we investigate the C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), Mincle and Dectin-1, which are critical for the innate immune recognition of mycobacteria and fungi. Mincle is the receptor for trehalose 6,6' di-mycolate (TDM) or ?cord factor,? an abundant glycolipid in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a leading cause of death worldwide, with increasing incidence of reactivation disease in both older adults and HIV infected individuals. Dectin-1 mediates the innate recognition of ?-glucan components of cell walls from fungi. In addition, both Mincle and Dectin-1 also recognize endogenous ligands associated with cellular damage or necrosis, and may consequently contribute to the pro-inflammatory milieu beyond pathogen-associated responses. However, the effects of aging and HIV infection on Mincle and Dectin-1 function, remains unknown. The purpose of this proposal is to evaluate the effects of aging and HIV infection on Mincle and Dectin-1 function in an exploratory cohort of HIV-positive and HIV-negative young and older adults. We will carry out a comprehensive evaluation of human Mincle and Dectin-1 receptor function by stimulating with fungal/mycobacterial ligands and an endogenous damage- associated ligand to determine cytokine output and expression of costimulatory proteins in monocyte and dendritic cell populations. Our preliminary data already show dysregulation of cytokine production, including increases in the type and number of cytokines produced in the context of age and HIV infection. We will determine the signaling mechanisms underlying such changes in Mincle and Dectin-1 function by examining downstream signaling mediators, including the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Syk, CARD9 complex, and MAP Kinase and NF-?B-dependent pathways. Mincle and Dectin-1-dependent inflammasome activation will also be examined, including caspase-1 and 8 activation and ASC oligomerization. These studies will provide new insights into human CLR function; in addition, by interrogating innate immune receptor function instead of identifying elevations in plasma cytokines and other biomarkers, these studies should elucidate mechanisms underlying the pro-inflammatory state associated with age and/or HIV disease and identify pathways that could be targeted to enhance immune responses."
"9266405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     ABSTRACT  Myopia, or nearsightedness, is a visual condition that predisposes individuals in its extreme forms to blinding disorders such as retinal detachments, glaucoma, premature cataracts, and degenerative maculopathy. Myopia pathogenesis has not been precisely defined and there are no consistent effective treatments. Recent studies identifying causal genes in rare, inherited non-syndromic high-grade myopia, including our own study, have associated mutations in at least 3 genes, and each discovery has clarified molecular mechanisms of exaggerated eye growth. To build on this productive line of inquiry, we have ascertained and carefully characterized 230 families with familial extreme high-grade myopia. The objective of this proposal is to use this valuable and unique family resource to systematically identify causal genes for familial high-grade myopia in a subset of these families, using the remainder as cases or controls as well as using other collaborative cohort resources globally for replication purposes. Limitations of current conventional linkage and positional cloning approaches include their requirement for large, multiplex families. In addition, narrowing candidate areas in traditional linkage analysis can be difficult due to large regions that lack recombination events and hence these regions have required cumbersome and lengthy screening for causative mutations. Powerful new genetic tools can facilitate this screening process and improve variant discovery in smaller families. In particular, efficient whole-exome sequencing, the targeted capture of protein- coding gene sequences, should be particularly useful in our studies, as most Mendelian disorders are caused by mutations affecting exomes of the target gene. By combining genome-wide linkage analysis and whole- exome sequencing, we are maximizing the impact of our family data and accelerating novel myopia mutation identification. In recently published studies, we have identified novel genes highly associated with or causative of myopia. In this application, we propose to complete identification of causative loci from the Duke myopia dataset and then focus our characterization on those genes with unknown functions. By adding to the network of myopia-associated genes, and then assigning functions to those which are unknown, we provide essential information for understanding potential connections and pathways involved in this disease. We aim to: 1) Use targeted sequencing and/or whole-exome sequencing with linkage mapping to identify genetic variants associated with familial high-grade myopia, with prevalence determination in the Duke and other myopia datasets of these new causative mutations; 2) Characterize functional consequences of candidate causative mutations in zebrafish models, and perform comparative expression studies of ocular tissues in zebrafish to that in humans and mouse models of induced eye growth; and 3) Perform convergent gene list enrichment analyses and biological pathway analyses of sets of genes determined by refractive error genome wide association studies, whole exome sequencing, and expression studies to develop an integrated view of the mechanisms that might influence the process of emmetropization (normal refractive development). These efforts will significantly improve our understanding of normal eye growth signals and of the pathogenesis of myopia and related disorders with myopia as a cardinal feature. Moreover, our discoveries will reveal new opportunities to develop customized therapies for extreme and common myopia phenotypes."

To achieve these aims, in the next 5-year cycle (2014-2018) we will: (a) Collect data in person from the original NHATS cohort annually, including: continued collection of the enhanced disability protocol and supplemental questions on consequences including subjective and economic wellbeing, living and care arrangements, and quality of end of life; collection of dried blood spots, some to be assayed to foster study of the biologic risk for disability progression, and others to be stored for future use; enhancements to the NHATS interview in key understudied areas of potentially growing importance-use of rehabilitation services aimed at recovery from disability, and the service environment and related amenities that promote independent functioning in retirement and senior community settings-and incorporating new modules submitted by the broader research community. (b) Replenish the sample in Round 5 (2015). Replenishment will be implemented in such a way that NHATS maintains the ability to produce 5-year age estimates (including 90+) and Black-White comparisons. (c) Clean, document and disseminate public use files online and continue to make Medicare claims and other sensitive and restricted files available using established procedures. (d) Undertake methodological studies to improve the efficiency of data collection in future rounds, including testing the sensitivity of key estimates to differential follow-up periods and applying modern measurement approaches such as Item Response Theory (IRT) to measures of capacity. The overarching goal of NHATS is to be a platform for scientific inquiry to guide efforts to reduce disability, maximize functioning, and enhance older adults' quality of life. Research using NHATS will foster research to design multi-factor interventions to reduce late-life disability, and will support comprehensive modeling of outcomes of the disability process including living and care arrangements, expenditures, economic well-being, and quality of life."
"9375024","Abstract The thiopeptide antibiotics are an emerging class of natural products that exhibit formidable activity against drug resistant, Gram-positive pathogens, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, penicillin- resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, and vancomycin-resistant enterococci. These natural products are highly modified, sulfur-rich, cyclic peptides that feature a central nitrogen-containing six-membered ring of differing degrees of saturation that is tri- or tetra-substituted. Additional modifications include multiple thiazole or oxazole rings, and dehydro-amino acids. These antibiotics are generated from a precursor peptide that is synthesized ribosomally and then modified by a number of tailoring enzymes. One of these enzymes, NosN, a Class C RS methylase involved in the biosynthesis of nosiheptide, catalyzes the methylation of a carbon atom of a 3-methylindolic acid (MIA) molecule that becomes attached to the thiopeptide framework. The mechanism by which this reaction takes place is unknown, and is the focus of much of the proposed work. Additionally, the timing of attachment of the MIA moiety to the thiopeptide framework is unknown and will be similarly addressed by recapitulating the biosynthesis of the thiopeptide in vitro."
"9257250","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The main objectives of this VA Merit Review renewal proposal are to gain a better understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of bladder cancer and to utilize this information to devise improved diagnostic, preventive and therapeutic approaches for this disease. Bladder cancer is the fifth most prevalent cancer among the Americans and the costliest cancer to treat on a per case basis. However, despite its prevalence, clinical importance and high medical expenses, bladder cancer has historically lagged behind many other cancer types in research endeavors and hence new discoveries. As a result, highly reliable diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers and effective treatment modalities remain scarce. Research supported by this Merit Review Award has been focused on the molecular and genetic events that are capable of driving bladder cancer formation and progression along the divergent pathways. The approaches have concentrated on the development and analyses of genetically engineered mice by expressing or abrogating genes of interest or both in a bladder-specific and time-controlled manner. These studies have been highly informative regarding the tumorigenic ability or the lack thereof of candidate genes in bladder cancer formation, the gene-pathway association, the sequence of tumor development in the bladder, the collaborative relationship of different oncogenic events, the unique context of bladder epithelium in tumorigenesis and the mechanisms of tumor suppressor gene inactivation. Results from these studies underscore the need of combining different biomarkers for more accurate diagnosis and prediction of prognosis. These studies have also been instrumental in identifying potential targets that can be further explored for therapeutic intervention for bladder cancer clinically. This renewal proposal builds on the broad foundation established during the past funding period to tackle several new, hypothesis-driven and highly focused questions. Specifically, the renewal proposal will investigate, in three Specific Aims, the role of pyruvate kinase isoform 2 (PKM2), found during the preliminary studies to be highly expressed in mouse bladder cancer models, human bladder cancer cell lines and specimens, in bladder tumor initiation and progression. Specific Aim 1 is designed to identify signals in the mitogenic pathways that are capable of up-regulating and activating the growth-promoting functions of PKM2, an extremely important but under-explored area. Both specific-target-based and high throughput siRNA knock- down approaches will be employed with cultured human bladder cancer cell lines. Specific Aim 2 will investigate the in vivo role of PKM2 in bladder tumor initiation using complementary over-expression as well as knock-down approaches. Novel transgenic mouse lines will be engineered to over-express PKM2 and then be crossed to existing transgenic lines that bear tumor-precursor lesions, thus providing opportunity to determine whether PKM2 promotes bladder tumor formation. Additionally, PKM2 will be knocked down using isoform- specific shRNA and its effects on tumor growth will be examined in vitro and in vivo in xenograft and orthotopic models. Specific Aim 3 will evaluate whether inhibition of PKM2 with naturally occurring products, alone or in combination with chemotherapeutics, helps slow tumor growth in low-grade non-invasive as well as high-grade invasive bladder tumor variants. Together, these three series of studies should greatly enhance our understanding of the role of PKM2 over-expression in bladder tumorigenesis and progression and the prospect of using PKM2 as a diagnostic biomarker and/or a therapeutic target for bladder cancer treatment."
"9333166","Role of ?-actinin in Cav1.2 Function Abstract L-type Ca2+ channels are tightly coupled to gene transcription, control neuronal excitability, and mediate multiple forms of synaptic plasticity. Yet its cell biology and regulation is remarkably poorly understood. Our long term interest is to determine the molecular mechanisms that regulate the L-type channel Cav1.2 (e.g., Science 293, 98; Science 293, 2205; PNAS 103, 7500; Neuron 78, 483), which is the most prevalent L-type channel in brain and heart. We recently found that ?-actinin binds directly to the IQ motif of the central pore- forming Cav1.2 subunit ?11.2 and augments its surface localization (Neuron 78, 483). We now identify three point mutations in the IQ motif that individually impair ?-actinin binding. Our preliminary electrophysiological and surface labeling data suggest that impairing ?-actinin binding to the IQ motif decreases surface expression and, unexpectedly, also channel open probability (Po). Aim 1 is the very first comprehensive analysis of trafficking kinetics of WT and point mutated Cav1.2 through the ER-Golgi-TGN secretory pathway and endocytic recycling and degradation pathway by surface biotinylation, N-glycosylation analysis and colocalization with respective markers like BiP and Rab5. Aim 2 is to determine and compare current density, gating currents, and single channel currents to test whether the ?-actinin binding - deficient point mutations of Cav1.2 have decreased Po. Our structural analysis is guiding charge reversal experiments for unequivocal (!) assignment of deficits in surface expression and Po in the Cav1.2 mutants to loss of ?-actinin binding. We found that Ca2+ influx specifically through Cav1.2 leads to displacement of ?-actinin from the IQ motif by Ca2+/calmodulin and in parallel to run down of Cav1.2 via endocytosis and reduction in Po. Aim 3 is to unravel the interplay between ?-actinin and calmodulin at the IQ motif to precisely define the molecular mechanisms of how Ca2+/calmodulin displaces ?-actinin and leads to endocytosis and run down of Cav1.2. Aim 4 will test first the role of ?-actinin in neuronal Cav1.2 functions including Ca2+ influx into spines and regulation of gene expression via NFAT and then why ?-actinin association and, fittingly, surface expression of Cav1.2 is increased in rodent models of senility and Alzheimer?s disease (AD). Increased Cav1.2 channel activity contributes to senile symptoms and AD (e.g., Science 272, 1017; Science 243, 809). Cav1.2 also plays an important role in PTSD and dysregulation of Cav1.2 leads to autism spectrum disorders (Cell 119, 19-31). Thus our work on the functional interplay of Cav1.2 with ?-actinin and calmodulin is of high significance for understanding and ultimately treatment of these brain diseases. On a broader perspective it is of physiological importance as it will define important aspects that govern the functional availability of Cav1.2 with its manifold functions in neurons and beyond including learning and memory."
"9277876","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The PhenX Toolkit is a catalog of standard measures and associated bioinformatics tools intended to help investigators improve the quality and consistency of data collection and to identify opportunities for collaborative research. Evolving over time, the PhenX Toolkit has expanded beyond the initial focus on genome-wide association studies of common, complex diseases to include rare genetic conditions, Substance Abuse and Addiction, Mental Health, Sickle Cell Disease, and Tobacco Regulatory Research. The PhenX Toolkit currently includes 476 measures, which encompass 629 protocols, and more than 22,500 variables. Over the next 5 years, we propose several significant and innovative updates to the PhenX Toolkit to further support users and to meet the evolving needs of the research community. These include expanding the existing Toolkit ontology and implementing a graph (i.e., semantic or ontological) database to support improved navigation and the development of new bioinformatics tools to visualize the content of measures and identify opportunities for cross-study collaboration. The PhenX multidisciplinary team of researchers and developers, together with input from the scientific community, will increase the utility and impact of the PhenX Toolkit through the following Specific Aims. Overall Specific Aim 4: Link PhenX measures to established ontologies: The extended PhenX ontology (based on existing ontologies) will be implemented on the cloud and will enable nimble navigation and the development of tools for users to link and harmonize variables across studies. Overall Specific Aim 5: Provide new tools that investigators need: Develop an enriched interface that can traverse the increasing complexity of the Toolkit, support access by mobile devices, and leverage the PhenX ontology to develop novel tools for comparing measures and variables. Develop Faceted Navigation: The expanded PhenX ontology and implementation of a graph database will enable development of Toolkit faceted navigation to provide an interactive exploration of the PhenX measures. Develop Concept Visualization Tool: We will leverage the PhenX ontology to develop a Concept Visualization Tool for comparing the content of PhenX measures. The Concept Visualization Tool will enable users to determine which measure is most appropriate for their study and will help the PhenX Steering Committee and Working Groups identify gaps and redundancies. Develop Connect the Studies Tool: We will leverage the mappings between PhenX variables and the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP) and the extended PhenX ontology to develop the Connect the Studies Tool. For each PhenX variable, the Connect the Studies Tool will present users with the number of study participants associated with a specific level of data similarity. These technology updates and novel bioinformatics tools will reduce barriers to translational research, increase the consistency and quality of data collection, and revolutionize the way investigators think about data harmonization."
"9205174","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Combat-related mild Traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a leading cause of sustained physical, cognitive, emotional, and behavioral deficits in military service members, OEF/OIF/OND veterans, and generals public. Recent studies have also showed that mTBI substantially increases the risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the pathophysiology of mTBI is not completely understood and its long-term effects are controversial. Furthermore, the neuronal mechanisms for mTBI potentiating the likelihood of PTSD development are even less clear. A significant factor has been that conventional neuroimaging techniques such as MRI and CT have limited sensitivity in detecting physiological abnormalities caused by mTBI or PTSD, or predicting long-term cognitive and behavioral outcomes. CT and MRI are generally negative even in mTBI or PTSD patients who experience persistent post-concussive symptoms (PCS) and/or PTSD symptoms. A main goal of this application is to develop and validate a voxel-wise resting-state magnetoencephalography (rs-MEG) source imaging technique that will identify abnormalities and assist in the diagnosis of mTBI patients with and without PTSD on a single-subject basis. We will also apply rs-MEG source imaging to examine the abnormality in PTSD neurocircuitry in different frequency bands, and to use rs-MEG to investigate the neuroimaging basis of mTBI's potentiation of PTSD. We will study four groups of veterans (N=50 per group): 1) veterans diagnosed with mTBI without PTSD (mTBI-only group); 2) veterans diagnosed with PTSD without mTBI (PTSD-only group); 3) veterans diagnosed with comorbid mTBI and PTSD; 4) healthy control (HC) veterans. Specific Aim 1 will develop and validate a single-subject based, voxel-wise, MEG slow-wave (delta-band, 1-4 Hz) source imaging approach for assisting in mTBI diagnosis by detecting neuronal abnormalities not visible with conventional MRI/CT. We will establish a voxel-wise normative database for the rs-MEG slow-wave imaging approach using data from HC veterans, and assess specificity by cross-validating MEG data in a sample of HCs that are not part of the database. A non-parametric method based on bootstrapping will be studied to expand our analysis to voxels that fail to meet the required Gaussian distribution. We will then examine the positive detection rate (i.e., sensitivity) and test-retest-reliability of the MEG slow-wave source  imaging approach for detecting injuries in veterans from mTBI-only and comorbid mTBI-PTSD groups. The spatial distribution of the abnormal MEG slow-wave generation will also be studied at the group level to identify the brain areas that are particularly vulnerable to mTBI. Specific Aim 2 will use rs-MEG source imaging to examine abnormalities in PTSD-based neurocircuitry and to investigate the neural basis of mTBI's potentiation of PTSD development. In PTSD-only and comorbid groups, we will examine whether a model of PTSD associated with dysfunction in emotion processing neurocircuitry (i.e., amygdala, ventro-medial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), and hippocampus), can account for abnormalities detected by electromagnetic-based rs-MEG source imaging techniques for different frequency bands. We will also study the relationship between abnormal MEG signals in high-frequency bands from PTSD neurocircuitry and co-existing abnormal MEG slow-wave generation due to mTBI. Specific Aim 3 will use voxel-wise MEG source imaging to examine the neurophysiological basis of clinical symptoms and cognitive impairments in veterans with mTBI and/or PTSD. The success of this project will significantly improve neuroimaging-based techniques for efficient diagnosis of mTBI, and advance the understanding of the relationships among neurobiological, neuropsychological, and neuropsychiatric effects of mTBI, which are the foci of this Request for Applications."

"9275448","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a major public and VA health concern and exerts substantial burden on as many as 20% of soldiers returning from deployment in Afghanistan and Iraq. Evidence of cognitive and affective neuroscience approaches suggest that the medial frontal cortex (MFC) dysfunction during fear processing and emotion regulation is central in the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, much of this evidence comes from studies of older veterans from combat theaters from decades ago, and from brain imaging techniques that are relatively expensive with limited translation to clinical settings. Little is known about the neura mechanism involved in recovery from the disorder. The overarching goal of the present application is to advance an alternative approach to the study of brain function through the use of electroencephalography (EEG) measures of event-related potentials (ERP), a portable technique that can be deployed in the 'real world' office setting and provides time-locked stimulus neural response metrics that are reliable. Much of our recent work focuses on MFC ERPs reflecting neural reactivity to social signals of threat/danger and neural engagement during cognitive, volitional regulation of negative affect through reappraisal strategies - processes tightly related to avoidance of threat/danger and dysregulated affect, hallmark symptoms of PTSD. The proposed prospective, naturalistic longitudinal study will assess and follow the clinical status, trajectory and brain function during two validated ERP tasks involving threat processing and emotion regulation in veterans with PTSD (n=120) related to their combat trauma during deployment and in veterans (n=60) with similar levels of combat exposure who did not develop PTSD (CEC). Moreover, comprehensive clinical assessments, including close tracking of treatment, will be conducted at study entry, 6 months later and 12 months later to ascertain persistence of or recovery from PTSD. ERP imaging will also occur at entry, 6 months and one year later in order to address 4 Aims: 1) Characterize neurophysiological function during threat perception and emotion regulation in PTSD patients compared to CECs at study entry; 2) Compare neurophysiological function of patients with persistent PTSD and patients who recover and combat-exposed controls (CEC), one year later; 3) Relate change in neurophysiological function to change in PTSD symptomatology; and 4) Examine clinical and psychosocial moderators and mediators of the hypothesized relationship between neurophysiological function and PTSD symptomatology. The findings of this study will shed new light on the brain mechanisms underlying disturbances in appraising social signals of threat and emotion regulation in PTSD and the clinical relevance of this brain dysfunction to the maintenance of and recovery from PTSD. Such knowledge is critically important to identifying the appropriate brain targets to guide current interventions and innovating new interventions, aimed at primary and secondary prevention of PTSD in our returning soldiers."
"9206090","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Diabetes is an increasingly common disorder, recently estimated to affect 9.3% of the US population and 25.9% of individuals over 65 years of age (National Diabetes Statistics Report, June 2014). Because the VHA is a continuing system of care, all short- and long-term complications of diabetes are encountered in an expanding veteran group (Miller, 2004). Moreover, diabetes care in the VHA system is complex, since patients frequently have co-morbidities such as advancing age and post-traumatic stress disorder. Deleterious effects of diabetes on gastric function are highly prevalent and associated with considerable morbidity. However, the management of diabetic gastric complications remains unsatisfactory, despite an excellent record of adherence to accepted treatment guidelines, in part because mechanisms of gastric emptying abnormalities are so poorly understood. As a result, diagnosis of the underlying pathophysiology in individual cases is difficult, and since current treatment approaches are largely empirical rather than rationally designed, effective therapeutic options are often lacking. The study of the pathogenesis and treatment of gastric abnormalities in diabetes is complicated because: 1) symptoms may arise from either fast or slow gastric emptying; 2) gastric emptying is determined by the integrated response of independently regulated anatomic and functional regions of the stomach, so similar defects may result in either fast or slow gastric emptying depending on the region and/or cell type that is involved; and 3) different patterns of gastric motility regulate gastric emptying of solids and liquids during the digestive and inter-digestive periods; 4) finally, it is not entirely clear how best to use diabeti animal models in investigating diabetic gastroparesis. While many animal models of diabetes are available, it is unknown which of them most closely represents the features of human disease. Gastric emptying is regulated by distinct activities in gastric fundus, corpus/antrum and pylorus. Fast gastric emptying most often results from loss of inhibitory neurotransmission in the fundus, which is composed of tonic muscle and serves to store and accommodate ingested food by relaxing under the influence of inhibitory nerves. Slow gastric emptying often results from defective propulsive activity in the corpus/pylorus or defective relaxation of the pylorus. Defects  in smooth muscle, interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC) and neuromuscular neurotransmission have all been described in the stomach of diabetic animals, with loss of ICC and impaired nitrergic and cholinergic neurotransmission being the most consistent findings. However, we find that purinergic neurotransmission is also lost, suggesting that both vesicular and non-vesicular neurotransmission are impaired. The purpose of this proposal is to investigate the pathogenesis of diabetes-associated changes in gastric emptying. In Aim 1, we will investigate the spectrum of neurotransmission deficits in different stomach regions of diabetic mice with predefined fast and slow gastric emptying. These studies will be performed in different animal models of diabetes to determine the degree to which these models share a common pathophysiology. These studies will define the pathogenesis of fast and slow gastric emptying, and generate reliable, reproducible data in disordered diabetic stomach. In Aim 2, we will systematically examine the hypothesis that dysfunction of the intracellular cargo motor, myosin 5a (myo5a), is an important cause of neurotransmitter deficit in diabetic stomach. This hypothesis is based on our studies showing myo5a dysfunction results in impaired release of multiple neurotransmitters. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that hyperglycemia leads to elevated myo5a O-GlcNAcylation, suppressing its activity and inhibiting neurotransmission, as well as enabling its premature degradation. Elucidation of the pathway involved in suppression of enteric neurotransmission may identify novel targets of therapy for diabetic stomach."
"9398574","Project Summary/Abstract Accurate perception of others' emotion is critical for successful social interaction, yet it diminishes over the lifespan and is impaired across a wide range of disorders, including anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, autism, and schizophrenia. The current proposal builds on a computational model developed by the PI, which posits that perceptions of social categories, including emotion categories, are driven not only by bottom-up cues inherent to targets (e.g., facial features) but also top-down factors harbored within perceivers, such as context and expectations. Although recent studies have documented the impact of such top-down factors in emotion perception, the mechanisms underlying these top-down impacts and how ?deeply? they manifest at lower levels of visual representation is far less clear. The overarching goal of this proposal is to use cutting- edge neuroimaging and behavioral methods to understand basic mechanisms of facial emotion perception, and particularly the impact by expectations and context. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) will be used in conjunction with an innovative behavioral technique developed by the PI to accomplish 3 specific aims: (a) examine how context and expectations systematically bias the visual representation of a face's emotion, which is driven by OFC?FG interplay and depends on IFOF integrity; (b) test whether this top-down modulation is automatic and does not reflect some form of post-perceptual response bias; and (c) this mechanism this mechanism is shaped by inter-individual variability in emotion-conceptual knowledge, which provides a set of top-down expectations on the perception of facial emotion. The results will have numerous implications for the understanding of flexible emotion perception at the behavioral and neural levels, and will also help inform a variety of clinical processes involving the impairment of emotion perception and social dysfunction."
"9274921","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         A greater magnitude of gut microbial product translocation (MT) and gut permeability in women may have important clinical implications for risk of developing autoimmune diseases as well as resistance to infection and response to vaccines. Increases in the inflammatory CD14+CD16++ monocyte subset and enhanced monocyte activation in women may alter effector responses of these cells to bacterial and viral infection and to TLR agonists, resulting in an increased susceptibility to autoimmune disease in women compared to men. TLRs and TLR-signaling downstream cytokines (e.g., IFN-?IL-6, IL-1?TNF-?play a key role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases, and treatments against specific cytokines or TLR inhibitors are effective in SLE patients and murine models. We hypothesize that sex hormone mediated permeable gut and resultant increased magnitude of MT are fundamental drivers for pro-inflammatory cytokine production monocyte activation and sex bias in autoimmune disease. Understanding these mechanisms is likely to provide insights crucial for the development of sex-specific interventions for autoimmune disorders and other diseases sharing sex differences such as Hepatitis C and HIV. Sex-based differences in MT provide a model for analysis of the effects of MT and altered innate immune responses on adaptive immunity and disease pathogenesis in vivo. If our hypothesis is correct-that heightened MT or altered TLR responsiveness in healthy women results in heightened persistent immune activation and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and that heightened inflammation results in enhanced susceptibility and heightened disease activity in SLE-, a therapeutic strategy (e.g., mucosal protector/microbes) may help reverse high levels of persistent inflammation, thereby helping to reestablish normal immunity/tolerance in autoimmune diseases. SPECIFIC AIM 1: Determine the role of sex hormones in gut permeability and the magnitude of microbial product translocation in healthy controls and patients with SLE in vivo and in vitro. Our preliminary data show that premenopausal women have higher plasma levels of total bacterial rDNA, a marker of MT in vivo, compared to men and postmenopausal women. To understand the impact of microbial products from plasma and the gut on systemic immunity and SLE, we will analyze microbial genetic potential by metagenomic sequencing in plasma. SPECIFIC AIM 2: Determine the role of sex hormones in TLR4 responsiveness and monocyte activation. We hypothesize that gut permeability and heightened MT result in monocyte activation in women. We will assess monocyte subset differentiation and potential drivers on monocytes. We will analyze the relatedness/correlation between MT, TLR4 responsiveness, monocyte activation, levels of sex hormones, and SLE disease activity. SPECIFIC AIM 3: Determine the impact of estrogen on gut permeability and monocyte activation in a cohort of postmenopausal women. In this aim, we will analyze the magnitude of MT and monocyte activation in 40 postmenopausal women before and after receiving hormone replacement therapy. By defining mechanisms of sex differences in gut mucosal integrity, MT and systemic immunity and by demonstrating a relationship among gut permeability, MT, TLR4 responsiveness and monocyte activation in vivo, we will establish the plausibility of this model in the pathogenesis of SLE. These findings have broader implications including vaccine responses, infectious disease risk, and risk of other autoimmune diseases."
"9414470","Project Summary  Hyperglycemia is the hallmark of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and accelerates the development of atherosclerosis, which, in turn, precedes the development of major cardiovascular complications. In people with T2D, cardiovascular disease significantly contributes to mortality, accounting for 65%-to-80% of T2D deaths. The development of pharmaceutical agents that lower glucose while also treating cardiovascular disease is therefore a priority. However, current cardiovascular agents (statins, fibrates, antihypertensives) are only moderately efficacious in T2D, partly because these agents incompletely address certain vascular abnormalities, such as inflammation, foam cell formation and leukocyte recruitment to the arterial wall. Therefore, more effective interventions are needed that treat both hyperglycemia and atherosclerosis.  The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) in cardiovascular disease through the use of nanoparticle probes that target and image atherosclerosis. GLP-1 is an endogenous gut-derived hormone presently used in clinics in the form of peptide mimetics that provide glycemic control in patients with T2D. We and other investigators have demonstrated that GLP-1 exerts a multitude of effects on immune cells and has the potential to reduce atherosclerosis. We posit that GLP-1 may directly regulate immune cell behavior by activating its receptor, GLP-1R, thereby reducing monocyte recruitment to the plaque, potentiating macrophage and cholesterol exit, and resolving inflammation. In order to isolate glucose lowering and systemic effects of GLP-1 from its actions on immune cells in atherosclerosis, an effective drug delivery system would be required that favors accumulation of GLP-1 in lesional leukocytes. We propose to investigate locus-specific actions of GLP-1 with the use of engineered nanoparticles that will image lesional and blood leukocytes simultaneously delivering a payload of a GLP-1 mimetic within plaque. This technology activates the drug release in the plaque following the retention of MRI-visible nanoparticles facilitated by eat-me signals. The underlying mechanisms of the anti-atherogenic effects of GLP-1 will be evaluated by carrying out two specific aims: Specific aim 1 will determine the inflammatory and migratory phenotype of leukocytes that were targeted by nanoparticles or GLP-1 alone. Here we will assess acute effects of GLP-1 on immune cells. Specific aim 2 will define whether lipid or anti-inflammatory effects govern anti-atherogenicity of GLP-1. Here, we will investigate atherosclerosis inhibition depending on the locus of GLP-1 delivery following chronic treatment regimen. Organ-specific actions of GLP-1 will be explored using on-demand nanoparticle delivery via modern pegylation technologies. In sum, the significance of this proposal is that it addresses an urgent clinical need for improved treatment strategies targeting both hyperglycemia and atherosclerosis."
"9275383","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) constitute the major mesenchymal cell type of the liver and play pivotal roles in a wound response. Upon injury, HSCs undergo myofibroblastic trans- differentiation (MTD) to participate in scar formation and cause liver fibrosis and cirrhosis if injury is sustained. Our research to date demonstrates this MTD is caused by re-activation of morphogens such as Necdin, Wnt, and delta-like homolog (DLK1). Necdin directly upregulates Wnt10b via its binding to a putative Necdin site (GN box) of the canonical Wnt10b promoter. Wnt10b and DLK1 positively cross-regulate each other and epigenetically repress the HSC quiescence gene Ppar? to drive HSC MTD. This epigenetic regulation is caused by increased levels of the methyl-CpG binding protein MeCP2 which binds to the Ppar? promoter to recruit HDAC and the co-repressor HP-1? while stimulating expression of EZH2 for consequent H3K27 di- or tri-methylation at the 3' exons to silence the gene. Our results also suggest that canonical Wnt pathway increases MeCP2 protein via suppression of miR-212 and miR-132 which normally block MeCP2 translation. We also demonstrate HSCs transiently activated in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy express DLK1 which stimulates hepatocyte DLK1 expression via a paracrine manner to support early liver growth. This notion of HSC-hepatocyte crosstalk with DLK1 is also supported by our preliminary results in acute CCl4 injury model indicating initial DLK1 induction by activated HSCs is followed by DLK1 induction in regenerating hepatocytes.  To extend our research, we will test the hypotheses: 1) canonical Wnt pathway activates HSCs via downregulation of miR-212 and miR-132 and consequent MeCP2-mediated Ppar? epigenetic repression and 2) HSC-derived DLK1 is a novel mitogen which initiates liver regeneration via HSC-hepatocyte crosstalk. We will test the causality of reduced miR-212/132 in Wnt-mediated MeCP2 induction by expressing miR-212/132 mimics or anti-miR-212/132 under canonical Wnt antagonism or activation in HSCs (Aim 1a and b). Once the causality is established, we will determine whether or how canonical Wnt pathway epigenetically or transcriptionally repress miR-212/132 (Aim 1-c and d). To test the novel mitogenic role of DLK1, acute and chronic CCl4 mouse models will be used to determine temporal and cell-type specific expression of DLK1 by immunostaining and analysis of isolated HSCs vs. hepatocytes and to test the effects of anti-DLK1 antibody administration on liver fibrosis and regeneration (Aim 2-a and b). To determine respective roles of DLK expressed by activated HSCs vs. hepatocytes, we will render acute and chronic CCl4 hepatotoxicity to compound mice generated from Dlk1+(m)/flox(p) mice crossed with ?1(I) collagen promoter-Cre or Albumin-Cre mice to determine the effects of respective conditional knockout on liver fibrosis and regeneration. Collectively, these efforts will define upstream mechanisms of MeCP2 upregulation responsible for Ppar? repression in HSC MTD and the role of HSC-derived DLK1 in liver fibrosis and regeneration, and provide new insights into potential therapeutic targets for chronic liver disease."
"9316903","Project Summary/Abstract Pregnancy impacts the maternal immune system and breast cancer risk, but whether these effects are related is unknown. Many women are immunologically primed to fetal antigens during pregnancy due to the unique expression of paternally- inherited antigens by the fetus. However, whether this priming has any consequence on subsequent progression of diseases in women is unknown. Tumor antigens are proteins that have limited expression in normal adult tissues, but are strongly expressed in many cancers, including cancer of the breast. Because of their ability to induce immunity, there is strong scientific and medical interest in exploiting this property for development of anti-cancer vaccines. Despite their restricted expression patterns, several, which we call shared placenta/tumor antigens, are highly expressed in the placenta. Investigators have long speculated that trophoblast cells and tumor cells share similarities, but the immunologic relationship between shared placenta/tumor antigens, breast cancer, and pregnancy are completely unknown. In this proposal, we explore the hypothesis that shared tumor/placenta antigens are immunogenic during pregnancy. These experiments serve as critical proof of concept experiments, with which we can further explore the long term hypothesis that immune priming to shared placenta tumor antigens during pregnancy alter breast cancer risk in parous women. To determine whether the placenta primes the maternal immune system against shared placenta/tumor antigens, we propose the following Specific Aims: 1. Determine whether the murine maternal immune system is primed to shared tumor/placenta antigens. 2. Test women for evidence of sensitization to shared placenta/tumor antigens. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a long-term consequence of the physiologically normal maternal immune response to fetal antigens will be considered in light of a critical clinical problem: women's cancer. In the long-term, this work could profoundly impact our understanding of why parity changes risk of breast cancer, and lead to insights into novel cancer prevention and therapeutic strategies."
"9268794","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of clonal blood disorders characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis that can lead to bone marrow failure and progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Aberrant DNA hypermethylation is characteristic of this disorder and, as such, DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DMTis) are often used to treat MDS in lieu of conventional chemotherapies that have proven to be ineffective for this disease. However, even with DMTi therapy, only about one third of MDS patients achieve a clinical response leading to a survival benefit. Moreover, current DMTi-based regimens for MDS require a minimum of 6 months of treatment before a patient can be deemed resistant to this therapy. Given that only ~30-40% of patients respond to this treatment, the majority of patients will spend 6 months receiving a therapy to which they are unlikely to respond. Therefore, the identification of molecular differences that distinguish between sensitive and resistant patients at the time of diagnosis is critical in order to harness these differences for the development of molecular biomarkers predictive of DMTi response. These biomarkers would allow us to more accurately risk-stratify these patients and prevent unwarranted and ineffective therapy for resistant patients. Using next-generation sequencing technology we performed genome-wide DNA methylation, gene expression and mutational analysis on a cohort of patients with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), an MDS/MPN overlap syndrome, including both sensitive and resistant patients to the DMTi Decitabine (DAC). We found that robust epigenetic and gene expression differences exist between DMTi responders and non-responders. From these differences, we were able to develop an epigenetic classifier that predicts response to decitabine therapy in these patients with 87% accuracy. Moreover, using RNA-seq we identified a gene expression signature associated with primary resistance to DAC in CMML. Based on these data, we hypothesize that comparable differences are likely to be found in MDS patients who are either sensitive or resistant to the DMTi Azacytidine (AZA), and that these too have the potential to be used as the basis of a molecular classifier of response as well as to identify mechanisms of primary resistance to the drug. We propose to perform genome-wide studies DNA methylation and expression studies in a cohort of 250 MDS patients treated with AZA in order to identify DNA methylation and expression biomarkers predictive of response to this agent in MDS. From these studies, we expect to be able to develop clinically useful biomarkers that can be translated to CLIA-compatible technologies that can be applied in molecular diagnostics labs."
"9281267","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Metastasis is responsible for 90% of cancer associated mortality indicating the need for new therapies targeted specifically toward preventing and/or eliminating metastasis. Cells originating from breast tumors display distinct organotropic metastasis patterns and hone specifically to lung, brain, or bone. Once a distant tissue is infiltrated, these cells often lay dormant for many years, or even decades, before reverting to an actively proliferating state. These dormant micrometastases composed of single cells, or small cell clusters, are highly resistant to conventional chemotherapies that only effectively treat actively proliferating cells. While animal models have traditionally been used for therapeutic screening, resolution limitations of in vivo imaging modalities make it difficult to quantify the effectiveness of new therapies targeted toward preventing extravasation or eliminating dormant micrometastases. To circumvent this limitation, we propose the generation of a vascularized in vitro metastasis model to induce organotropic extravasation and formation of dormant metastases. We will utilize our expertise in the development of biochemically and mechanically tunable synthetic hydrogel constructs to generate tissue-specific environments that allow for cancer cell infiltration via extravasation and that induce a dormant state in extravasated cells. We have recently developed an image-guided, laser-based hydrogel degradation technique that allows for fabrication of 3D microfluidic networks that accurately recapitulate the complex, dense architecture of in vivo vasculature in vitro. We will combine this new technology with our expertise in the fabrication of engineered microenvironments to generate a 3D vascularized in vitro model composed of organ-specific microtissues that recapitulate the biochemical, mechanical, and hemodynamic properties of brain, lung, and bone tissue to generate an organotropic breast cancer model that induces dormancy upon cancer cell infiltration. Through this funding mechanism we will organize our research to achieve the following objectives: (i) generate organ-specific tissue constructs that recapitulate the mechanical, chemical, and hemodynamic properties of brain, lung, and bone tissue that allow for infiltration and induce dormancy in highly metastatic cancer cells, (ii) demonstrate the ability to induce organotropic extravasation of breast cancer cells with genetic signatures known to induce metastasis specifically to brain, lung, or bone, and (iii) demonstrate the ability to quantitatively monitor extravasation, infiltration, and dormancy. This in vitro device to model organ- specific formation of dormant metastases could provide significant insight into the environmental mechanisms that govern organotropic metastasis, formation of dormant metastases, and aid the development of new therapeutics targeted specifically toward halting extravasation or eliminating dormant micrometastases."
"9261620","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of death in Africa, accounting for an estimated 80% of the mortality and morbidity. If this epidemic is left unabated, the scant medical resources in Ghana and other Sub- Saharan African (SSA) countries would be depleted by the disability from cardiovascular-related complications. To address this issue, the NIH Fogarty International Center (FIC) funded our NYU/University of Ghana Cardiovascular Research Training (CaRT) Institute to train local researchers in skills to conduct methodologically and scientifically rigorous research with the ultimate goal of improving cardiovascular health in Ghana and SSA. Our deliberate strategy of providing training in Ghana rather than the United States is to mitigate the risk of  brain drain  that is often inherent in sending African scholars abroad for training. Our long- term goal is to produce a sustainable network of individuals who are exceedingly well trained in various aspects of cardiovascular research and poised to assume leadership roles in academic cardiovascular medicine. Although the CaRT curriculum introduces scholars to the basics of information and communication technology (ICT) resources available to assist with research education and projects, it is not a focus of training. In response to the FIC request to establish health research ICT training for researchers in low and middle income countries, we propose to leverage the research capacity established by our CaRT program to develop an innovative curriculum for expanding the use of ICT and for building research eCapacity in Ghana. Our proposed CaRT ICT training and eCapacity initiative will complete these aims: 1) Establish a curriculum for increasing CaRT trainees  knowledge and skills necessary for incorporating ICT tools into their cardiovascular research; 2) Provide continuous in person and online ICT support for CaRT trainees; 3) Evaluate the effectiveness of the CaRT ICT curriculum and eCapacity building. Our proposed enhanced curriculum includes didactic courses to introduce trainees to the ICT lexicon of terminology, educational communications and technology theory, and exemplars of freely available ICT resources for conducting health research. ICT tools will be selected in partnership with CaRT trainees and mentors based on ease of use and advanced features for conducting high fidelity research. Trainees will also learn through research apprenticeships, using ICT resources in their own research. We will provide iPad mini devices for research design and data collection, and trainees will have access to technical support from locally trained ICT experts and a NYU based call center accessible via distance learning technology. By further developing our curriculum to emphasize research ICT, we will establish three cohorts of ten adaptable users of research ICT, who share their skills with local collaborators, thereby increasing Ghana's research eCapacity for conducting cardiovascular health research."

"9275315","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most widely recognized monogenic form of small vessel disease (SVD), a common cause of stroke and dementia. By comprehensively understanding the molecular basis of CADASIL, we hope to identify molecular pathways which can be targeted to treat SVD. Most patients with CADASIL have mutations in NOTCH3, a gene expressed selectively in vascular smooth muscle. This has led to the hypothesis that CADASIL is caused by NOTCH3-induced impairment of protein clearance, cell separation, and smooth muscle cell death. Recently, mutations in the major basement membrane protein COL4A1 (vascular type IV collagen) have also been identified in familial SVD, suggesting that smooth muscle extracellular matrix abnormalities can also result in SVD. In this proposal, we hypothesize that NOTCH3 and COL4A form a functional unit that plays a central role in SVD. In preliminary studies, we show that 1) NOTCH3 and COL4A1 both accumulate and co-localize in blood vessels in CADASIL; 2) NOTCH3 and COL4A1 form stable molecular complexes; 3) NOTCH3 function is blocked by COL4A1; 4) mutant NOTCH3 protein upregulates COL4A1 transcription. Consequently, we hypothesize that mutant NOTCH3 enhances COL4A1 accumulation, which blocks Notch regulation of smooth muscle genes and inhibits Notch clearance, leading to smooth muscle death. Three aims will be pursued: (1) We will biochemically characterize interactions between NOTCH3 and COL4A. (2) We will test whether COL4A inhibits NOTCH function and clearance and promotes smooth muscle cell death. (3) We will examine NOTCH3 and COL4A in CADASIL mice and human cases of CADASIL to determine whether CADASIL is associated with genetic or epigenetic changes in the COL4A locus. By understanding the molecular underpinnings of CADASIL in detail, we hope to accrue knowledge essential for developing rational treatments for SVD."

"9260020","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cardiovascular Toxicity of Tobacco Products The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act grants the FDA the authority to regulate tobacco products to protect public health. However, to set standards for tobacco products, it is important to know which components of conventional, new and emerging tobacco products induce cardiovascular injury so as to provide toxicity thresholds for harmful and potentially harmful constituents (HPHC) in tobacco products. However, to identify HPHC toxicity, it is important to determine how this toxicity could be identified and associated with disease risk and what assays best compare the toxic properties of different tobacco products. Although for toxicological profiling a high-throughput in vitro method is preferable, CVD is a complex disease that develops from the dysfunction of several organ systems. Therefore, the cardiovascular toxicity of tobacco products cannot be estimated in simple in vitro systems. Hence, we will use an animal model and determine the relative toxicity of major HPHCs in cigarette smoke and electronic cigarette aerosol, determine the toxicity profile of individual HPHCs, specifically aldehydes, and assess how the toxicity of an individual HPHC is modified by other HPHCs and nicotine. To validate this toxicity profile in humans, we will examine the relationship between exposure to different HPHCs and cardiovascular toxicity in a well-characterized cohort. Successful completion of this project will lead to quantitative and rigorous evaluation of the cardiovascular toxicity of the major HPHCs in tobacco products and to the validation of an association between exposure to individual HPHCs and cardiovascular toxicity in humans. These findings will provide new information regarding the contribution of individual aldehydes in HPHC mixtures to the cardiovascular toxicity of tobacco smoke and, as such, will be useful in developing informed threshold limits and the policies needed to regulate HPHC levels in cigarettes, electronic cigarettes, smokeless tobacco as well as in other emerging tobacco-derived products."
"9259643","ABSTRACT Blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption is a pathological hallmark of many neurological diseases, including stroke, multiple sclerosis (MS), Alzheimer?s disease (AD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Compromise of BBB integrity results in leakage of blood proteins into the brain parenchyma. Leakage of blood proteins into the brain may precede neurodegeneration and cognitive decline, but the molecular link between vascular damage and neurodegeneration is unknown. Fibrinogen, a critical component of blood coagulation, extravasates into the brain after vascular damage or BBB disruption. In humans, elevated plasma fibrinogen is a risk factor for cognitive impairment, and fibrinogen has been detected in the brains of patients with MS, schizophrenia, HIV- encephalopathy, ischemia, AD, and normal aging. Studies in animal models show that fibrinogen contributes to neurological disease by exacerbating inflammatory and neurodegenerative processes. Indeed, genetic or pharmacologic depletion of fibrinogen reduces neuroinflammation and reverses paralysis in MS models and protects against neuroinflammation and cognitive dysfunction in AD models. These studies suggest that fibrinogen is a major contributor to neurological dysfunction, however, the precise effects of fibrinogen on neuronal functions are not yet well understood. My long-term objective is to identify the molecular pathways mediating the effects of fibrinogen on disease pathogenesis as an essential step toward the development of therapeutic strategies that specifically target the damaging functions of fibrinogen in the CNS without affecting its beneficial effects in blood coagulation. My major hypothesis is that fibrinogen leakage drives neuronal dysfunction and cognitive impairment via activation of the CNS innate immune response. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary data showing that (1) stereotactic injection of fibrinogen into the dentate gyrus induces microglia activation and cognitive impairment; (2) fibrinogen induces dendrite retraction and spine elimination, as shown by in vivo 2-photon (2P) microscopy; (3) genetic depletion of the CD11b/CD18 microglial receptor prevents fibrinogen-induced spine elimination and dendritic retraction; (4) BBB disruption by controlled cortical impact results in massive parenchymal deposition of fibrinogen; and (5) Fibrinogen depletion or genetic inhibition of fibrinogen binding to the microglial CD11b/CD18 receptor reduces cortical damage after CCI. I propose to determine whether fibrinogen is necessary for cognitive deficits in a model of TBI (Aim 1), investigate the in vivo effects of fibrinogen on neuronal dysfunction (Aim 2), and determine the mechanisms by which fibrinogen induces neuronal dysfunction (Aim 3)."
"9231361","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     ABSTRACT Viral latency has emerged as the main barrier to eradicating HIV-1 infection. The current theoretical paradigm for eliminating the viral reservoir is known as `Shock and Kill'-i.e. reactivation of latent virus using non- targeted small molecules. However, significant hurdles must be overcome for this approach to be successful. These include stochastic viral reactivation, avoidance of global T-cell activation, and limited cellular death upon viral reactivation. Thus, an alternative strategy for targeting HIV-1 latency would make use of biomarkers to identify and selectively target latently infected cells in vivo without the need for reactivation. Additionally, these biomarkers would be invaluable for in vitro research given that patient-derived, native-state latently infected cells could now be purified for study. Unfortunatel however, such biomarkers do not currently exist. Here, we propose a multi-pronged, systems-biology based strategy to identify latency biomarkers in primary CD4+ T-cells. We propose to use a novel dual-fluorescence reporter HIV-1 genome to identify, quantify, and purify latently infected cells early post infection (<4 days), and without reactivation. Infection of primary CD4+ T-cells with this virus yields a reversible state of HIV latency in ~30% of infection events, which is a much higher frequency than many other currently used primary cell latency models. This model's unique set of characteristics is fundamental to our proposal to use a powerful combination of phenotyping tools to characterize the cells that become latent after HIV-1 infection of primary CD4+ T-cells. These tools will include: 1. CyTOF single-cell analysis of cell-surface markers, T-cell signaling networks, and T-cell effector function. 2. Quantitative mass spectrometry based identification of cell surface proteins enriched on latently infected cells in comparison to productively infected cells; 3. RNAseq and microRNAseq analysis of the cellular transcriptome of latently infected cells in comparison to productively infected cells. Most importantly, we will also screen our list of putative biomarkers for their predictive utility. Thiswill be done by validation not only in cells infected in vitro with the dual fluorescence virus, but als ex vivo in CD4+ T-cells isolated from HIV infected patients. We believe that this multi-pronged validation approach is vital to identifying bona fide biomarkers, and is likely to yield targets tht are invaluable for ex vivo validation of novel HIV-1 latency modulating therapeutics."
"9412564","Defining the role of Pou6f1 in cardiac morphogenesis PROJECT SUMMARY Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of birth defects and continues to carry a poor long-term prognosis despite marked improvements in contemporary management. This failure stems from severely lim- ited diagnostic capabilities coupled with a complete inability to modify the underlying disease process. Alt- hough the transcriptional pathways responsible for heart development have been well-characterized, new regulators of the established circuitry are urgently needed to identify novel CHD candidate loci and illuminate potential therapeutic targets. The long-term goal of this research program is to understand transcriptional con- trol of cardiac lineage specification using atrioventricular canal (AVC) differentiation as a model system. The objective of this proposal is to characterize a recently identified upstream regulator of AVC specification. Our central hypothesis is that Pou6f1 regulates cardiac structure and function. To test this hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims: 1) Analyze cardiac phenotypes resulting from Pou6f1 over-expression and 2) De- termine the impact of Pou6f1 deletion on cardiac function. Our preliminary data indicate that cardiac-specific over-expression of dominant-negative Pou6f1 perturbs AVC morphogenesis and results in embryonic lethality. In Aim 1, we will examine the consequences of Pou6f1 gain-of-function during heart development by utilizing two mouse lines for tissue-specific Pou6f1 over-expression that we have generated in our lab. Additional pre- liminary results show that global Pou6f1 deletion causes male-specific embryonic lethality and cardiomyopathy in surviving females. In Aim 2, we will evaluate the functional consequences of global and cardiac-specific Pou6f1 deletion using a floxed allele that we have previously obtained. Our approach is innovative because it will challenge and expand the existing paradigm for AVC morphogenesis, a critical step for proper formation of the atrial septum, ventricular septum, and AV valves. This project is significant, therefore, because it will impli- cate an entirely new transcriptional pathway in AVC specification and cardiac morphogenesis. Taken togeth- er, the expected benefits from the proposed studies are to establish a role for Pou6f1 during cardiac morpho- genesis and to obtain key preliminary data for a competitive R01 submission. We anticipate that subsequent follow-up studies will provide a more informed mechanistic understanding of AVC morphogenesis. In turn, such insights promise to expand the list of candidate loci and provide a platform for the rational design of novel treatments for AVSDs."
"9319820","ABSTRACT Genetic and genomic investigations have yielded important findings as to the genetic contributions to major psychiatric illnesses, illustrating significant etiological heterogeneity, as well as cross-disorder overlap. It has also become clear that understanding how this genetic variation leads to alterations in brain development and function that underlies psychiatric disease pathophysiology will be greatly advanced by a roadmap of the transcriptomic and epigenetic landscape of the human cerebral cortex across key developmental windows. Here, we propose, via a highly collaborative group of investigators, each with distinct areas of expertise and research focus, to create a scaffold of genomic data for understanding ASD pathophysiology, and psychiatric disorders more broadly. The work proposed here represents an ambitious multi-PI project (Yale, UCLA, and UCSF) that brings together three principal investigators and collaborators with strong publication records and expertise in all approaches necessary to perform this work using state-of-the-art and novel methodologies. We will perform time-, region-, and cell type-specific molecular profiling of control and ASD brains (Aim 1), including RNA-seq based transcriptomics, identifying cis-regulatory elements via ChIP-seq, and use Hi-C to determine the 3D chromatin architecture and physical relationships that underlie transcriptional regulation in three major regions implicated in neuropsychiatric disease (frontal and temporal cortex and striatum) across five major epochs representing disease-relevant stages in human brain development. This will include complementary genomic analyses in controls and matched post mortem ASD brain to identify genetic mechanisms underlying processes altered in ASD brain. We will address cellular heterogeneity via fluorescence-activated nuclear sorting (FANS) so as to profile neurons and non-neural cells separately, which will complement the whole tissue analyses. We will analyze and integrate these datasets to identify regional, developmental, and ASD-related processes to gain insight into underlying mechanisms, harmonizing these multi-omic data with other psychENCODE studies, as well as other large scale data sets, such as BrainSpan, ENCODE, GTEx and Roadmap Epigenomics Project (Aim 2). We will perform integrated analysis of germ-line ASD variations identified in more than 1000 families from the Simons Simplex Collection to characterize causal enrichments in developmental periods, brain regions, and cell types to better characterize the mechanisms by which genetic variation in humans alters brain development and function in health and disease (Aim 3). Completion of these aims will lead to a well-integrated resource across major periods in human cortical and striatal development that will permit generation of concrete testable hypotheses of ASD mechanisms, and inform our pathophysiological understanding of other related neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9329867","Patients with chronic disease often see a multitude of outpatient providers. For example, Medicare beneficiaries with coronary artery disease each see a median of 10 physicians (3 primary care physicians and 7 specialists) in 6 different practices each year. Seeing more than one physician may be clinically appropriate and indeed may be necessary in order to receive recommended care. However, highly fragmented care increases the risk of gaps in communication across providers. Prior studies suggest that more fragmented care can lead to suboptimal care, with more adverse drug interactions, more testing, more procedures, and lower patient satisfaction, compared to less fragmented care. However, which patients are at greatest risk for healthcare fragmentation and how fragmentation affects patient outcomes are not known. In addition, individuals' experiences of fragmented care are poorly understood, even though understanding individuals' experiences is critical for identifying potential solutions. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the association between healthcare fragmentation and cardiovascular outcomes, by conducting an ancillary study to the REasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS) study. REGARDS is a national, NIH-funded prospective cohort study, which began in 2003 and is ongoing. It includes detailed data on participants' demographic characteristics, co- morbidities, psychosocial variables, and adjudicated myocardial infarction and stroke outcomes. The proposed project will include a subset of 7,120 participants for whom REGARDS data have been linked to Medicare claims at baseline. Fragmentation will be measured from claims, primarily using the Bice-Boxerman Index, a commonly used measure of fragmentation that captures both ?dispersion? (the spread of a patient's care across multiple providers) and ?density? (the relative share of visits by each provider). Fragmentation will also be measured through participant surveys, using a measure previously validated in a Medicare population. The specific aims include determining: 1) which participants are at highest risk of having healthcare fragmentation, 2) associations between claims-based fragmentation and outcomes, and 3) associations between self-reported fragmentation and outcomes. The outcomes of interest include myocardial infarction, stroke, death, emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and healthcare expenditures. This study represents an innovative use of a large cohort to understand the problem of healthcare fragmentation. The research team is highly experienced and multidisciplinary, with national experts in cardiovascular epidemiology and healthcare delivery. Results from the proposed study can be used to inform the design of future interventions to decrease fragmentation and improve outcomes."
"9206077","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Traumatic injuries of the nervous system, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), spinal cord injury (SCI) and traumatic optic neuropathy (TON), are major causes of death and disability in the USA and major challenges for the healthcare of veterans. In addition to the primary injury, secondary injuries, which occur after the primary injury dramatically worsens the damage and cause about 40% of TBI deaths. Because little can be done to reverse the primary injury, the primary aim of the treatment is to prevent secondary injury induced neuronal death. One of the major secondary injuries of TBI, SCI and TON is glutamate excitotoxicity, the pathological process by which neurons are damaged and eventually killed by excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors. Therefore, effectively minimizing or preventing glutamate excitotoxicity will reduce the secondary injury to neurons. In addition, glutamate excitotoxicity also plays critical roles in many other neurodegenerative diseases, such as glaucoma, the leading cause of blindness in the world, including veteran population. Both TON and glaucoma specifically injure retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Because RGCs are the only cells relaying the visual signals from the eyes to the brain, loss of RGCs will result in an irreversible loss of vision and no effective treatments are currently available. Therefore, preventing RGCs from death in TON and glaucoma is crucial to preserve vision. Understanding the mechanisms which control the vulnerability of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity, TON or glaucoma will help us to develop treatment strategies to prevent RGC death in these diseases. Recent studies have shown that immune molecules play important roles in neuron repair and cell death in CNS diseases. In the retina, the receptors of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules, T-cell receptor, (TCR) and their associated proteins are expressed by RGCs. Mutation of these molecules compromised RGC dendrite and axon structure and increased the vulnerability of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity while up-regulated MHCI expression in motor neurons significantly promoted the recovery of locomotor abilities after SCI. These findings strongly support the possibility that MHCI/TCR could protect RGCs from death. In this study, we plan to characterize the vulnerability of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity and optic nerve crush (ONC), investigate the roles of TCR in the regulation of RGC vulnerability, and determine the therapeutic potential of activation of TCR for the prevention of RGC death. The first goal of this study is to determine the contribution of a key molecule of TCR, CD3?, to the vulnerability of RGCs. Our preliminary results showed that different subtypes of RGCs have different vulnerability to glutamate excitotoxicity and RGC vulnerability to glutamate excitotoxicity is dramatically increased in CD3?-/- mice. We will further characterize the vulnerability of four subtypes of RGCs to glutamate excitotoxicity and ONC, and the contribution of CD3??to RGC vulnerability. The second goal is to determine the therapeutic potential of overexpressing CD3? to protect RGCs. Our preliminary results demonstrated that expressing CD3? in RGCs of CD3?-/- retinas restored the RGC dendritic defects, suggesting the reversibility of CD3?-mediated effects on RGCs. We plan to further determine whether the resistance of RGCs can be enhanced by over-expressing the gene encoding CD3?. The third goal of this study is to determine the therapeutic potentials of CD3? activating molecules to protect RGCs. It has been demonstrated that CD3? could be activated by exogenous CD3? activating molecules in vitro. We will further determine if the exogenous CD3??activating molecules work synergistically with the over-expression of CD3? to protect RGCs. Overall, this study will identify the role of MHCI-TCR in the regulation of the vulnerability of RGCs to pathological insults, and test the potential of using     MHCI/TCR mediated mechanisms to protect RGCs from death in diseases. Although RGCs are used as a model in this study, the results could provide important insights into the neuronal death of other areas of CNS and, therefore, have important implications in neuronal protection following traumatic injuries in the CNS."
"9317675","SUMMARY Offspring of women with severe alcohol use disorder (AUD) are at risk for a host of negative outcomes yet data on such high-risk families are sparse. A group of women with typically severe AUD are those with recurrent drunk-driving convictions (rDUI), who come to administrative attention and thus as mothers would be an appropriate group to target for intervention with their children. The proposed study will characterize risk- mechanisms and risk-exposures in these extremely high-risk familes to inform harm-reduction efforts for children and mothers. This will be done by combining analyses of administrative data (birth records, driver?s license records including drunk driving, and residential history information, state social services data, supplemented with census socioeconomic indicators and other neighborhood variables ) (Aims 1a,1b) with collection of pilot self-report data from subsamples of rDUI mothers and matched non-DUI mothers and their 15 year old offspring to obtain data on course of AUD and comorbidity in the mothers, and offspring outcomes, including early risk- taking behaviors and adverse childhood events (Aims 2a,2b). Aims are 1a. To use drivers? license administrative data to identify rDUI and nonDUI mothers, and to test for differences in sociodemographic and reproductive characteristics overall; 1b to use propensity score analysis to identify matched controls for rDUI mothers and to contrast rDUI and matched controls on reproductive outcomes, neighborhood characteristics, state social services data. 2a: In pilot interview data collection, to sample 40 rDUI and 40 propensity-score matched control mothers and their 15 year-old offspring for assessment in order to characterize the course of maternal alcohol involvement, AUD (persistence, remission (abstinent and non- abstinent ), escalation, treatment) and other factors not available in administrative data (relationship instability; own and partner?s illicit drug use and problems; psychiatric disorders including ASPD; health; own trauma and assaultive history; socioeconomic measures; social network) all of which contribute to offspring adverse environments; 2b In pilot web-based assessment with 80 offspring of the rDUI and matched control mothers, to characterize outcomes of early alcohol, tobacco and illicit drug use, and early sex, childhood trauma, and parental separation. Data from this study will be used to inform and design an R01 to study in rDUI mothers and matched control mothers and their adolescent offspring the effect of maternal DUI/AUD on offspring outcomes, environmental adversities experienced by their offspring, and the potential modifying influence of maternal AUD course (treatment, remission/persistence) and social factors on offspring adverse outcomes. Ultimately this would provide the basis for informing a program of harm reduction intervention with these families."
"9272303","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of the proposed research is to understand the role of the voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC1) protein in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis. Recent studies using postmortem AD  brains, brain tissues from 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old AbetaPP transgenic mice, and primary neurons from AbetaPP  and tau mice revealed that age, amyloid beta (Abeta)-, and phosphorylated (phospho) tau-induced mitochondrial  dysfunction and oxidative stress are key factors involved in neuronal dysfunction in AD pathogenesis.  Researchers have reported that Abeta is associated with mitochondria localized at synapses and with synaptic damage and mitochondrial dysfunction. Preliminary research revealed that VDAC1, located in the outer membrane of mitochondria, was higher in the cortical tissues from AD patients and was also higher in the cerebral cortices of the 6-, 12-, and 24-month-old AbetaPP mice. Research also revealed VDAC1 interacting with Abeta and phospho tau in the AD postmortem brains and in the cerebral cortices from APP, APPxPS1, and 3xAD.Tg mice. Mitochondrial functional analysis indicated increased free radicals, lipid peroxidation levels, and fission-linked GTPase activity, and decreased cytochrome oxidase and ATP levels in the APP transgenic mice.  Preliminary research also indicated that Abeta-induced activated glycogen synthase kinase 3beta (GSK3beta) reduced hexokinases 1 and 2, and enhanced VDAC1 phosphorylation, leading to defects in mitochondrial structure/function.  However, the links between Abeta and VDAC1 and between phospho tau and VDAC1 are unclear, and the relationship between GSK3beta and VDAC1 phosphorylation to mitochondrial dysfunction are unclear.  One hypothesis is that Abeta and phospho tau interact with VDAC1, which disrupts the transport of proteins/metabolites, resulting in defects in oxidative phosphorylation and in ATP synthesis. Another hypothesis is that a partial deficiency of VDAC1 maintains the mitochondrial pore activity in neurons producing Abeta and phospho tau, which in turn reduce mitochondrial dysfunction/synaptic damage in AD neurons.  The proposed research objective is to determine the role of VDAC1 in mitochondrial dysfunction in relation to Abeta and phospho tau in AD pathogenesis.  To this end, the proposed specific aims are:  1) to determine the physiological relevance of the interactions between VDAC1 and Abeta, and between VDAC1 and phosphorylated tau in relation to VDAC1 phosphorylation and hexokinase reductions in AD neurons, 2) to determine whether reduced VDAC1 maintains mitochondrial pore activity and mitochondrial function in neurons producing Abeta and 3) phosphorylated tau. The outcomes of the experiments for these aims will provide new insights into the physiological relevance of increased levels of VDAC1 and its interactions with Abeta and phosphorylated tau in AD pathogenesis~ and will provide critical information that can be used to develop  therapies for reducing Abeta- and phosphorylated tau-induced mitochondrial damage and neuronal dysfunction in AD patients."
"9275340","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a hallmark injury to soldiers on the battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan and thus represents a major health issue for veterans returning from these wars. New therapies are urgently needed to prevent brain damage from TBI, improve functional outcomes, and reduce the enhanced risk of dementia associated with TBI. In this application, we propose that NADPH oxidase, a membrane enzyme that generates the highly reactive and damaging free radical superoxide, plays a critical role in cortical and hippocampal damage, cognitive decline, increased risk of dementia, and emotional dysfunction following TBI. We further propose that therapies targeted at inhibiting NADPH oxidase activation, or its key upstream and downstream, mediators will have significant efficacy in the treatment of TBI in veterans. Specific Aim 1 would perform preclinical studies to determine the efficacy of NADPH oxidase inhibitors in exerting neuroprotection and improving functional outcome after TBI. This aim would determine what are the therapeutic window, optimal dose, and optimal NADPH oxidase inhibitor for translation to the clinic. Specific Aim 2 would determine the role of the upstream factors, PTEN and Rac1 in NOX2 NADPH oxidase activation and TBI pathology, and explore their utility as potential novel upstream therapeutic targets in TBI. There are no studies on either Rac1 and PTEN in TBI, and thus the studies are highly novel. Rac1 activation is required for NOX2 activation, and thus targeting it for inhibition could lead to powerful neuroprotection and improved functional outcome in TBI. PTEN is a critical negative regulator of Akt, a well known pro-survival factor. Targeting PTEN for inhibition would thus offer a novel and potentially robust mechanism for enhanced pro-survival signaling following TBI. Specific Aim 3 would establish the role of JNK-Jun signaling in mediating NADPH oxidase-induced pathology following TBI. We propose that NADPH oxidase-induced up-regulation of AD-related proteins and resultant neurodegeneration is achieved via both transcriptional and post- translational mechanisms that are mediated by downstream JNK-Jun signaling. NOX2 knockout mice and NADPH oxidase inhibitor studies will be used to determine the regulatory role of NOX2 on JNK/Jun signaling pathway induction after TBI. JNK inhibition will also be used to determine the role of JNK/Jun signaling in AD-related protein induction, neurodegeneration and functional outcome following TBI. As a whole, the studies will enhance our understanding of the pathological mechanisms underlying TBI, and have the potential to yield important new therapies for TBI."
"9272435","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SCZ) genomics has achieved unprecedented advances. A decade ago, there was perhaps one solid finding, and there are now 130+ loci that meet consensus criteria for significance and replication. The Swedish SCZ Study (S3) and its investigators were centrally important to these advances. Genetic analyses of S3 samples have been major parts of multiple high profile papers. We cooperate well with other groups, and are leaders in the PGC. There is more to do. Thus, this is a competitive renewal for the S3 project. The S3 is arguably the largest and best-characterized SCZ sample anywhere: we propose to make it larger and more informative. In each prior R01, we accomplished far more than we proposed. We now propose aims designed to maximize the informativeness of S3 by doubling its size, adding cognitive phenotypes, and innovative analyses. Critically, this work is multi-funded and maximizes contributions from others and minimizes NIH budgetary requests. Specific Aims (1) Augment S3 dataset by doubling the sample size, add cognitive phenotypes, conduct comprehensive genomic characterization, impute to a Sweden-specific reference panel, and add new Swedish register linkages. Output: a large and comprehensive dataset ready for analysis. (2) Analysis: increase knowledge of the genetic basis of SCZ. Integrate data from Aim 1 with all other world samples to discover compellingly associated loci. Add multi-omic integration: combine, annotate, and rigorously evaluate results with all available epigenomic and gene expression data (e.g., CommonMind, psychENCODE). Output: SCZ associations across the allelic spectrum, specific hypotheses about the immediate biological impact of genetic variation implicated in SCZ. Successful completion of this work - capitalizing on cutting-edge technologies and a highly productive decade- long collaboration - is highly likely to advance knowledge of SCZ by identifying more loci, providing specific biological hypotheses, and understanding of GxE action and interaction. This study is preclinical. Although not proposed here due to complexity and expense, we will immediate prioritize any potential therapeutic target via collaborations (e.g., with Dr Sullivan's UNC colleague and antipsychotic expert Dr Bryan Roth). The work proposed is highly efficient / cost-effective due to our multi-funding model. We have minimized costs (while maximizing the science we can achieve) via multiple strategic partnerships. We use consultancies to bring well-funded investigators into S3. We routinely use multiple technologies to enhance collaboration."
"9473991","Abstract The goal of this project is to utilize cytomegalovirus (CMV) vectors to develop a therapeutic vaccine against Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. Although the most common transmission route is by a triatomine bug vector known as the ?kissing bug?, Chagas disease is also spread vertically from mother to child and along blood born routes such as organ transplant and transfusion. While the acute phase of infection may last a couple of months, it is generally asymptomatic and self-limiting. However, chronic parasite persistence in 30 ? 40% of patients can give rise to severe cardiac and gastrointestinal disorders presumed to be a result of an inadequate host immune response. Severe long-term chronic disease can lead to cardiac manifestations such as arrhythmias, aneurysms, thromboembolic events, and heart failure resulting in sudden death. Current efforts to control disease is focused on the use of anti-trypanosomal drugs which are contraindicated in pregnancy, advanced kidney or liver disease, and are of questionable efficacy for those who can tolerate treatment. An effective therapeutic vaccine has the potential to ameliorate the complications of the estimated 40,000 new cases of Chagas and prevent 10,000 or more deaths annually. Vaccine studies indicate protective immune responses are linked to T. cruzi specific CD8 T-cell induction. CMV vectors are uniquely qualified for this task due to their ability to induce lifelong, high frequency effector memory T cell (TEM) responses. The TEM cell population is maintained by persistent, low level antigen presentation. In non-human primate models, TEM induced by CMV-vectored vaccines have functionally cured SIV. CMV-vectors are currently being developed for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines against HIV by TomegaVax, Inc. Unlike traditional viral vectors, CMV vectors can be used repeatedly, without loss of immunogenicity or efficacy. Importantly, spread-deficient CMV vectors maintain the same level of TEM stimulation as wild-type vectors, providing safety for immunocompromised recipients. The feasibility of CMV vectors for Chagas, will be evaluated in murine CMV vectors expressing T. cruzi antigens in a well-established murine model. Using bacterial artificial chromosome technology, we will construct CMV vectors expressing selected antigens, characterize the induced immune responses, and determine their prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy against challenge with T. cruzi. This phase I study will enable the selection of protective antigens for insertion into spread-deficient human CMV vectors. Phase II of this program will then focus on IND-enabling studies to manufacture and test HCMV-vectored Chagas vaccines. The ultimate product of this research program will be a recombinant therapeutic vaccine providing lifelong protection."
"9237639","Project Summary Animal and human studies suggest that elevation of neuroactive steroids may address many of the behavioral pathologies associated with alcohol use disorders. The goal of this project is to evaluate the hypotheses that elevated steroidogenesis in the ventral tegmental area will reduce operant ethanol self-administration and the escalation of voluntary drinking following deprivation in male and female alcohol preferring (P) rats. Endogenous neuroactive steroids will be elevated by viral vector-mediated gene delivery of the biosynthetic enzyme P450scc that converts cholesterol to pregnenolone. Our recent studies demonstrate that vector-mediated delivery of P450scc to the VTA reduces ethanol self-administration and increases local expression of (3?,5?)-3-hydroxypregnan-20-one (3?,5?-THP, allopregnanolone) (Cook et al., 2014). We now propose to extend these studies by examining effects in both male and female P rats, probing effects on deprivation-induced drinking and targeting the vector to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) neurons in the VTA. We will examine vector and behavioral specificity as well as the persistence of effects. Aim 1 will investigate if elevation of steroidogenesis by gene delivery of P450scc to VTA alters A) operant ethanol self-administration in non?dependent male and female P rats or B) deprivation-induced drinking in ethanol dependent male and female P rats. Aim 2 will examine whether TH neuron-specific elevation of steroidogenesis in VTA alters A) operant ethanol self-administration in non?dependent male and female rats or B) deprivation-induced drinking in ethanol dependent male and female P rats. These studies will increase our understanding of the role of VTA neuroactive steroids in ethanol reinforcement, anxiety-like behavior and escalated drinking following ethanol deprivation."
"9281534","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Many VA patients are susceptible and succumb to infections with the opportunistic pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa. This can occur as a complication of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, cancer and immunosuppressive drug therapy. Exposure to this ubiquitous bacterium can result in nosocomial infections, which are common via respiratory ventilators, catheters, lumbar punctures and general surgery. P. aeruginosa is highly tolerant or resistant to most antibiotics, making it difficult to control such infections, which leads to a high mortality rate. The goal of tis research is to improve our understanding of the biosynthesis of a protective capsule-like polysaccharide called alginate, which is produced as a virulence factor by P. aeruginosa. During chronic respiratory infections (e.g., COPD), adaptive mutations occur in vivo that lead to the over production of this exopolysaccharide, which confers resistance to phagocytic killing. Such clinical isolates demonstrate mucoid colony morphology. Improving our understanding of this pathogenic mechanism in P. aeruginosa will enhance the management of pulmonary disease caused by this bacterium. Most of the enzymes for the production of alginate are clustered in an operon of 12 genes. In this study, we will: (1) Determine the role of the second messenger cyclic di-GMP in the polymerization of alginate, (2) Characterize the role of the membrane fusion protein (MFP) domain in Alg44, and (3) Characterize the protein-protein interactions among the alginate secretion proteins. In addition, as part of a drug discovery plan, we will (4) screen smal compound libraries for those that antagonize the acetylation of alginate, which is required for resistance to phagocytosis. In collaboration with a structural biologist, we will determine the structures of all the alginate biosynthetic proteins, which will lead to the analysis of site-direced mutants to better understand the polymerization-secretion complex. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the functions of all of the components required for the biosynthesis of alginate, which is now recognized as a critical virulence factor during pulmonary infection. The information gained could be vital for the development of new therapeutic approaches in the treatment of P. aeruginosa infections. The results of these studies will also contribute to our overall understanding of bacterial capsule biosynthesis, which is a common mechanism of bacterial virulence for avoiding the host immune response."
"9301577","DATA SCIENCE RESEARCH  BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE  Biology in the 21st century has emerged as a big data science on par with physics or astronomy. Beginning with the landmark sequencing projects over a decade ago [1, 2], there have been successive waves of technological breakthroughs in probing cellular information on a genome-wide scale: microarrays [3], next generation sequencing [4], large-scale proteomics [5] and their many derivatives [6, 7]. Quick and widespread adoption of high throughput technologies has created massive amounts of data, yet there is a consensus that  the floodgates have only barely opened [8]. The explosive growth of data volume has fostered intense research in the development of informatics tools to store, manage and analyze such data [9]. However, the scale and efficiency of the analysis is lagging behind the generation of data, a fact recognized by the major national funding agencies, with the result that the true potential of the data to accelerate biological discovery is not being realized.    Analysis of biological data today is hampered by two major bottlenecks: (1) Integration: Different  biotechnological tools record different kinds of cellular activities that provide complementary views of the same underlying biological phenomena. However, it has proved extremely difficult to integrate those partial descriptions into a well-organized whole, even though the advantages of such an integrative analysis of diverse data types are well recognized [10]. (2) Scalability: The challenge of data integration is generally met with the most heavy-duty machine learning techniques of the day [10], which typically do not scale well with data size. Biology needs analysis tools that can handle the data deluge of its modern omics era. We propose  to develop an E-science framework that will address the issues of integrative analysis and scalability associated with big data analysis in biology. We will build this environment from the ground up, laying its algorithmic foundations, engineering the scalable systems that form its skeleton frame, and creating the human-computer interface that makes it hospitable."
"9352458","PROJECT SUMMARY Myocardial regenerative therapy is poised to revolutionize the way heart failure is treated, but further improvements and enhanced products are needed to make this therapy truly safe and efficacious. Our company, CardioCreate, Inc., has pioneered the use of genetic engineering to enhance the regenerative potential of human Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CPCs) intended for autologous therapeutic utilization. CPCs support myocardial repair and improve cardiac performance through reduction of scar size and increased cardiac output. Pim-1, an endogenous constitutively activated enzyme found within CPCs, is produced in response to stress or pathologic injury in the myocardium. Pim-1 up-regulation enhances cell survival through mediating transcription, cell growth, proliferation, survival, and expansion of the CPC pool. Our legacy of over a decade of research on Pim-1 biology culminates with demonstration of remarkable regenerative effects mediated by adoptively transferred human Pim-1 enhanced CPCs in rodent and swine models with significantly improved cardiac performance relative to unmodified CPCs, bone marrow stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. Our studies with human Pim-1 enhanced CPCs have also demonstrated the reversal of aging affects on human CPCs, such as down regulation of senescence markers, increased telomere length and mitochondrial activity and the enhancement of proliferation. The technology of using autologous Pim-1 enhanced Cardiac Progenitor Cells (CardioEnhancers?) represents a novel and efficacious treatment for heart failure, leading to improved health, longevity and wellbeing of our society. CardioEnhancers? have the potential to provide a potential treatment and cure for cardiovascular disease, most specifically heart failure, which is the leading cause of death in the United States and equally affects men and women of all ethnicities and races. This proposal represents the convergent evolution of a decade of high-level mechanistic biological research coupled with entrepreneurial implementation of regenerative medicine solutions moving from the laboratory toward clinical setting implementation. In this Phase 1 STTR proposal the focus will be to complete initial in vitro safety profiling through a combination of oncogenicity and genotoxicity assessments necessary for FDA mandated IND approval. The Phase I goal is to generate the first battery of test results requested by the FDA to evaluate the safety profile of CardioEnhancers?. The innovation of this STTR rests in the trajectory toward implementation of next-generation stem cell therapy for treatment of heart failure. The significance of this STTR will allow CardioCreate, Inc. to move forward as a small business towards the objectives of finding an effective and safe therapeutic treatment for heart disease that may be used internationally, providing highly- skilled manufacturing jobs to US citizens and advancing the high-tech scientific achievement for our US research community."

"9456392","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Small, free-living amoebae (FLA) are ubiquitous in nature and are found in soil, fresh water, and marine environments. Most of the FLA feed on bacteria and are of no medical importance, yet several genera and species of FLA are known to causes serious, usually fatal disease in humans and animals. Naegleria fowleri and Acanthamoeba spp. are the best known examples of pathogenic FLA. N. fowleri thrives in warm, freshwater and is the causative agent of primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (PAM). This disease is characterized by a fulminant, rapidly fatal encephalitic disease that most often afflicts healthy young humans. Acanthamoeba spp. are more ubiquitous and found in water (fresh and saline) and soil. Multiple species of Acanthamoeba are known to cause granulomatous amoebic encepahalitis (GAE), a chronic disease seen most often in immunocompromised hosts and those at risk of opportunistic infections. Acanthamoeba spp. also causes amoebic keratitis, skin, nasopharyngeal, and disseminated infections. The major problem for infections with any of the pathogenic FLA is the lack of effective therapeutics. PAM and GAE are usually fatal diseases, even if the infection is diagnosed promptly and treated with the best available drug regimens. Despite the severity of infections caused by FLA, there are few data available on new drugs and no concerted modern drug discovery or development efforts. The majority of the research literature on drug discovery for FLA consists of limited in vitro or in vivo studies with drugs already approved for other uses. The major goals of this project are to discover and develop and to late lead ? one new drug to treat central nervous system infections with pathogenic FLA. We have conducted structure activity studies with a series of amidino related compounds (>160) and identified two chemotypes for further development. In the R21 phase, we propose to conduct additional lead optimization to develop early lead candidates by the end of the R21 phase. Candidates will be prioritized based upon in vitro potency, physiochemical properties, and rate-of-killing in a novel dual cell viability assay.In the R33 phase we will further optimize for potency in vivo and enhancement of PK and ADME properties and conduct safety toxicology studies with the best late lead candidates. Our ultimate goal for this project is to identify one novel amidino related compound that can be used in combination with other drugs for the treatment of pathogenic FLA infections of the central nervous system."
"9286515","The purpose of this project is to develop computational and brain-based models of emotion cue integration: people?s inferences about others? emotions based on dynamic, multimodal cues. Observers often decide how targets feel based on cues such as facial expressions, prosody, and language. Such inferences scaffold healthy social interaction, and abnormal inference both marks and exacerbates social deficits in numerous psychiatric disorders. Psychologists and neuroscientists have studied emotion inference for decades, but the vast majority of this work employs simplified social cues, such as vignettes or static images of faces. By contrast, ?real world? emotion cues are complex, dynamic, and multimodal. Cue integration?inference based on naturalistic emotion information?likely differs from simpler inference at cognitive and neural levels, but this phenomenon remains poorly understood. This means that scientists lack a clear model of how observers adaptively process complex emotion cues, and how that processing goes awry in mental illness. Especially lacking are mechanistic models that can describe the computations and brain processes involved in cue integration with sufficient precision to predict inference in new cases, observers, and samples. This project will merge tools from social psychology, computer science, and neuroscience to generate a novel and rigorous model of emotion cue integration. We have demonstrated that in the face of complex emotion cues, observers dynamically ?weight? cues from each modality (e.g., visual, linguistic) over time, a process that (i) tracks shifts in brain activity and connectivity; and (ii) can be captured using Bayesian models. Here, we will expand this work in several ways. First, we will develop precise computational tools to isolate features of emotion cues?such as facial movements, prosody, and linguistic sentiment?that track observers? use of each cue modality during integration. Second, we will develop multi-region ?signatures? of brain activity and connectivity that track emotion inference in each modality. We will use these signatures in conjunction with machine learning to predict unimodal emotion inference and cue integration in new observers and samples, based on brain data alone. Third, we will explore the context-dependence of naturalistic emotion inference by testing whether reinforcement learning can bias observers? cue integration and accompanying brain signatures. Finally, we will model computational and neural abnormalities associated with cue integration in patients with Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder. At the level of basic science, these data will generate a fundamentally new?and more naturalistic?approach to the neuroscience of emotion inference. The computational and brain metrics we produce will also be made publically available to facilitate the open and cumulative study of emotion inference across labs. At a translational level, we will provide a mechanistic, rich account of abnormal emotion inference in mood disorders, paving the way for computational and brain markers that can be used to assess social dysfunction and treatment efficacy in these and other mental illnesses."
"9326118","GEMSSTAR R03 Abstract Frailty is the occurrence of decreased reserve and functional decline with resultant vulnerability and poor outcomes in recovery from a stressor usually in older patients. Although frailty is distinct from age, it is highly correlated, and as the US population ages, the prevalence of frailty will likely increase. The growing prevalence of older patient population and frailty will place greater demands on surgical services. One third of all patients aged 65-85 will undergo a major surgical procedure within the last year of life. To provide the best quality of care, it is imperative that healthcare providers and hospitals develop strategies to meet these growing demands and to ensure higher-quality care for geriatric surgical patients. Recent data demonstrate that frailty is a powerful predictor of increased perioperative mortality, morbidity and cost in various surgical populations. Failure to rescue (FTR) refers to a failure to prevent death from treatable complications during hospitalization (e.g. major hemorrhage after surgery) and is used a metric for hospital quality. Our study aims to show that frailty impacts failure to rescue independent of other hospital factors. We also think that certain hospitals are better at rescuing frail patients and we aim to identify characteristics of such hospitals. Although intuitive, this association has not been studied so far. This will be the first study to examine the interplay of frailty, which is primarily a patient characteristic, and FTR- a quality indicator believed to hospital dependent. The proposal also entails a detailed professional development plan with training that will be essential both for successful completion of this research and toward Dr. Arya's career development and transition to aging and surgical quality research. Significant findings from this study will change the way failure to rescue research is used for hospital quality and will lay the groundwork for development of new interventions or protocols on a patient as well as hospital level to improve surgical outcomes in frail patients."
"9275382","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The Leishmania species protozoa cause a spectrum of human diseases, the most severe of which is visceral leishmaniasis (VL). VL is a potentially fatal disease in which parasites disseminate throughout reticuloendothelial organs of the host, causing a chronic wasting syndrome with profound suppression of host immune responses. After being deposited in human dermis by the sand fly vector, the promastigote form of the parasite is taken up through phagocytosis by host cells of myeloid origin, where it transforms to the obligate intracellular amastigote form. Throughout chronic infection, parasites survive as obligate intracellular parasites primarily in tissue macrophages.  It was long believed that Leishmania reside exclusively in cells of monocytic origin throughout infection of the mammalian host. It is now apparent that parasites infect other myeloid cell types. Neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes are the first cells to arrive at the infection site and internalize Leishmania. Preliminary studiesin this application demonstrate that Lic continue to recruit myeloid cells to the infection site throughout chronic progressive infection. Heterogeneous populations of immature myeloid cells with suppressive functions, called Myeloid Derived Suppressor Cells or MDSCs, have been shown to suppress adaptive immune responses and modulate macrophage phenotype in models of cancer or transplantation. We propose herein to examine that hypothesis that myeloid cells infiltrating the sites of disseminated Lic infection have a suppressive phenotype.  The NLR proteins are cytosolic proteins that respond to either pathogen-associated or danger- associated molecular patterns. Some of the NLR proteins activate the multi-protein inflammasome complex, resulting in activation of caspase-1, release of IL-1? and IL-18, and a potent inflammatory response. The non-inflammasome forming NLR proteins also affect host defenses through varied mechanisms, many of which are yet ill-defined. We hypothesize that myeloid cells infiltrating the sites of parasite dissemination are responsible in part for the immunosuppression of chronic VL, and that NLRs are critical determinants of myeloid cell function during Lic infection. We propose to investigate the following aims. AIM #1. Identify myeloid cells infiltratin the sites of Lic localization throughout infection. Hypothesis: Mature neutrophils and inflammatory monocytes infiltrate the site of parasite inoculation during acute infection, whereas granulocytic and monocytic myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) localize to the sites of parasite dissemination once chronic infection is established. AIM #2. Determine whether NLR proteins exacerbate or ameliorate the course of visceral leishmaniasis in murine models. Hypothesis: Nlrp10 is essential for recruitment of myeloid cells, whereas Nlrp12 is required for the development of a protective type 1 immune response."
"9272437","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Obesity is a profound public health issue and an even more alarming problem for patients with schizophrenia, who are obese at rates twice those observed in the general population. The use of certain neuroleptics to treat the symptoms of schizophrenia contributes greatly to weight gain in the illness. Olanzapine and clozapine, for example, can result in substantial weight gain while neuroleptics such as risperidone appear to cause modest weight gain. There is a relatively rich understanding of the molecular mechanisms of these drugs, yet the processes by which they cause metabolic side effects such as obesity are unknown. While imaging studies by our group and others have begun to improve our understanding of the neuronal processes involved in food intake behavior related to obesity in the general population, these mechanisms have not yet been studied in patients with schizophrenia. The overall goals of this proposal are to improve our understanding of the neuronal mechanisms by which neuroleptics contribute to obesity in schizophrenia and to determine whether an intervention such as exercise causes changes in neuronal response that would predict improved regulation of food intake behavior in schizophrenia. These goals will be addressed with two aims. First, we will determine (a) whether neuronal responses to a meal are altered and are related to food intake behaviors in obese compared to lean patients with schizophrenia and (b) whether neuroleptics that cause the most weight gain in patients are associated with greater alterations in neuronal responses related to food intake behavior compared to those associated with less weight gain. Second, this project will determine if a 12-week exercise intervention, as compared to diet, improves function of brain networks associated with food intake behavior in patients with schizophrenia. Understanding the potential mechanisms of dysregulated or altered food intake in patients with schizophrenia and the effect of neuroleptics will have a significant impact on the field and will elucidate possible mechanisms to help develop better, targeted therapeutic interventions for this population. These goals are in line with both the NIMH Strategic Objective to develop better interventions that incorporate the diverse needs of people with mental illnesses, and the Strategic Plan for NIH Obesity Research, which aims to develop more effective approaches to address the tremendous burden of obesity."
"9391884","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy."

"9353713","Abstract: The goal of this proposal is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms governing BubR1 protein abundance and function, and its role in the regulation of tumorigenesis and aging. Aging is the single greatest risk factor for cancer development, yet the mechanistic basis driving this interrelationship remains largely undefined. BubR1, a serine/threonine protein kinase, is involved in the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) to ensure faithful chromosome segregation during mitosis, and therefore is intimately linked to genomic integrity and cancer. Interestingly, recent studies have implicated BubR1 in the aging process where BubR1 abundance has been shown to decline in a variety of tissues as mammals age. Mice engineered to express low levels of BubR1 from birth die within a year, exhibiting increased senescence, premature aging phenotypes and an increased susceptibility to cancer, whereas mice overexpressing BubR1 have an extended lifespan with reduction in age- related diseases and cancer development. Senescence is believed to be largely tumor-suppressive and prevent cancer in young individuals. However, in aged individuals senescent cells can contribute to age-related cancer development. Therefore, BubR1 may play a pivotal role in the interrelationship between aging and cancer given that BubR1 suppresses both senescence and tumorigenesis. Previously, we identified an acetylation-dependent mechanism regulating BubR1 protein stability, where SIRT2 prevents degradation of BubR1 through deacetylation, leading to lifespan extension of a BubR1 premature aging mouse model. Furthermore, BubR1 protein levels in aged animals can be restored to youthful levels by stimulating SIRT2 activity through induction of NAD+ levels. These results suggest that the age-related decline in BubR1 levels can be reversed, potentially alleviating age-related diseases including cancer. Therefore, we hypothesize that BubR1 is a key tumor suppressor, and its loss with age increases cancer susceptibility. In this proposal, we plan to: 1) elucidate the physiological role of BubR1 post translational modifications during aging and calorie restriction and their impact on mitotic progression and tumorigenesis; and 2) determine the mechanisms regulating BubR1 protein abundance and function during aging. These studies will elucidate how regulation of BubR1 by post-translational modifications controls mitotic progression and tumorigenesis during aging as well as to identify mechanisms through which BubR1 declines with age and controls the aging processes. Given that aging poses the largest single risk factor for developing cancer, elucidating the molecular details governing the physiological role of BubR1 in cancer and aging will provide mechanistic understanding of the interrelationship between aging and cancer development, as well as identify possible therapeutic strategies to treat age-related diseases."
"9305278","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In this renewal, we hypothesize that type of menopause and associated hormone changes relate to cognitive responsiveness to hormone therapy (HT). The initial grant used rats to assess variations in HTs with surgical menopause (Ovx), and transitional menopause using 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD). VCD-treated rats undergo ovarian failure; follicles and estrogens deplete, androgens become unopposed, and gonadotropins increase, a profile resembling transitionally menopausal women. Data from the initial grant lay the foundation for testing new hypotheses regarding transitional versus surgical menopause. In women, both transitional and surgical menopause have been related to memory changes. However, most rodent studies have tested cognitive effects after Ovx. Despite insight rat models yield regarding surgical hormone loss, surgical menopause models <13% of women. Here, we examine how different menopause types impact cognitive and brain aging, and aim to determine optimal parameters for the menopause transition and HT. Four aims are proposed, using rats: Aim 1) We found that androstenedione (Andro) relates to impaired memory. Since Andro is directly converted to estrone, and we have shown estrone-induced memory impairments, we hypothesize that Andro's conversion to estrone impairs memory. Aim 1 tests whether Andro's conversion to estrogens, or androgen receptor stimulation, underlies its cognitive detriments. Aim 2) Clinical studies support a critical window during which HT benefits cognition. Rat studies support this; however, these studies used Ovx rats, and gave only 17?-estradiol (E2). E2 is naturally-occurring in women and rats, but is present only in trace amounts in conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) HT. In rats, we found that CEE enhanced memory after surgical menopause, but impaired memory after transitional menopause when given after follicle depletion. Aim 2 tests cognitive change during and after different types of menopause, and whether giving CEE before or during follicular depletion impairs memory, as compared to E2. Aim 3) We found that the HT progestin medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA) impaired cognition in Ovx rats, and decreased hippocampal glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) protein, possibly compensating for GABAA receptor (GABAAR) stimulation. Another progestin, norethindrone acetate (NETA), enhanced memory in Ovx rats. We hypothesize that NETA antagonizes the GABAAR, reducing GABAAR-mediated inhibition, enhancing memory. Aim 3 will determine whether the GABAergic system underlies MPA- and NETA-induced memory changes. Aim 4).  This aim tests whether MPA or NETA impacts the effects of CEE or E2. MPA was chosen for this aim to test the HT Prempro (CEE+MPA); NETA was chosen due to its potential to be part of a novel combination HT, as it is used in contraceptives and it enhanced rat cognition. In each study, we will quantify GAD and cholinergic markers, each previously shown to relate to cognition, in brains of cognitively characterized rats. Multiple regression and growth modeling will test relations between the GABAergic system, cholinergic system, hormone levels, and cognition in both menopause models. This work will yield insight into cognitive effects of the menopause transition, variations in menopause type and HTs, and related mechanisms."
"9281535","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The sodium chloride co-transporter (NCC) and the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) are two key sodium transporting proteins in the distal tubule of the mammalian kidney. Hyperactivity of either protein results in hypertension and hypoactivity results in hypotension. These two proteins are co-expressed in the second part of the distal convoluted tubule (DCT2) and are regulated by many of the same proteins. However, associations between the two have not been investigated. Preliminary data indicates that the proteins associate in a sodium transporting complex and co-localize in the apical membrane of the DCT2. Investigating the relationship between ENaC and NCC in this key nephron segment has the potential to significantly alter our understanding of salt transport in the mammalian kidney. We now propose to examine the interaction of NCC with each subunit of ENaC, examine the functional implications of this interaction and investigate association-dependent alterations in regulation of these proteins by aldosterone.  Co-localization (in vivo and in vitro), native association, and proximity of NCC and each ENaC subunit will be examined. The ENaC subunit(s) that are critical for binding to NCC will also be determined. These studies will define the association between NCC and each ENaC subunit. Then the impact of this association on function, protein expression, surface expression and response to inhibitors of both sodium transporters will be investigated. These studies will determine the functional implications of this interaction. Then aldosterone-induced changes in function, protein expression and surface expression of NCC and ENaC will be examined in the absence or presence of the other. The aldosterone-induced phosphorylation of NCC with and without ENaC will also be investigated. Additionally the association of NEDD4-2 with NCC in the absence and presence of ENaC subunits will be determined. These studies will determine whether the NCC alters the regulation of ENaC by aldosterone and whether any of the ENaC subunits alter the regulation of NCC by aldosterone.  A variety of methods will be utilized to address these issues. Function of NCC will be assessed by thiazide-sensitive 22Na+ uptakes in mouse distal convoluted tubule cells (mDCT15). For measurement of ENaC function, Dr. Doug Eaton's lab will use single channel whole-cell patch clamping to assess ENaC function. The proximity of these proteins will be assessed utilizing Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET). Signal will be detected with confocal microscopy. Native association will be examined through the use of Blue Native PAGE. Electron Microscopy will be used to examine association under aldosterone stimulation. Lentiviral shRNA transduction particles will be used to knockdown protein expression in mDCT15 cells. Small animal surgeries with implantation of osmotic minipumps will be used to examine the effects of aldosterone on the NCC-ENaC association on the organismal level. Additionally standard methodologies such as immunoblotting, SDS-PAGE, biotinylation, transfection, co- immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry will be used."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement, the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation (DAIT) intends to consolidate its funding for multiple, independent Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Centers (SACCCs) into a single multi-component cooperative agreement, presumably to reduce costs and increase efficiency and standardization across research consortia. This new program will fund a single SACCC, or Center, to support DAIT research in the areas of asthma and allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, and transplantation. Because Rho is currently the SACCC for many of these consortia and these SACCCs already share some resources and processes, Rho is well suited to provide consolidated support.             The objective of the Center is to provide excellent and efficient coordination of the following services: protocol development, study initiation and management, statistical design and analysis, clinical site monitoring, ancillary services, data management, safety oversight, and bioinformatics. To accomplish these objectives, Rho aims to (1) provide staff experienced in research conducted by DAIT-supported consortia and to organize these staff in an administrative structure that manages resources efficiently, is responsive to the needs of the research consortia and DAIT, and facilitates communication and collaboration; (2) provide experienced scientists and statisticians who, in collaboration with clinical investigators and DAIT officials, design and analyze studies across the full scope of research; (3) facilitate the development, review, and revision of initial and successive drafts of protocols and protocol-related documents through dedicated protocol teams; (4) provide study initiation and study management functions that are required for the efficient, valid, and ethical conduct of studies; (5) provide high-quality and well-developed procedures and personnel for the monitoring of clinical sites; (6) provide the efficient and accurate tracking and reconciliation of specimen collection and distribution; (7) provide high-quality, integrated, and secure information management systems and procedures for the collection of clinical and mechanistic data; (8) help ensure patient safety by providing high-quality serious adverse event (SAE) reporting and Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) reports; and (9) provide tools, infrastructure, and analytical support in the planning, implementation, analysis, and dissemination of high dimensional mechanistic studies.             Based on our substantial experience coordinating all aspects of clinical research, we plan to use our current technology infrastructure, combined with new and innovative techniques to: streamline and automate processes; provide easy access to data for DAIT, clinical investigators, and other key research stakeholders; allow for flexibility of Center staffing and resource sharing; standardize processes and methodologies across disease groups and centralized groups; and continue to provide the flexibility necessity to meet the changing demands of this dynamic research program."
"9267401","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have recently identified variants at 22 genomic loci associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) susceptibility. Similar to other common, complex genetic disorders, AD is characterized by substantial locus heterogeneity and polygenic susceptibility. The critical next steps include understanding gene mechanisms and elucidating the genetic interactions that define functional pathways mediating AD risk. We have developed a successful cross-species validation strategy that links emerging susceptibility candidates to functional dissection of genes and pathways in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Our studies to date of candidate genes from AD GWAS implicate a susceptibility network comprised of CD2AP and related mediators of cell adhesion, including CASS4, FERMT2, and PTK2B, and endocytosis, including PICALM, BIN1, AP-2?, and RIN3. The encoded proteins recapitulate a putative interaction network, supporting their coordinate function in nervous system health and disease. In preliminary studies, we further show that CD2AP, similar to other network candidates, localizes to the synapse, associates with synaptic vesicle proteins, and loss-of-function both impairs synaptic plasticity and enhances the neurotoxicity of Tau, which forms neurofibrillary tangle pathology characteristic of AD. The overall goal of this proposal is to extend our understanding of the genes and functional interactions that define the CD2AP susceptibility network and its contribution to AD pathogenesis. We hypothesize that dysfunction within the CD2AP regulatory pathway attenuates synaptic efficacy, and leads to enhanced vulnerability to Tau- induced neuronal injury in AD. We will first (AIM 1) exploit the rapid and powerful genetics available in flies for systematic functional dissection of conserved genes implicated in the CD2AP susceptibility network including epistatic mapping of pathway interactions. Next (AIM 2), we will employ mouse models to further elucidate the role of CD2AP at mammalian synapses and in Tau-mediated neurodegeneration. Lastly (AIM 3), for translation of our findings, the animal model studies will be coupled with analyses in human cohorts, examining regulatory changes in transcripts and proteins in relation to age-related synaptic loss, AD neuropathologic burden, and resulting cognitive impairment. IMPACT: By integrating emerging human genomic data with functional investigation in flies, mice and human brains, we will elucidate the CD2AP susceptibility network and define its role in synaptic health, Tau pathology, and AD risk, delivering a rich portfolio of preclinical data to support new therapeutic targets."
"9275374","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Pituitary tumors are the most common brain tumor, found at autopsy in up to 20% of our population and clinically in 1/10,000 persons. With the current number of US veterans, this translates into over 225,000 veterans with pituitary tumors. Gonadotrope (or null cell) tumors occur more commonly in men who present clinically with erectile dysfunction, hormone deficiencies, headaches and visual disturbances progressing to blindness. Many of these tumors are invasive and recur. There are no available medical therapies for these large pituitary tumors and surgery remains the treatment of choice. The genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying pituitary tumorigenesis are poorly understood. We have amassed a unique bank of >300 human pituitary tumor and 100 normal pituitary samples tied to a clinical database. We performed a combined genetic screen to identify copy number alternations together with genomic transcriptome profiling using microarrays. Amplification of the MST4 gene, a Sterile 20-like germinal center kinase (GCK) III subfamily member was detected in an aggressive gonadotrope pituitary tumor together with increased MST4 transcript and protein levels in all pituitary tumors. Extensive new preliminary data demonstrate the role of MST4 driving proliferation and survival in response to oxidative stress and hypoxia to promote tumorigenesis. In this revised Merit Review we propose:  Aim 1: To determine the frequency of altered copy number, translocation or mutation in the MST4 kinase as a mechanism contributing to human pituitary tumor pathogenesis. These experiments will define the mechanism of MST4 dysregulation in human pituitary tumors.  Aim 2: To examine the importance of the kinase domain of MST4 to mediate its effects on proliferation and survival and confirm or refute the role of MST4 to mediate tumor growth in a preclinical mouse model. Studies using gonadotrope and growth hormone pituitary cells based systems will dissect the critical regions of MST4 to mediate tumorigenesis using read outs of proliferation, survival in response to oxidative stress or hypoxia and clonagenic assays. Results will be confirmed in a preclinical ex vivo nude mouse model to confirm the ability to MST4 to promote tumorigenesis in vivo.  Aim 3: To identify small molecules with the capacity to inhibit MST4 activity and establish the structural characteristics necessary for selective MST4 inhibition. Library screening of known compounds together with in silico computer screening will identify known or design new candidate MST4 kinase inhibitors that will be tested in the cell and animal models as proof of concept for our ultimate goal of targeting MST4 in human pituitary tumors. Together these studies will use cutting edge genetic and genomic approaches together with mechanistic studies to dissect the role of dysregulation of MST4 in human pituitary tumors. These studies will shed light into the pathobiology of pituitary tumors. Targeting of the MST4 kinase may provide novel medical treatment strategies for our patients with pituitary tumors and other malignancies where MST4 is dysregulated."

"9246578","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Degeneration of the cerebellum causes ataxia, a disorder of balance and coordination which can be severely disabling and render afflicted individuals unable to walk, speak, or make coordinated movements. Genetic ataxia affects half a million people worldwide, but current testing only identifies roughly 50% of the responsible genes. Better diagnosis will lead to better treatment and uncovering novel disease genes could provide new insight into the workings of the cerebellum and suggest ways to combat its degeneration. New technology, termed next-generation sequencing, is a cost-effective means of examining either the entire human genome or the key portion that codes for protein, known as the exome, and can be used to comprehensively investigate patients for novel genetic mutations. The UCLA Ataxia and Neurogenetics Program possesses a unique resource for studying this genetic variation with a large bank of DNA samples from hundreds of individuals and families with cerebellar ataxia, all with precisely detailed clinical information.  1) We will examine the exomes of 20 ataxic families with dominant (10) or recessive (10) inheritance, all screened negative for the most common known genetic ataxias. We will initially confirm probands possess no variants in rare (<1% worldwide) ataxia genes and then proceed to identifying novel causative variants. We have developed a pipeline for excluding benign polymorphisms and isolating only those variants with the highest probability of causing neurologic disease. For patients and families remaining unidentified following this analysis, we will examine their genomes for disease-causing variants potentially altering gene expression and/or regulation. We will estimate the occurrence of mutations in genes we discover within our ataxia patient population and confirm that they are not found in normal individuals.  2) Although examination of families is essential to the identification of new disease genes, the majority of undiagnosed patients seen in ataxia clinics lack a clearly defined family history of disease. To address these individuals, we will examine subgroups of patients with similar detailed clinical presentations as they will be most likely to share common genetic causes. We will initially apply our analysis pipeline across a specific well- defined subtype of pure cerebellar ataxia to isolate potential disease-causing genes and mutations.  3) Lastly, we will screen identified variants in a cell culture system using human neurons with a variety of tests designed to quantitate the severity of the mutations on basic cellular functioning. This information will be used to characterize and prioritize variants of unknown clinical significance for further detailed analysis.  In summary, this study will provide a comprehensive view of the genetic etiologies behind cerebellar ataxia, define new molecular pathways important to the normal function of the cerebellum, contribute to advancements in clinical diagnosis, and help elucidate the mechanisms causing degenerative ataxia."
"9482509","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In everyday life, fast one-, two-, and multi-choice decisions are common. Rapid decisions must be made based on any number of sources of information, often in the face of quickly changing conditions. The paramount aim of the proposed research is to move a set of Cognitive Psychology theories to practical issues. The plan is to use the theories to develop tools with which to measure the basic, elemental processes by which rapid decisions are made. Currently, modern cognitive theories have had little impact on neuropsychological testing. The goal of the proposed research is to begin to change this by providing a coherent, theory-based account of rapid one-, two-, and multi-choice decisions.  The Cognitive Psychology models to be used are designed to explain the accuracy and speed of simple decisions in the research domains of perception and memory and to bridge to the practical domains of cognition and driving, and cognition and aging. For example, in driving, deciding to slow at the onset of another car's brake lights is a one-choice decision; deciding whether a patch of light is darker or brighter than the background is a two-choice decision; rating the confidence in whether a word or picture was studied earlier is a multi-choice decision. The three models we will use, one for one-choice decisions, one for two-choice decisions, and one for multi-choice decisions, use diffusion processes and share foundational properties. Each divides processing into similar components: the quality of the information upon which a decision is based, the criteria that determine how much information must be available in order to make a decision, the encoding and memory-access processes that make the needed information available, and the response execution processes that make a decision overt. Central to our aims, the models allow examination of the particular, moment-by-moment, processes that take place between the presentation of a stimulus and the response to it. The research will investigate these processes for college-age adults and elderly adults (ages 60-74).  The planned approach is to develop and test new models for one- and multi-choice decisions in a variety of domains. The one-choice model will be tested in experiments that involve simulated driving and perceptual tasks that have been used to assess the effects of sleep deprivation on cognition. The multi-choice model will be tested in the domains of memory and perceptual judgments. In both cases, planned experiments will allow comparisons of the two models to a currently well-validated two-choice model.  The eventual goal of the proposed research is the development of neuropsychological tests that can be used to assess the impacts on cognition of, for example, concussion, aging, and chemotherapy. The research will be innovative in that the one-, two- and multi-choice models have not previously been used in the diagnosis of cognitive impairments or in the tracking of recovery from them."
"9268537","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): VPS35 is a major component of retromer that is essential for selective endosome-to-Golgi retrieval of membrane proteins. Dysfunction of VPS35/retromer is implicated in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) as well as Parkinson's disease (PD), because mutations in Vps35 and SorLA (a cargo of retromer) genes have been identified in the late-onset PD and AD patients, respectively. Thus, it is of considerable interest to investigate how VPS35/retromer deficiency contributes to neurodegeneration.  Three hypotheses will be tested in this proposal. The first hypothesis is that VPS35/retromer expression in pyramidal neurons is critical to prevent AD-relevant neuropathology. The second hypothesis is that VPS35/retromer deficient neurons are impaired in BACE1 retrograde trafficking, thus increasing BACE1 activity and promoting dendritic and axonal degeneration. The third hypothesis is that VPS35/retromer deficient microglial cells are hypersensitive to TNF? family cytokines, releasing excessive proinflammatory cytokines and promoting brain inflammation and neurodegeneration. Both hypotheses are supported by our publications and recent preliminary studies. We hope that the proposed studies will not only establish novel cellular functions of VPS35/retromer in preventing hyper-activation of BACE1 and microglia, but also shed new lights into pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders, such as AD and PD. We also hope that this research may point to new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of these disorders."
"9295908","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We will use the rhesus monkey as a model of normal aging as it is free from neurodegenerative disease but does show age-related cognitive declines in cognitive function that begin by 13 years of age (humans ~ 39) and accelerate after 20 (humans > 60). Examining the neural bases of this cognitive aging, we found that cortical neurons are not lost but instead, major pathology occurs in myelinated fibers of the white matter as seen in the electron microscope (EM) and in MR imaging. Though the relationship of MRI markers to EM markers is unknown, both are strong predictors of cognitive aging. Importantly the causes of myelin damage are unknown. One hypothesis is that damage is caused by age-related oxidative stress. A novel corollary hypothesis is that this damage is magnified by age-related reductions in myelin repair. We will explore both hypotheses in two cohorts of behaviorally tested male and female monkeys that range from young adults (~5) to the elderly (>20). The first cohort consists of 24 monkeys that will be behaviorally tested and their brains analyzed for this study. The second consists of archived tissue samples and associated data from 31 monkeys used in prior studies. Data on these 55 monkeys will include cognition, MRI scans, BrdU labeling, CSF samples and serum samples. In Aim 1, we will quantify myelin pathology in brain using immunohistochemistry with an antibody to damaged myelin (EP) and assess its relationship to other pathology (e.g. lipid peroxidation) using multilevel immunofluroescence. To identify other potentially causal factors, samples of CSF, serum and brain will be analyzed biochemically with cytokine arrays. In Aim 2, multi-label immunofluorescence with BrdU and markers of mature and immature oligodendroglia will assess the capacity to maintain and repair myelin. In Aim 3, sections processed with EP will be co-registered to MRI scans that yield measures of white matter volume and myelin pathology (e.g. fractional anisotropy) to validate how well these MRI measures reflect tissue constituents. Finally, all measures will be analyzed to determine which best predict cognitive aging. This will enable future studies to target experimental treatments at specific processes of myelin damage and use validated MRI measures to follow their effects."
"9378914","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is a deadly malignancy with an overall 5-year survival rate of 6%. The molecular mechanisms that contribute to the biological aggressiveness of PDAC are being gradually elucidated, and the crucial role of high and low frequency driver mutations in PDAC is providing new insights into the complexity of this cancer. However, the widespread consequences of aberrant transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) actions in PDAC in the context of the presence of oncogenic Kras and loss of function of the retinoblastoma protein are not well understood. In this proposal we will use a novel genetically engineered mouse model (GEM) of PDAC that we generated in which oncogenic Kras is combined with RB deletion. The resultant KRC mice rapidly develop pancreatic intraepithelial (PanIN) lesions that progress to PDAC within weeks after birth, and the pancreatic cancer cells in these cancers are highly proliferative. Based on our published data and preliminary results, the KRC mouse will allow us to test the hypothesis that aberrant TGF-beta signaling in PDAC synergizes with RB inactivation, leading to deleterious actions by TGF-beta, aberrant mitogenic signaling, and enhanced pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and cancer cell-stroma interactions. We will evaluate the effects of RB loss of function on TGF-beta signaling, assess the role of TGF-beta signaling in PDAC metastasis, and delineate the contributions of inflammatory cytokines and Wnt pathways to pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and stroma formation. To this end we will use cell lines established from KRC pancreata, use other novel GEMs of PDAC generated in our laboratory that exhibit a high incidence of metastases, conduct therapeutic interventions in these GEMs, and assess the role of these pathways in human PDAC. The proposed studies will advance our understanding of PDAC pathobiology in a high impact manner, and will point the way to novel therapies for suppressing cancer growth and metastasis."
"9273897","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many cell types must become polarized to function properly within a tissue or to generate distinct daughter cells. A quintessential example of this phenomenon is observed in the eggs of Caenorhabditis elegans. Shortly after fertilization, the C. elegans zygote undergoes a dramatic, stereotyped polarization that segregates polarity factors and cell fate determinants to the anterior and posterior ends of the egg. These asymmetries are essential for cellular differentiation and organismal development. Genetic analyses have demonstrated an essential role for the conserved Serine/Threonine kinase PAR-1 in this process. Specifically, loss of par-1 protein activity in the zygote results in symmetric distributin of normally asymmetric factors. In this proposal I will combine new technologies with classical techniques to analyze PAR-1 function in live embryos. In Aim1, I will use optogenetic and Cas9 genome editing technologies to assign function to the different PAR-1 domains and test the role of PAR-1 asymmetry in patterning the zygote. In Aim 2, I will conduct an unbiased chemical genetic screen to identify critical PAR-1 substrates. This work will uncover the molecular mechanisms used by PAR-1 to pattern the zygote and regulate cell and organismal polarity."
"9206072","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PC) is the most common malignant disease in the human pancreas. It is a highly lethal disease and the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the US. Fewer than 5% of people with PC live no longer than five years. One of the main reasons it has such a poor prognosis is that the majority of patients already have metastasis at the time of diagnosis, and metastasis makes PC insensitive to many chemotherapeutic drugs including gemcitabine (GEM). Thus, new ways to combat this disease are urgently needed. We discovered that Cyr61/CCN1, an extracellular protein, is overexpressed in PC cells and specimens, and its expression is correlated with disease progression and drug resistance. Moreover, Cyr61 activates sonic hedgehog (SHh) signaling, connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), mutants K-Ras and its activator MAZ/SAF-1-transcription factor in PC cells and stromal cells, all of which contribute to the development of PC as well as drug resistance. Based on these exciting preliminary findings, we now propose to use genetically engineered cell lines, genetically engineered mouse models (GEMMs) along with state-of- the-art technology to unravel if blocking Cyr61 could inhibit PC growth and drug sensitization via blocking desmoplastic reaction in PC.  We propose three aims to test the hypothesis. In Aim 1, we will explore the role of Cyr61 in K-Rasmut mediated PC development and progression using GEMMs and orthotopic transplants of genetically engineered PC cell lines. In Aim 2, we will examine whether Cyr61 signaling is crucial to maintain stemness and tumorigenic activity of PC-initiating cells (PICs)/stem cells (PSCs) and dissect the down-stream signaling pathway of Cyr61 required to perform these events. Lastly, in Aim 3 we will determine the role of Cyr61 in growth of fibrous tissue (desmoplasia) during PC growth in GEMMs and orthotopic models. To test the aims, we have already standardized the use of an orthotopic human pancreatic cancer xenograft in a SCID mouse model using ultrasound guided injection of PC cells into the pancreas and high resolution imaging techniques. These techniques have already revealed many steps of the progression of this deadly disease, and they will be used along with the unique expertise of our multi-disciplinary collaborative team to explore the role of Cyr61 in pancreatic carcinogenesis.  Collectively, these findings will provide knowledge of the essential functions of Cyr61, not only in development of PC, but also the critical role in tumor-stromal interactions for the development of desmoplastic reaction. This knowledge will allow dissection of the molecular mechanisms behind these vital events. Moreover, these studies will directly indicate that disruption of Cyr61-signaling would be a new therapeutic strategy against PC."
"9301579","Activities of the BD2K Centers Consortium will be focused on gathering resources and achieving goals of the  Initiative in ways that could not be accomplished effectively by individual Centers. The Consortium will  assemble experts who are able to lead the fields represented under the heading of biomedical Big Data and  advance the goals of the initiative in a coordinated way, and it will draw in institutions with the resources to  provide the necessary support. We have identified several goals that we view as particularly important and  that will be addressed more effectively by the Consortium than by individual Centers.

The KnowEnG  Center at the University of Illinois is fully committed to participate actively in pursuing these objectives, and  proposes to implement the following activities: 1) organizing workshops on topics proposed by Consortium  members but of interest to all members, and building communities around the themes of the workshops that  can extend beyond the Consortium; 2) participating in Consortium-wide standards working groups aiming to  improve interoperability between tools and methods developed in individual Centers, and in close  cooperation with existing standards groups; 3) organizing small conferences, on the model of the Gordon  Conferences and with priority given to young investigators, focusing on the identification of emerging  challenges in biomedical Big Data, with associated hackathons to address current challenges; 4) organizing  Consortium-wide colloquia to address legal, ethical and privacy/security issues associated with the analysis  of biomedical Big Data"
"9287955","Abstract Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common malignant brain tumor and has a median survival of less than 15 months, presenting an urgent clinical challenge. To overcome this challenge, our research has focused on Methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP). MTAP deletion occurs in about half of GBM patients, suggesting any therapeutic strategy devised based on MTAP status will significantly impact the treatment landscape of this disease. Our preliminary study has demonstrated that MTAP deletion is associated with a worse clinical outcome. In studying the underlying mechanism, we have elucidated that the status of MTAP (presence or absence) affects GBM cells? DNA methylome and the expression of genes involved in GBM pathogenesis and in response to treatments. Furthermore, we have devised additional strategies of exploiting MTAP status for clinical benefit. Normally, MTAP functions in the salvage pathway for adenine and methionine. In MTAP-deficient tumor cells, the absence of this salvage pathway sensitizes cells to inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis, providing an opportunity to specifically target cancer cells. We have devised a novel purine starvation strategy that can effectively abrogate tumor growth. These exciting findings prompt us to further understand the molecular mechanism of MTAP deletion in GBM and refine the promising therapeutic approach we have developed. Our central hypothesis is that MTAP loss affects GBM progression via altering DNA methylation, and that MTAP deletion can be exploited for GBM treatment. Specific Aim 1: Determine the functional consequences of MTAP deletion in GBM. We will test the hypothesis that MTAP deletion affects GBM progression via altering cancer cells? DNA methylation patterns. Sub-Aim 1.1: Determine the mechanism underlying the effects of MTAP deletion on GBM cells; and Sub-Aim 1.2: Determine the clinical significance of MTAP deletion. Specific Aim 2: Develop a purine starvation-based therapeutic strategy for MTAP-null GBM. We will test the hypothesis that purine starvation can be an effective treatment for MTAP-null GBM. Sub-Aim 2.1: We will use xenograft models derived from primary GBM cultures and test their response to purine starvation; and Sub-Aim 2.2: We will determine the mechanism underlying GBM cells? response to purine starvation. This study will establish MTAP deletion as a direct therapeutic target in GBM, illuminate the mechanism underlying the consequences of MTAP deletion in GBM progression and response to treatment, generate novel in vitro and in vivo GBM models, and potentially lead to a new paradigm for clinical management of GBM."
"9281537","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) is an important source of morbidity and mortality among U.S. Military Veterans. The primary virulence factors are TcdA and TcdB, toxins that induce diarrhea, inflammation, and significant damage within the colon. This proposal is designed around the hypothesis that inhibition of toxin activity represents a therapeutic approach that can impact clinical treatment and outcome for individuals suffering from CDI.  TcdA and TcdB are homologous glucosyltransferases that modify and inactivate Rho family GTPases. The glucosyltransferase activity of the toxins has been linked to a `cytopathic' disruption of the acti cytoskeleton and is important for systemic toxicity in a mouse intoxication model. The X-ray crystal structures of small molecule glucosyltransferase inhibitors bound to the TcdA and TcdB glucosyltransferase domains (Aim 1) will provide a foundation for structure-guided design of molecules with enhanced potency.  In addition to the cytopathic effects, TcdB is a potent cytotoxin that causes necrotic damage in cells and tissue. The cytotoxicity results from TcdB-induced assembly of the epithelial cell NADPH oxidase (NOX) complex. The assembly results in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause necrosis. Preliminary data indicate that a Nox1 knockout mouse is protected from CDI tissue damage and underscores the hypothesis that inhibition of the NOX1 pathway will protect against the colonic tissue damage observed in severe cases of CDI.  A high-throughput screen has led to the identification of 176 small molecules that inhibit TcdB-induced necrosis. Experiments in Aim 2 will categorize these compounds according to their mechanism of action and result in the identification of lead compounds for further analysis. In Aim 3, the efficacy of N- acetylcysteine, an FDA-approved antioxidant, along with lead compounds from Aims 1 and 2 will be evaluated in a mouse model of CDI. Spore challenge with an epidemic M7404 strain and a panel of variants with defined mutations in one or both toxins will permit dissection of the specific effect each compound has on TcdA- and TcdB-mediated events. These are the key studies needed to advance small molecule inhibitors of the C. difficile toxins into clinical practice."
"9263016","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Biofeedback of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (rt-fMRI) data is a new technique in which the activity in a specific region of a subject's brain is provided as a feedback signal to the subject. The subject can experiment with different cognitive strategies to identify those that are effective in influencing brain activty in the region of interest. By practicing those strategies and monitoring their success, subjects can train themselves to control the target brain region. The proposed research project applies this technique to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). More specifically, the project examines whether biofeedback of rt-fMRI data can enable individuals with OCD to develop control over activity in a region of their orbitofrontal cortex involved in symptom anxiety and thereby reduce their obsessive-compulsive symptoms. If so, this new technique may yield a low-risk, non-invasive clinical intervention for OCD. In addition, patterns of resting state functional connectivty between brain areas will be examined before and after biofeedback to determine how intrinsic brain dynamics are altered by the intervention, and how those alterations relate to changes in clinical symptoms. This will inform our understanding of the network dynamics underlying obsessive-compulsive symptoms. Although this research project is focused on developing a protocol specifically for treating and studying OCD, the methodology has great promise as both a treatment intervention and a research tool for a broad range of neuropsychiatric disorders."
"9275401","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Death and disease from obesity largely result from insulin resistance and diabetes. Weight-loss strategies are too often ineffective. Targeting pathways to improve insulin sensitivity with obesit may reduce risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease; but such pathways have been elusive. We discovered a novel pathway mediated by cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) that prevents insulin resistance, even with obesity.  CETP shuttles triglycerides and cholesteryl esters between serum lipoproteins (VLDL and HDL), and tissues including liver. Pharmacological CETP inhibition raises HDL cholesterol but does not protect against cardiovascular disease. This failure may suggest non-HDL functions of CETP. Mice naturally lack CETP expression, so our lab used CETP transgenic mice to define how obesity impacts HDL protein composition. Our studies led to the surprising finding that constitutive CETP expression protected mice from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced insulin resistance -by insulin clamp techniques. This protection was despite becoming obese.  We used an innovative approach where we integrated in vivo metabolism techniques with systems-based tools in order to define the mechanism for CETP-mediated protection from insulin resistance. CETP promotes bile secretion, so we profiled metabolites from CETP mice and found that increased liver and serum bile acids associated with insulin sensitivity. We also found increased gut bile acids that recirculate to the liver and led to activation of the hepatic bile-sensor FXR and small heterodimer partner (SHP). With transcriptional profiling we found CETP augments bile signaling, and enhances insulin-suppression of gluconeogenic genes in the liver. Female CETP mice had a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity than males, which was linked to an altered network of genes that increase estradiol levels and promote estrogen signaling in the liver.  We hypothesize that CETP expression promotes insulin sensitivity by increasing bile acid secretion and bile acid signaling in the liver. We propose that CETP also promotes estrogen signaling, which is required for the full protective effects of CETP. We will explore these novel metabolic effects of CETP in 3 aims:  In AIM1 we will use transgenic mice expressing CETP driven by the human gene promoter to test the hypothesis that induction of CETP with obesity protects from HFD-induced insulin resistance by activating bile signaling pathways. In AIM2 we will define if hepatic estrogen signaling is required for CETP-mediated insulin sensitivity using mice with knock-out of the estrogen receptor alpha. We expect to define important pathways that contribute to sex-differences in glucose and lipid metabolism. In AIM3 we will focus on the bile signaling pathway, and how CETP activates SHP. Using intergrated metabolite and transcriptional network models, we expect to discover pathways that can be targeted to generate a metabolically healthy obese phenotype. These innovative studies will be an important step towards preventing insulin resistance and diabetes associated with obesity, which are a major health burden to the US Veteran population."
"9347468","Summary Early diagnosis of chronic diseases makes possible early treatment initiation. Bloodstream miRNA panels are being pursued for screening and diagnosis of the most important chronic diseases. Recently, there has been a particular interest in Alzheimer?s disease (AD) miRNA panels. If successful, these panels may become part of regular medical check-ups. However, their development and application is obstructed by the poor quantitative performance and complexity of available miRNA detection techniques such as reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and sequencing. Here, we propose the development of an accurate and simple platform for quantitative detection of miRNAs in blood that will accelerate the validation of miRNA panels and will be ideal for patient screening. We will validate the new platform by studying a specific miRNA panel associated with AD. We will develop a highly quantitative method to measure concentration of circulating miRNA based on direct detection, without purification and without enzymatic reactions. The method will be capable of highly quantitative measurements of miRNA in a variety of sample types. The first aim focuses on developing a method to detect 10 targets directly in unpurified samples. The second aim focuses on optimizing the quantitative performance of the assay, as well as validating the assay with clinical samples. This proposal will show that the new method can dramatically simplify and improve miRNA quantification. Our overall goal is to develop a powerful and flexible platform ideal for basic miRNA research and clinical diagnosis. In addition, the same platform will be useful to detect other targets, such as messenger-RNA and highly fragmented DNA with better quantitative performance, faster and easier to use than alternative methods."
"9275420","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Our armed forces are routinely exposed to hazardous weapons, pathogens, environmental toxins and, later, medical countermeasures with long-term health effects. The kidney is affected by many toxins metabolized in the body that it excretes, including products of rhabdomyolysis (skeletal muscle degradation), hemolysis, drugs, and exogenous toxins. Many of these compounds cause acute kidney injury (AKI) by producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), which activate apoptotic endonucleases. The resulting acute kidney failure (AKF) is a life-threatening condition that requires hemodialysis or kidney transplantation.  This proposal is a continuation of the previous research funded by a VA Merit Review grant. The specific aims in the previous project have been accomplished and the new goals are logical extensions of these aims. The results from the previous study show that the importance of apoptotic endonuclease G (EndoG) in mediating myoglobinuric AKI is much more complex, not limited to DNA fragmentation only, and in some cases, completely opposite to what was initially accepted. The present proposal is based on our recent unexpected observations that myoglobinuric AKI is mediated by apoptotic deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) regulated by EndoG. Prior to this study, no regulation of an endonuclease by another endonuclease has been described, and EndoG was considered one of the DNA-fragmenting apoptotic endonucleases. Contrary to this, we found that when EndoG becomes activated by later or stronger injury, it inactivates DNase I and thus protects against the injury. Therefore in the kidney, EndoG acts as cytoprotective enzyme instead of being cytotoxic.  We hypothesize that myoglobinuric AKI can be prevented by inducing of EndoG-mediated inactivation of DNase I or otherwise inhibiting expression or activity of DNase I before and/or after injury. Our specific objectives are as follows. In Aim 1, we will evaluate native DNase I- and alternatively-spliced DNase I-based therapeutic approaches to ameliorate myoglobinuric tubular cell injury and AKI. In Aim 2, we plan to determine how EndoG-mediated inactivation of DNase I can be used to blunt myoglobunuric AKI. Aim 3 will be using our new high throughput technology to screen chemical library for new DNase I inhibitors applicable for the treatment of myoglobinuric AKI.  Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care. Successful completion of these studies can potentially lead to the development of new therapeutic tools to prevent or ameliorate myoglobinuric AKI. Some of them will have strong translational value because they act even if administered after kidney injury, while others can become therapeutic options of the future. When applied to humans, the results of this study may allow saving human lives, improving the health of veterans, and decreasing the number of disabilities in the veteran population."
"9211278","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a significant risk factor for the development of hepatic insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes and is also linked to the development of other serious liver disease states including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatic carcinoma. NAFLD is recognized as a significant health problem in the VA population. Our previous results show that mitochondrial function is linked to the development of NAFLD. Unfortunately, the mechanism(s) that govern hepatic mitochondrial function and thus alter susceptibility for hepatic steatosis remain largely unknown. Peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma co-activator alpha (PGC-1?) co-activates nuclear transcriptional factors resulting in increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Both PGC-1? and mitochondrial function are suppressed in obesity. In contrast, we have shown that in vivo liver-specific PGC-1? overexpression (o/e) increases mitochondrial function and reduces hepatic lipid accumulation. But these results may not be solely attributable to increased mitochondrial biogenesis. Recent data shows that maintenance of high quality mitochondria is also dependent on the turnover and degradation of low functioning or damaged mitochondria in the lysosome by a process termed mitophagy (i.e. autophagy of mitochondria). To that end we found that PGC-1? overexpression also increased markers of autophagy, a link that has never before been examined. This proposal will test the primary hypothesis that PGC- 1? plays a primary role in mediating a coordinated co-activation of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy that is necessary for maintaining mitochondrial function and preventing and treating NAFLD. Rodent models that possess defects in mitochondrial biogenesis or mitophagy due to specific genetic alterations will be used to test the importance of the respective pathways. We will also use molecular gain of function therapy (overexpression of PGC-1?) and exercise training to modulate pathways, in addition to performing in-vitro primary hepatocyte studies to isolate hepatic specific mechanism(s) and examine acute molecular changes that underlie whole body results. The specific aims will: 1) Determine if impaired capacity for mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy increases susceptibility for hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance due to reduced mitochondrial function, and 2). Test if increased mitophagy and mitochondrial function are necessary for treatment of hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance."
"9275427","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is increasing in prevalence and affects more than 20 million individuals in the United States, and is especially common among veterans. Some causes are well known, such as diabetes and hypertension, and current management remains similar to two decades ago and consists of blood pressure control, blood sugar control, and blockade of the renin angiotensin system. More recently, we find that CKD is developing in people before they develop diabetes and hypertension, such as in subjects with metabolic syndrome, and also is developing in almost everyone as we age. Furthermore, once we have CKD, progression of kidney disease tends to continue despite our best efforts. It seems like there must be some other risk factor that has not been identified. In this proposal we present a novel hypothesis that our western diet may be driving subtle kidney disease in everyone. Specifically, we suggest that a little-known enzyme in the kidney proximal tubule, known as fructokinase, may be driving much of the current CKD epidemic. Fructokinase is an enzyme that metabolizes fructose and in the process causes intracellular ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and an inflammatory response. Diets high in sugars containing fructose can cause acute and chronic kidney disease in rats, likely due to metabolism of fructose in the proximal tubule. Recently we found that fructose can also be generated from glucose in the proximal tubule when the enzyme aldose reductase is induced, and preliminary studies suggest this may have a role in diabetic and nondiabetic CKD and also in aging-associated CKD. We therefore hypothesize that low grade fructose metabolism by fructokinase in the proximal tubule is the missing link that explains why CKD is increasing, why CKD is associated with metabolic syndrome, why CKD is occurring with aging, and why kidney disease progresses in subjects with preexisting CKD. To test these hypotheses, we will do the following studies. Aim 1 will evaluate the role of fructokinase in the CKD associated with aging and metabolic syndrome, and will also determine if CKD is accelerated by simple sugars containing fructose, sucrose, or glucose compared to complex carbohydrates. Models will include normal mice and mice with metabolic syndrome (Pound mouse) that either express fructokinase or have fructokinase systemically absent. Aim 2 will determine if fructokinase has a role in the renal progression that occurs in established CKD and whether it is accelerated by simple sugars via this mechanism. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that it is renal fructokinase that is driving aging-associated CKD and the progression of kidney disease in established CKD using mice in which fructokinase is selectively deleted from the kidney. If successful, these studies will identify a novel mechanism driving CKD that could be as important a factor as hypertension and diabetes themselves. Furthermore, our studies should be able to determine if altering the composition of simple sugars in the diet can influence progression. These discoveries could therefore lead to both dietary measures, as well as potentially new treatments to prevent CKD in veterans and others living in western cultures."
"9265410","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a resubmitted application for a K23 Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award. In terms of training, the applicant's goal is to utilize the K23 funding period to complete focused training in functional and image analysis, neuropathology, geriatrics, neuropsychology, and biostatistics. This training will take place through mentorship, a limited number of formal didactics, and through the completion of an ambitious project that will hopefully set the stage for future studies as an independent investigator.  Functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI) is a non-invasive method to assess the integrity of anatomically distributed neural networks underlying complex behaviors. In Alzheimer's disease (AD), fcMRI of the default mode network (DMN) has shown great promise as a biomarker in clinical and basic research studies, as (1) profound decreases in DMN fcMRI are seen in prodromal and clinically evident AD and (2) the DMN is among the sites of early amyloid deposition in AD. However, using fcMRI as an early AD biomarker is limited by the overlapping changes in connectivity seen in normal aging, which, in turn, limits the identification of early AD subjects to enroll in clinical trials. To address this limitation, we propose a series f studies that use fcMRI to disambiguate normal aging from early AD by focusing on the pattern of degeneration across six well-described cortical networks in two unique subject populations. The central hypothesis of these studies is that early AD and aging will show distinct patterns of network degradation, with preferential degradation of cognitive networks (especially the Default Mode and Attention Networks) in early AD as compared to aging. We test this hypothesis by comparing young and old subjects with and without evidence of AD pathology, leveraging newly available data from young subjects with dominantly inherited AD (DIAD) drawn from the Dominantly-Inherited Alzheimer's Network (DIAN). Notably, the comparison of the DIAD population and older at-risk and symptomatic patients followed in the Harvard Aging Brain Study represents a unique opportunity to disentangle age and AD pathology, as DIAD carriers have disease onset at a young age (often in the late 30s and early 40s). In addition, using PET data on tau burden in our older subjects (from F18-T807 PET, a newly-developed tau radioligand), we will explore the relative contributions of amyloid and tau pathologies to altered fcMRI. These studies will serve the dual purpose of (1) optimizing the use of fcMRI as an AD biomarker by identifying patterns of fcMRI change that distinguish aging and AD, and (2) provide novel insight into the systems-level pathophysiology that distinguishes aging and AD. Further, these studies will compare the timing and pattern of network degradation in dominantly-inherited vs. sporadic AD and provide critical context for the interpretation of fcMRI data currently being gathered in (a least) three major AD prevention trials in older individuals at-risk for sporadic AD and dominantly-inherited AD."

"9274782","Abstract  Funds are requested to upgrade high-throughput genomic sequencing capabilities of the Genomics Core at the University of Kansas Medical Center through the purchase of an Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencer. The Genomics Core (GC) has provided microarray services since 2002 and high throughput sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 platform since 2011. Demand for our sequencing services has grown continuously since their inception, and we now provide services to a broad user base at the University of Kansas, affiliated Kansas Institutions, and throughout the Central Midwest region. Recent advances in sequencing technology have dramatically improved high throughput sequencing by reducing user cost, decreasing run time, and increasing the amount and quality of data; unfortunately, our current instrument is not able to take advantage of these key advances, with the result that the cost and quality of discovery by our investigators will suffer. The proposed upgrade to the Illumina HiSeq 4000 will ensure that our sequencing capabilities are and will remain optimal for the foreseeable future. The enhanced attributes of the HiSeq 4000 will be critical to supporting NIH-funded center grants that rely heavily on the Genomics Core, which include KUMC's Cancer Center, Alzheimer's Disease Center, Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities Research Center, Polycystic Kidney Disease Research Center, CTSA, and 3 Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence. The HiSeq 4000 will serve 28 major and 8 minor University of Kansas users with 31 (27 R01-equivalent) NIH grants, representing a subset of a larger user base at 25 institutions across a 14-state region. The HiSeq 4000 will be located in space already optimized for Illumina operations and will be integrated into a core network that provides comprehensive administrative infrastructure including online tracking of requests, automated billing, and user-polling for quality assurance, as well as bioinformatics and technical support and newly expanded IT infrastructure. New users are recruited using a proven, collaborative pilot program mechanism, and the GC is backed by a strong institutional commitment to both the acquisition and operation of the instrument. The acquisition of the Illumina HiSeq 4000 will enhance the rate and quality of scientific discovery of our large and diverse user group, but will also reduce costs to the investigator by approximately 57% per gigabase, thereby providing significant investigator savings that can be applied toward other NIH-funded research activities.  "
"9484367","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a proposal to conduct a two arm randomized effectiveness trial investigating whether a task shifting/sharing model of treating depression and improving adherence to ART in patients who fail first line antiretroviral therapy (ART) can occur using nurses in South Africa trained in CBT. South Africa is the country with the highest number of HIV infections in the world and the highest number of HIV/AIDS-related deaths,5-7 and where access to third line ART treatment is not currently available in the public healthcare system. Clinical depression, like elsewhere, is one of the highest comorbidities to HIV/AIDS, with estimated rates up to 34.9 percent.8 Depression, in the context of HIV, leads to poor self-care behavior such as non-adherence to ART and worse retention in care, which are critical for treatment success.9 Preliminary work. The U.S. based investigators have developed and successfully tested an approach integrating adherence counseling into cognitive- behavioral therapy for depression in HIV.10,11 The South. Africa based team, in collaboration with the U.S. based team, has conducted preliminary work to evaluate the cultural appropriateness and feasibility of integrating this approach into the South African HIV treatment setting. Accordingly, we have 1) conducted an open-pilot of the treatment in Cape Town with 6 HIV-infected patients with depression using a clinical psychology PhD student as the therapist, 2) conducted formative qualitative research on the manifestation of depression and ways to adapt this approach for the South Africa HIV care setting,12 3) successfully trained two clinic nurses in the adapted version of the intervention, and 4) completed an open pilot feasibility trial with 14 patients with these nurses as interventionists. Design: The current study builds on our successful feasibility pilot. Given that CBT is a validated treatment for depression, and that dissemination of evidenced-based interventions in HIV is a noted priority,13,14 we propose a two-arm effectiveness RCT (stratified by antidepressant medication initiation/use or not) of nurse-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for depression and adherence integrated into the HIV primary care setting in S. Africa. To ensure that those who need this intervention the most will receive it, participants will be patients with HIV who have failed first line ART, and have a unipolar depressive mood disorder. Primary outcomes (Aim 1) include adherence to ART (assessed by WisePill), depression (assessed by an independent evaluator), and proportion of (second line) treatment failures in each condition. Comparing this integrated care model to usual care (enhanced adherence counseling for first-line treatment-failures in this setting), will allow for an incremental cost-effectiveness analysis in Aim 2. We will collect resource utilization and cost data to examine the cost- effectiveness of reduced depression, and potentially, better HIV outcomes. Before study start-up, and twice a year, we will convene community advisory meetings of HIV patients as well as stakeholders (clinic directors, Nurses AIDS service NGO leaders) to maximize the chances of uptake scalability of the model should it be successful."
"9420170","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cadmium is a heavy metal and carcinogen that is present at superfund sites, in battery manufacturing facilities, in and around zinc smelters, and in cigarettes (the most common exposure pathway). An epidemiological study of 5- to 14-year-olds in a heavily Cd-contaminated area indicated a high correlation between Cd exposure and immunomodulation1. Although the mothers of these children were likely carrying a heavy Cd body burden during the gestation of their children, the direct effects of prenatal exposure (as opposed to postnatal exposure) on measured immunomodulation cannot be distinguished-an important consideration, since the postnatal effects of prenatal and adult exposure to xenobiotics often differ markedly. Prenatal exposure of C57Bl/6 mice to Cd causes reduced regulatory T cell (Treg) numbers and markedly increased antibody (Ab) in female offspring up to 20 weeks of age. Wnt levels are also markedly reduced2 and Wnt signaling has been linked to Treg cell production and stability. Thus, we will test the hypothesis that prenatal Cd exposure decreases Wnt signaling that results in decreased Treg cell function and subsequently, increased Ab production. The limited epidemiological evidence, coupled with our laboratory studies using mice, imply that the probable immune consequences of prenatal Cd exposure are cause for alarm. The study we propose will address the overall hypothesis that prenatal exposure to Cd reduces regulatory T cell (Treg) function resulting in marked increases in antibody (Ab) which may lead to a higher propensity to developing autoimmune disease or reduced tumor surveillance. It comprises three aims: Aim 1: Determine the Effect of Prenatal Cd Exposure on T Regulatory Cells; Aim 2: Determine the Role Decreased Wnt10b Activity in CdTx Newborn Offspring Plays in Thymocyte Development; and, Aim 3: Determine the Potential for CdTx Offspring to Exhibit Exacerbated Autoimmune-Induced Pathology due to Increased Ab Production."
"9301152","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a very aggressive subtype with limited therapeutic options. Intriguingly, women of African American (AA) origin have much higher TNBC-related mortality rates compared to European American (EA) women. This difference is evident even after adjusting for socioeconomic status and access to care, indicating a biological basis. TNBC tumors in AA women exhibit higher rate of growth and metastasis in comparison to TNBC in EA women. There is an urgent need to understand the molecular mechanisms involved in aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. In our preliminary studies, we observed that AA-TNBC cells have higher invasion and migration potential in comparison to EA-TNBC cells showing inherently aggressive nature of AA-TNBC. In a preliminary screen, we found that a large percentage of AA-TNBC tumors exhibit loss-of-tumor suppressor Liver Kinase B1 (LKB1) in comparison to EA-TNBC tumors. Our preliminary microarray studies also found that LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncoproteins- YAP and TAZ. Our data suggest that with inherent loss of LKB1, AA-TNBC gain `an oncogenic input' in the form of activated YAP-TAZ signaling. Using in vitro studies, clinical AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC samples and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we will test our hypothesis that inherent LKB1-loss in AA-TNBC results in activation of oncogenic YAP-TAZ signaling leading to aggressive progression and increased metastatic potential of AA-TNBC. Our novel findings also suggest that AA-TNBC tumors may be vulnerable to therapeutic strategies directed at YAP-TAZ inhibition. Based on our strong preliminary data, we will investigate how loss of LKB1 in AA-TNBC might lead to acquisition of higher YAP-TAZ, and drive growth and metastasis of AA-TNBC cells. We will also analyze AA-TNBC and EA-TNBC tumors to establish LKB1-loss and elevated YAP-TAZ as biomarkers of aggressive progression of AA-TNBC. We will utilize these biological insights to test and propose safe and effective therapeutic strategies to target AA-TNBC. Using patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models, we propose to investigate whether AA-TNBCs are particularly susceptible to YAP-TAZ inhibition strategies and whether currently clinically available drugs (screened from a drug library) can be repurposed to target YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Secondly, we plan to examine whether Honokiol, a natural compound from Magnolia grandiflora, (selected from a screen of known bioactive compounds) and its novel analogs have the potential to inhibit YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC. Our studies will provide new understanding how loss-of-LKB1 and gain-of-YAP-TAZ in AA-TNBC form a relentless axis that drives AA-TNBC. These studies will provide novel insight into molecular mechanisms underlying racial disparity in TNBC and provide a novel set of biomarkers and potential drug-targets to develop novel ways to reduce the disparity in clinical outcome of AA and EA TNBC patients."
"9282603","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Presently antiretroviral therapies can preserve or restore immune function in HIV-infected people, but roughly 50% of them succumb to mild sub-dementia forms of HAND that are largely refractory to treatment. We propose innovative research to test the new hypothesis that the pathogenic processes responsible for HAND ensue early after virus transmission, they persist despite later antiviral or immune control of virus, an they may be exacerbated by opiate use. The testable translational implication of this hypothesis is that therapies targeting key determinants of the early neuropathogenesis may prevent HAND. The hypothesis will be tested in an established system of HIV infection and early cognitive impairment in immunocompetent mice inoculated with mouse-tropic HIV, EcoHIV. The natural history of cognitive disease in these mice closely models mild HAND in HIV-infected humans. HIV enters the mouse brain within 5 days of systemic infection with cognitive impairments developing 4-5 weeks later and persisting despite adaptive antiviral immunity and virus suppression. Brain pathology was normal but cognitive dysfunction correlated with suppression of synaptic plasticity genes including CaMKII and SYN2; both genes also had gene-silencing epigenetic modifications of histone 3 on their promoters as determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation, suggesting stable disruption of some synaptic functions in HAND. Chronic morphine exposure and HIV synergized in causing cognitive impairment in mice. We postulate that the brain injury inflicted soon after infection of mice, before establishment of adaptive immune responses, is largely irreversible and initiates a neuropathogenic program leading to cognitive impairment. The overall goals of this application are to test this proposition, explore selected mechanisms involved, and apply the findings to identify therapies to prevent HAND. The Aims are: 1) To define virological and synaptic determinants of subclinical HAND and its progression to clinical disease; 2) To determine morphine effects in subclinical and clinical HAND; 3) To test a novel mechanism of pan- dysregulation of synaptic plasticity genes in murine HAND by chromatin remodeling and the potential role of Tat; 4) To explore interventions disrupting preclinical HAND to prevent progression to clinical disease. We believe that use of cognitive impairment as a relevant disease readout, combined with versatility of mouse experimentation, will facilitate identification of key physiological and molecular processes involved in HAND. Studies will be conducted exclusively in mice, both conventional and specific knock-out strains, principally through systemic infection with EcoHIV, with/without chronic morphine treatment through implantation of timed- release pellets. Selected disease markers identified in mice will be confirmed in archival brain tissues of MND patients stratified by opiate addiction. Timed interventions will include inhibitors of chromatin remodeling."

A mentoring team, led by Avron Spiro, Ph.D. (Boston University; BU), Laura Kubzansky, Ph.D. (Harvard University), and David Almeida (Pennsylvania State University; PSU), with assistance from several consultants, will guide Dr. Lee in conducting the proposed research and training activities. Building on Dr. Lee's background in clinical aging and quantitative methodology, the Training Plan will allow her to: (1) obtain training in the physiology of human stress response; (2) advance her knowledge of pathophysiologic processes that underlie age-related diseases; and (3) gain skills to lead an independent research program. Key training activities include formal coursework and didactics; mentorship from interdisciplinary experts; hands-on training in study design, data collection and analysis; and conference attendance. Training will take place at BU and PSU. Training activities are augmented by implementing a mentored Research Plan. The goal of the proposed research is to examine abnormal acute stress response and multisystem physiologic dysregulation as mechanisms that explain the negative effects of cumulative psychosocial stress exposure on cardiovascular disease and premature mortality. The Specific Aims are to: (1) examine acute stress response as a mediator of the association between cumulative psychosocial stress exposure and multisystem physiologic dysregulation; and (2) examine age trajectories of physiological functioning over 2 decades as mediators of the association between cumulative psychosocial stress exposure and later-life health. These aims will be addressed by analyzing multi-modal data from the nationally representative Midlife in the United States study and longitudinal data from the VA Normative Aging Study using structural equation models. The significance of the proposed research lies in: (a) a more precise understanding of the biological mechanisms by which the cumulative impact of psychosocial stress exposure gets under the skin to affect physical health across the lifespan, and (b) the identification of a risky profile of acute stress response that signals early risk for stress-related negative health outcomes. This project directly addresses NIA's strategic direction (A-1) on discovering causes and risk factors associated with disease and disability in older adults. Findings are expected to inform the development of interventions to reduce disease burden in later life (strategic direction B-1). This award will equip Dr. Lee with in-depth knowledge and skills to lead an independent and interdisciplinary research program to investigate the mechanistic links between stress and health across the lifespan."
"9275332","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Diabetes is an epidemic in USA and Veterans are nearly three times as likely as the general population to have diabetes. Patients with diabetes have an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease and more than 75 percent of them die of cardiovascular complications. Given that the prevalence of type 2 diabetes continues to increase steadily and the prevalence of CVD in patients with type 2 diabetes continues despite advances in the management of CVD, it is crucial to develop new therapeutic strategies for cardiovascular disease to reduce mortality in diabetic patients. In recent years, a large number of studies have provided strong evidence that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated toll-like receptor (TLR)4 plays an important role in chronic inflammation and atherosclerosis in diabetes. Since type 2 diabetes is also associated with an increased saturated fatty acids (SFAs), we have investigated the impact of SFAs on LPS stimulated TLR4 activation in macrophages. Interestingly, we found that palmitic acid (PA), the most abundant SFAs in diabetes, amplified LPS-triggered TLR4 signaling on inflammatory gene expression in macrophages by 4-fold. We also found that acid sphingomyelinase (aSMase) plays a key role in the amplification of TLR4-mediated inflammatory signaling by PA. Overall, our recent studies have elucidated an interaction between TLR4 signaling and sphingolipid metabolic pathway: LPS and PA have a synergy on aSMase-mediated sphingomyelin hydrolysis and subsequent ceramide/sphingosine 1 phosphate (S1P) increase while the ceramide/S1P increase in turn amplifies TLR4-mediated signaling. Since all our above findings were made in vitro, it is important to confirm the observations in vivo. Thus, we proposed to determine if high-fat diet (HFD) enriched with PA and LPS administration increase atherosclerosis cooperatively via sphingolipids. We proposed animal studies to confirm our in vitro observations and studies with macrophages to explore the mechanisms involved in the synergy between PA and TLR4 signaling. Specific objective 1: To determine if HFD enriched with PA enhances the stimulatory effect of LPS on atherosclerosis in diabetic LDL receptor-deficient (LDLR-/-) mice and if aSMase plays an essential role in the enhancement. We hypothesized that HFD enriched with PA enhances LPS-induced atherosclerosis in diabetic LDLR-/- mice, and aSMase-mediated sphingolipid metabolism plays an essential role in the enhancement. Specific objective 2: To determine the mechanisms involved in the synergy of PA and LPS on S1P production and the role of S1P in IL-6 upregulation. We hypothesized that LPS and PA exert a cooperative stimulation on sphingosine kinase (SK), and S1P augments the inflammatory signal stimulated by LPS and PA by enhancing NF?B signaling. Specific objective 3: To determine the mechanisms involved in the cooperative activation of aSMase by LPS and PA. We hypothesized that LPS and PA have a cooperative stimulation on protein kinase C (PKC)?nd aSMase membrane translocation, leading to increased aSMase activity and ceramide production. METHODS: For Objective 1, systemic inflammation will be induced by administration of low dose LPS, and HFD enriched with PA will be given to LDLR-/- mice to induce diabetes. We will then determine sphingolipids, vascular inflammation and atherosclerosis using lipidomics, histology, and immunohistochemistry. We will also employ LDLR-/- mice with aSMase-deficiency to determine the role of aSMase in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis. For Objective 2, we will perform cell and molecular biology studies.  This study will provide novel insight into the interaction between inflammation and dyslipidemia in diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis and is important for developing new therapeutic strategies. The incidence of diabetes in Veterans is much higher than that in general population. This research project will provide important information for developing new therapeutic strategies to prevent fatal cardiovascular events in our Veterans with diabetes."
"9275373","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Neuropathic pain is common among Veterans, substantially impeding their attempts to rehabilitate function. Numerous contributing mechanisms have been identified, but have not led to any new therapies. Initial observations show that cannabinoids may hold promise for new therapeutic approaches. There is growing recognition of the participation of endocannabinoids (ECs), which are endogenous agonists of cannabinoid receptors (CB1R), in the central regulation of pain by descending inhibition of sensory pathways (antinociception), although their site of action has not been determined. There is evidence that the EC system in the dorsal periaqueductal gray (dPAG), a key pain regulatory center, may contribute to antinociception. Promising preliminary data from our lab shows an upregulation of cannabinoid signaling in the dPAG in a subset of rats that did not develop neuropathic pain after nerve injury. Therefore, we propose to explore the dPAG as a potential locus for pain control, and test the overall hypothesis that activation of the EC system in the dPAG drives descending analgesic signaling that suppresses neuropathic pain. The dPAG has the potential to coordinate analgesic mechanisms with autonomic control since activation and EC-modulation of dPAG neurons increases sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure. We have previously established a link between susceptibility to development of neuropathic pain and autonomic activation by showing that rats with elevated initial sympathetic tone do not develop hyperalgesia when subjected to spinal nerve ligation (SNL). Sympathoexcitation is typically not a desired side effect of EC-induced analgesia in the setting of chronic pain. We will therefore also explore specific mechanisms whereby ECs in the dPAG could selectively regulate autonomic activation versus analgesia. The program is organized into three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will characterize anatomic and pharmacologic features of dPAG circuitry specific to antinociception and sympathoexcitation. These explorations will provide critical insights into dPAG circuitry at a novel level of detail and establish whether changes in dorsal horn sensory neuron (DHN) activation and sympathetic outflow show patterns of differential control. Antinociception will be defined by inhibition of DHN neuron activity while sympathoexcitation will be recorded as elevated sympathetic nerve activity. Agents will be microinjected into the dPAG that excite neurons and activate or attenuate cannabinoid system function. An understanding of the dPAG mechanisms that integrate antinociception with sympathoexcitation will provide opportunities to dissociate the desirable cannabinoid antinociception from unwanted cardiovascular effects. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate injury-induced changes in the expression of components of the dPAG cannabinoid system. Specific molecular consequences underlying dPAG contributions to pain will be characterized in rats showing a range of hyperalgesia after SNL. Gene and protein expression levels of components of the cannabinoid system in the dPAG will be correlated with the degree to which hyperalgesia develops in individual rats. These experiments will test the hypothesis that upregulated EC signaling in the dPAG prevents the development of hyperalgesia following nerve injury, suggesting a therapeutic potential of dPAG cannabinoids. Finally, in Specific Aim 3, we will identify the role of the dPAG cannabinoid system in the development of neuropathic pain. Our preliminary findings support an important and previously unrecognized role of dPAG cannabinoid signaling in the generation of neuropathic pain. Cannabinoid system function in the dPAG will be attenuated acutely by microinjection of a CB1R antagonist or chronically by RNA interference to downregulate CB1R in rats undergoing SNL, a model of neuropathic pain, and the effects correlated with levels of hyperalgesia. These experiments will test the hypothesis that loss of CB1R function in the dPAG contributes to the development of neuropathic pain."
"9206085","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      The inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA activates several types of receptors that are therapeutic targets for the treatment of epilepsy and other neuropsychiatric illness. GABAA receptors are linked to a Cl ion channel and produce electrical signals when activated at synapses. GABAB receptors are G-  protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that regulate intracellular signaling pathways. In addition to synaptic GABAA receptors, there are unique GABAA receptors localized to extrasynaptic sites. These high-affinity extrasynaptic GABAA receptors are tonically activated by the low levels of ambient GABA in the brain. The tonic form of inhibition produced by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors importantly affects cellular and network excitability.  Emerging data indicate that extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in several brain regions are regulated by postsynaptic GABAB receptors. Because the intracellular signaling pathways affected by GABAB receptors are shared by many GPCRs, other neurotransmitter receptors may also regulate extrasynaptic GABAA receptors. This proposal describes three hypotheses to investigate the regulation of extrasynaptic GABAA receptors in health and disease.  It is hypothesized that multiple neurotransmitters acting through GPCRs regulate extrasynaptic GABA receptors. Tonic currents produced by extrasynaptic GABAA receptors will be recorded from dentate gyrus granule cells (DGGCs) and CA1 pyramidal neurons in acute hippocampal brain slices using standard whole cell techniques. The effects of intracellular signaling pathways on tonic currents will be investigated. Using selective agonists and antagonists, the effects of other GPCRs (i.e. ß- adrenoreceptors, D2 dopamine receptors, and 5-HT2 receptors) on tonic currents will be determined. It is predicted that tonic currents will be enhanced by PKA inhibition  (D2 receptors) and PKC activation (5HT2 receptors). Activation of PKA by ß-adrenoreceptors is predicted to reduce tonic currents. Biochemical studies will be done to determine if intracellular signaling pathways enhance tonic currents by increasing surface expression of GABAA receptors.  Spontaneous physiological or pathophysiological neural activity can produce periodic and transient increases in ambient GABA levels. It is hypothesized that periodic increases in ambient GABA will activate postsynaptic GABAB receptors and enhance extrasynaptic GABAA receptor function. Tonic currents will be repeatedly measured before and during procedures to periodically increase ambient GABA. Three approaches will be used to produce transient increases in ambient GABA; 1. periodic application of exogenous GABA, 2. stimulating release of endogenous GABA (electrical stimulation, high K+), and 3. inducing spontaneous interictal discharges with 4-AP. It will be confirmed that the effects of these procedures resulted from postsynaptic GABAB receptor activation using the GABAB receptor antagonist CGP55845 and pipette solutions containing a G protein inhibitor (GDP-ß-s).  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) alters  GABAA receptor function in the hippocampus. It is hypothesized that GPCRs regulate extrasynaptic GABAA receptors following experimental TBI. We will determine the effects of TBI on basal tonic currents and their regulation by GPCRs. Specifically, it is hypothesized that tonic currents of DGGCs will be enhanced by TBI, due in part to increased activation of GPCRs."

"9357491","Summary/Abstract What is known: Liver-to-body mass-ratio is held constant by a phenomenon named the ?hepatostat? [1]. When liver is damaged, an ensuing state of systemic hepatic insufficiency induces regenerative proliferation. A regulatory axis has been uncovered that is dependent on levels of circulating bile acids (BA), which are both synthesized and recycled by hepatocytes. BAs reclaimed from the gut enter the circulation and activate the farnesyl-X-receptor (FXR) in enterocytes (mice) or other cells (human). This induces secretion of FGF15/19 into the enterohepatic circulation [2-4]. At the liver, FGFR-signaling in hepatocytes feedback-regulates BA production by repressing CYP7A1 expression [5] and modulates bioenergetic pathways [6]. In a less-well understood process, BAs and FGF15/19 also coordinately regulate pro- and anti-regeneration activities in the liver. The balance of these activities determines whether the hepatocytes proliferate [7-9]. New insights: It is becoming increasingly recognized that redox signaling participates in many physiological functions. We recently reported that livers of mice in which hepatocytes lack both thioredoxin reductase-1 and glutathione reductase (TR/GR-null) - the entry points to the two major cytosolic antioxidant systems - are 2.1- fold larger than normal [10], suggesting these mice have a mis-calibrated hepatostat. These mice also have elevated BA levels. Surprisingly however, neither cholesterol-free diets nor inhibition of cholesterol synthesis to limit BA precursors, nor treatment with cholestyramine to increase fecal BA excretion, normalize circulating BAs. This suggests that, along with having a defective hepatostat in which pro-regeneration activities predominate, systemic feedback regulation of BA synthesis is disrupted in mice with TR/GR-null livers. What is proposed: Because the TR/GR-null condition is restricted to hepatocytes, we predict that FXR- induced production of FGF15 in enterocytes is normal. We hypothesize that hepatostat- and BA feedback- signals are redox-regulated and therefore disrupted in TR/GR-null hepatocytes. To test this hypothesis, we propose two specific aims: Aim 1, to assess enterocytic FGF15 production and hepatocytic activity of FGF15- induced signaling cascades in WT or TR/GR-null livers. Aim 2, to assess protein-Cys modifications on components of the FGFR4-dependent pathways in these livers and determine which of these affect signaling and gene expression outcomes that regulate the hepatostat. Anticipated outcomes and value: BAs function in lipid digestion, toxin-excretion, and the hepatostat. In turn, lipid catabolism, toxin exposure, and regeneration are each associated with increased oxidative stress. In this Exploratory Project, we hypothesize that there are previously unrecognized redox-regulated components on the BA/hepatostat axis that ensure appropriate coordination of these activities with the cellular redox status. Modulation of this could be helpful in therapies addressing liver injuries or toxic exposures."
"9278685","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A major problem in the field of eukaryotic infectious diseases remains unsolved: why are some parasites pathogenic but other closely related ones relatively benign? Here we propose to address this problem by studying malaria, a diverse suite of pathogens where some cause severe morbidity yet others can be asymptomatic. By studying the gene expression of malaria parasites that infect birds, we will elucidate the evolution of pathogenicity and identify genes that cause morbidity. We will test the hypothesis that certain genes are differentially expressed between virulent and benign pathogens. Using a bioinformatics approach, we will compare the transcriptomes of avian pathogens and identify whether different genes are expressed, and/or if they are expressed at different levels between the virulent and non-virulent Plasmodium species. By selectively mutating avian malaria genes, we will verify the alleles responsible for pathogenesis. The CRISPR/Cas9 approach has been used recently to disrupt genes in Plasmodium falciparum. This will be the first use of this approach in a non-mammalian malaria system. The proposed research is timely and significant in that it will advance the field of malaria research by providing an important new model system to identify factors contributing to malaria pathogenicity. This work is innovative because birds provide the only model system where two highly related malaria parasites cause such fundamentally different outcomes to both laboratory and naturally occurring wild hosts. The long-term and cross-disciplinary goal of this research agenda is to elucidate the evolution of pathogenicity and identify conserved virulence mechanisms that may be overlooked using mammalian model systems. The aims of the proposal are to: 1. Sequence the complete transcriptomes of select avian malaria parasites. 2. Characterize differences in gene expression between virulent and non-virulent parasite strains. 3. Use a CRISPR/Cas9 approach to disrupt virulence genes and confirm effects through the infection of laboratory birds. The project will support the education of future scientists through an integrative approach to research and education. It will train students in cutting edge technologies associated with infectious disease research, and provide valuable experiences for graduate and undergraduate students at an urban university serving large numbers of underrepresented minority students. The developmental objectives of the PI will be met by working with outstanding collaborators, which will further his training in the genomics of malaria."

In response to the IRG's comments, we provide information further on about the covariates we assess and sample characteristics; the effects of covariates on key outcomes; explicate further the study's significance; note changes in the Methods, and summarize new findings. Using a high-risk family design, we have been studying a clinical sample of adolescent probands with juvenile-onset depression (JOD) histories, their never- depressed (high-risk) siblings, and healthy controls. We propose 3 synergistic studies as the logical next step, based on our findings and the recent literature. Study 1 addresses the extent to which dysphoric mood in daily life reflects individual differences in features of mood repair responding and/or context, and how well contemporaneous lab-based assessment of mood repair and RSA relate to real-life mood repair. After a lab- protocol, affect and naturalistic mood repair will be sampled via Ecological Momentary Assessment in 100 probands, 100 high-risk siblings, and 100 controls; the 7-day sampling interval will overlap with each subject's birthday to assure a uniform life event with potential affective significance. Study 2 investigates mechanisms: it examines the hypothesis that the capacity to switch attention away from depressogenic material and associated dysphoria is a key mechanism of adaptive mood repair, subject to individual differences in biobehavioral functioning. Using a ?proof of concept? approach, probands (n=160) will be randomly assigned to sham attention training or training to improve the ability to switch attention away from negative material; effects of attention training on mood repair will be examined in the context of RSA profiles and prior mood repair success. Study 3, which extends the follow-up period of the prior study, proposes that atypical RSA profiles (non-normative combinations of resting RSA+RSA response to sad mood) and low positive affectivity are bona fide, pre-morbid risk factors for first-onset depression: it will include 175 high-risk siblings and 175 healthy controls who did not yet have clinical depression at their last research evaluation. As a secondary goal, we will characterize developmental trajectories of mood repair repertoires from late childhood into emerging adulthood. Using multilevel modeling, study results will shed further light on when (and how) mood repair fails (or succeeds), attention as a mechanism, and the role of ANS functioning. Results also will serve to identify modifiable pre-morbid predictors of depression risk and developmental as well as contextual moderators of clinical outcomes. Overall therefore, the proposed study will contribute to evolving models of the etiology depression, and also help advance personalized therapeutic and preventive interventions for depression, with the ultimate goal of benefitting public health."
"9357505","Project Summary/Abstract Rates of dementia diagnoses and personal experience with dementia are staggering. Dementia?s impact is wide ranging, affecting the lives of those diagnosed as well as their caregivers, friends, and family. Therefore, people may worry about the possibility of developing dementia well before they do (if they ever do). Indeed, almost one third of an adult population surveyed identified dementia as their most feared disease, second only to cancer (MetLife, 2011). The proposed research will focus on dementia worry ? the anxiety about dementia prior to symptoms or diagnosis. Because dementia worry can exist in persons of varying age and cognitive status, it is important to investigate this phenomenon among middle-aged and older adults. In spite of the prevalence of Alzheimer?s disease and related disorders (ADRD), understanding of dementia, its causes, and symptoms remains low. Increasing awareness of ADRD combined with minimal understanding of ADRD is believed to pose a potent threat to adults of all ages, particularly middle-aged and older individuals. People with high dementia worry are believed to view ADRD as threatening due to the high perceived negativity of dementia, high perceived risk of ADRD, and low perceived control or means for prevention. There is currently little research concerning the impact of dementia worry on daily life, psychological functioning, and future planning. Using experimental methods, the proposed research will induce different levels of dementia worry experimentally (based on commonly encountered environmental cues such as ageist stereotypes, prevalence statistics, and dementia awareness campaigns) to assess some potential psychological and health-related consequences of dementia worry. Finally, we will investigate ways to reduce dementia worry, taking the initial steps in developing and assessing the immediate and short-term impact of interventions, with our final study including a three month follow-up to determine if beneficial effects may last. Consistent with NIH?s mission to increase understanding of mental disorders and NIA?s mission to support research designed to improve the health and well-being of older adults, the proposed studies will increase understanding of dementia worry, its impact on functioning and psychological well-being, with the goal of identifying pragmatic interventions to reduce dementia worry and improve well-being."
"9288446","PROJECT SUMMARY At the national level, there has been significant interest in addressing U.S. health disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. Although there is growing evidence to suggest race/ethnic disparities in dementia exists in the U.S., much of the evidence of disparities is indirect or comes from geographically- localized studies that may not be generalizable to the experience of Americans as a whole. Furthermore, there is little evidence to indicate whether disparities are widening or shrinking over time. Thus, the aims of this proposal are to (1) describe race/ethnic disparities in the incidence of experiencing Alzheimer's disease and related dementia at the national level in the U.S. and examine the extent to which race/ethnic disparities in incidence have changed over time, and (2) describe race/ethnic disparities in over- or under-diagnosis of prevalent Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the medical setting at the national level in the U.S. and examine the extent to which race/ethnic disparities in under- or over-diagnosis have changed over time. To accomplish these aims, we will use data from the nationally representative U.S. Health and Retirement Study (HRS), the Aging, Demographics, and Memory Study (ADAMS), and linked Medicare data. For Aim 1, we will build on previous work creating algorithms to predict dementia status from ADAMS using only HRS data (ADAMS participants are sampled from HRS) in order to create an improved algorithm with optimal validity across and within race/ethnic groups. We will then apply this algorithm to assign dementia status to each eligible HRS participant at each HRS interview. From this we will derive age-standardized estimates of dementia incidence in HRS by race/ethnic group (self-reported non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic) over two time periods, 1998-2004 and 2006-2012. For Aim 2, we will use Medicare claims data to determine whether each eligible HRS participant had a diagnosis of dementia prior to or within 1 year after each HRS interview. We will then estimate agreement between the Medicare-based and algorithmic dementia diagnosis assigned at each HRS interview from 1998 to 2012 within race/ethnic groups to quantify disparities and temporal trends in over- or under-diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia. This contribution is expected to be significant as it will provide (i) national and historical benchmarks against which to compare current and future data on local race/ethnic disparities in both the incidence and over- or under- diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; (ii) evidence summarizing temporal changes in race/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia; (iii) improved algorithms for diagnosis of dementia in HRS that maximize validity in minority populations; and (iv) evidence for the feasibility of linking of multiple data sources to provide valid estimates of race/ethnic disparities in Alzheimer's disease and related dementia in the U.S."
"9326882","Summary:  Urinary incontinence (UI) has a profound negative impact on quality of life and associated with increased risk of hospitalizations or nursing home admissions in older women. UI leads to functional decline and mobility limitations. More importantly, mobility limitations are predictive of UI onset and severity. The bidirectional relation between UI and mobility limitations in older women suggests common causal mechanisms with generalized poor muscle function contributing to the development of UI and mobility limitations. The current UI treatments in older women miss the critical components to improve mobility in older women suffering from UI. Therefore, older women with UI and mobility limitations may not have optimal improvement of their symptoms, especially in the context of maintenance of functional independence.  Our long-term goal is 1) to improve quality of life in older women suffering from UI and mobility limitations that have common etiological causes and 2) to evaluate the role and contribution of atrophy and fat infiltration in pelvic floor (levator ani, internal obturator) and lower body (gluteus maximus, medius, minimus) muscles as causal mechanisms in the development of UI and mobility limitations in older women. Our central hypothesis is that a muscle strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program designed to improve endurance and lower body mobility combined with the strengthening of pelvic floor muscles will reduce pelvic floor and lower body muscle dysfunction and weakness, enhance strength and endurance, and improve continence and mobility in older women. The rationale for the proposed research is that a multimodal rehabilitation program targeting to improve physical function through strengthening pelvic floor and lower body muscles will have greater efficacy in reducing UI symptoms and improving physical function than current PFMT alone in older women suffering from UI. We will test our hypothesis with a randomized controlled trial in older women with symptomatic UI with the following aims: 1) Evaluate UI symptoms and mobility limitations after a three-month multimodal strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program combined with PFMT as compared to current standard PFMT alone in women ? 70 years with symptomatic UI; 2) Examine changes in the quality of pelvic floor and gluteal muscles before and after a three-month multimodal strengthening and aerobic conditioning rehabilitation program combined with PFMT and PFMT alone based on muscle Magnetic Resonance Imaging. The primary outcome in the study is the reduction UI episodes after the intervention.  This proposal is innovative because we propose a multimodal rehabilitation program that will treat both UI and mobility as well as new biomarkers in lower body muscles dysfunction in older women with UI and mobility limitations. The study will allow the PI to transition to independent research to improve quality of live in older women with UI by decreasing UI and mobility limitations. The knowledge obtained from this research will enhance our fundamental understanding in the development of UI and mobility limitations. This proposal will fulfill the Institute of Medicine goals to increase clinical research that will lead to improved care and more effective treatments for older patients with multiple medical conditions."

"9264957","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex disorder that affects memory and progresses to a debilitating dementia. Evidence shows that the nature of our dietary intake influences both epigenetic changes and disease-related genes, thus potentially increasing or reducing our risks of developing diseases such as AD. This application examines novel mechanisms that link a specific dietary agent (palmitate) to a specific transcription factor (CHOP) that may work in concert to cause AD-like pathology in mice. Characterization of such mechanisms may help identify new etiological factors and targets for drug discovery for AD in humans.  CHOP (C/EBP-homologous protein) is expressed in the cytoplasm at low levels in normal conditions and is specifically overexpressed following sustained stress to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Various agents including environmental (chemical or dietary), genetic, and pathological factors can induce ER stress. The objective of this proposal is to test the hypothesis that the saturated free fatty acid palmitate triggers or exacerbates AD-like pathology by mechanisms involving the activation of the transcription factor CHOP; inhibiting CHOP precludes palmitate-induced AD-like pathology. Our hypothesis is formulated based on our recently published data and preliminary results showing that (i) a palmitate-enriched diet triggers AD hallmarks in wild type mice and exacerbates AD-like pathology in the triple transgenic mouse model for AD (3xTg-AD); (ii) CHOP levels are increased in postmortem brain tissue from humans with AD, in vivo in the 3xTg-AD, and ex vivo in mouse hippocampal slices incubated with palmitate; and that (iii) deleting CHOP gene abrogates palmitate-induced AD hallmarks. In the light of our postmortem, in vivo, and ex vivo results, we propose that determining the particular functional link between the common dietary agent palmitate and the transcription factor CHOP is extremely important to the continuing effort of identifying new etiological agents and genes that may be relevant to the pathogenesis of AD. We propose the following Specific Aims to test our hypothesis: Aim 1: Characterize the functional relationship between palmitate feeding and the triggering of AD-like pathology in mouse models. Aim 2: Determine the role of CHOP in the progression of AD-like pathology in mouse models. Aim 3: Determine the extent to which available drugs that inhibit CHOP prevent or delay AD-like pathology in mice.  Completion of the proposed studies may show that the saturated free fatty acid palmitate promotes AD- like pathology in mice through CHOP activation. This is important to identifying etiological factors and genes related to the pathogenesis of AD in humans. Using existing drugs or designing new agents that inhibit CHOP might be promising targets for determining their translational potential in reducing the progression of AD."
"9303234","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many neurological diseases occur in the absence of neurodegenerative pathology, such as neurotransmission disorders. Deficient neurotransmission is a hallmark of many neurological diseases, such as depression, schizophrenia and autism. Moreover, deterioration in synaptic function also appears during ageing, accompanied by a decline in cognitive and behavioral function. Synaptic strength and plasticity, important in cognitive functions such as memory, are affected by synaptic activity. However, the regulators of synaptic strength, either activity-dependent or independent, are far from understood. Here, I propose to explore how environmental cues and ageing can affect synaptic morphology in the nematode C. elegans, and how this correlates to synaptic function and activity. In C. elegans, which is an excellent model for neuroscience, synaptic sites can be observed with fluorescent fusion proteins. However, fluorescently labeled synaptic sites are small and faint, and obtaining large number of high-content data poses many experimental limitations. The main goal of this proposal is to elucidate regulators of synaptic function through multidimensional morphological profiling of synaptic sites. This work is composed of a mentored and an independent research phase. During the mentored phase, I will develop tools that allow high-throughput quantitative multidimensional profiling of synaptic morphology in large populations of animals. These tools are based on combining microfluidics, automation, and computer vision methods for image analysis, which enable streamlined quantitative morphological characterization of synaptic sites. In addition to this, tools to determine synaptic function in the motor circuit through the quantification of locomotive activity and controlled stimulation of excitatory neurons will be developed to correlate synaptic morphology to function. The mentored phase will also include extensive training in various aspects: technology development, biology and neuroscience, and career development. The scientific environment at the institution of the mentored phase is highly collaborative and provides excellent support in terms of facilities and intellectual opportunities. During the independent research phase, I plan to apply the developed tools during the mentored phase to uncover how environmental cues can affect synaptic function through activity dependent or independent mechanisms. I will also utilize these tools to study synaptic decline during aging, and how exposure to environmental regulators of synaptic function during development can alter synaptic decline during aging. In this way, we will be able to address a biological question unapproachable with conventional methods. This approach is innovative not only because the technology developed will greatly increase the throughput and quality of characterization, but also because it proposes studying the links between form and function in synaptic sites. This project is significant because it will enable streamlined morphological studies in neuroscience, which should lead to uncovering pathways, genes and potential therapies for synaptic function deficiencies due to disease or age-related decline."
"9275393","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are capable of self-renewal and differentiation into multiple cell lineages. Because of these capabilities, MSCs play an important role in continuous maintenance and repair of most tissue types. The quantity and quality of MSCs decrease with aging, which, in turn, is associated with the progressive failure of function of tissues and organs. Recently, we reported in mice that defects in the self-renewal and bone formation capacity of aged MSCs were completely restored by exposure to extracellular matrix (ECM) made by marrow stromal cells from young animals, and such improvement was substantially diminished when cells (from either young or old mice) were cultured on ECM made by old marrow stromal cells. This led us to investigate whether this phenomenon also occurs in humans. Indeed, our preliminary studies in human subjects clearly suggest that culturing aged MSCs on ECM made by young marrow stromal cells is able to improve their number and quality. The goal of this proposal is to determine the mechanisms whereby young ECM rejuvenates old bone marrow-derived MSCs. A unique, cell-free ECM model will be used to dissect how young ECM restores the functions of old MSCs in vitro and in vivo. The hypothesis proposed in this application is that age negatively impacts the formation of an ECM that normally preserves MSC function, and the quantity and quality of aged MSCs can be improved by exposure to an ECM made by stromal cells from young donors. We are uniquely-positioned to test this hypothesis in humans since, in addition to our strong preliminary data, up to 100 human bone marrow samples have been accumulated in the past three years from elders (60 to 96 years old). To test this hypothesis, we will systematically evaluate biological activities in viro and in vivo of young vs. old MSCs maintained on young- or old-ECM (Specific aim 1), and conduct proteomic analysis of young- and old-MSCs exposed to young- or old-ECM to elucidate the underlying changes at the protein level that are associated with the restored functions of the rescued cells (Specific aim 2). To fully understand the mechanisms underlying the influence of MSC behavior, we will determine the differences in the structures of young- vs. old-ECM including the architecture, mechanical properties, and protein composition (Specific aim 3). These studies are innovative in that we will have established, for the first time, a unique in vitr human model to examine effects of age on MSCs (intrinsic theory), and changes to MSCs by the surrounding ECM (extrinsic theory). Our studies are important from a translational point of view because they will provide key information that can facilitate the use of a patient's own (autologous) stem cells for cell- based therapies. In view of the fact that the elderly are the mai target population for this type of treatment, understating age-related changes in both MSCs and host is essential for improving the clinical outcome of transplanted autologous MSCs in old veteran."
"9266441","General Description of the Research Core Facility. The RI-INBRE core facility was inaugurated in July 2003. The facility will be completing its tenth year of operation this year. Financial support is provided by the RI-INBRE grant and by all seven institutions that are participating in the network. In August 2012, the facility was relocated from the College of Pharmacy's old building, Fogarty Hall, to its new building at the URI's Kingston campus. The core facility is located on the fourth floor, and occupies 3,220 sq. ft., which represents a 70% expansion over the previous space (Figure 3.2 in Section 3.5). Included in the space are separate rooms for cell culture, microscopes, radioactive counters, as well as space for the staff. There are two chemical fume hoods, which are certified for the use of toxic chemicals. In addition, there is provision for both short-term and longer-term back-up power for critical equipment.    The facility staff provide research and training support to RI-INBRE participants as well as other scientists affiliated with the network institutions throughout the state. The facility services are also extended to Rl's non?profit research organizations and private companies on a fee-for-service basis. Both basic and advanced analytical instrumentation required for biomedical, pharmaceutical, and biotechnological research are available for shared usage. Rl's geographic compactness facilitates user access. All network institutions are within 35 miles of the site. The access is further enhanced through the core facility website (www.uri.edu/inbre/corelab), which allows participants to reserve major equipment online on a first-come, first-served basis. A user-fee structure has been placed in effect starting June 2013 to ensure future sustainability of the facility.    The core facility has proven to be a major factor in enhancing existing research and forging new collaborative initiatives within Rl's research community. At the state level, the facility is listed on a searchable website of the Rl STAC maintained by the Rl Research Alliance (http://stac.ri.gov/alliance/), a statewide platform for promoting collaboration across COBRE, INBRE, EPSCoR, and other research networks. It is also listed on  Brown's shared resource facilities website (://biomed.brown.edu/research/facilities) and searchable website (www.CoresRI.org ).  At the national level, the facility is listed on the Vermont Genetics Network (Vermont INBRE) website (www.vgn.uvm.edu/corefacilities/)."
"9386358","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) accounts for 5% of malignancies and while it is the eighth most common cancer in US women, it is the fifth leading cause of cancer deaths. It is now considered not as a single disease, but rather as a diverse group of tumors with distinct origins, histotypes, mutation profiles, protein and gene expression profiles, and prognosis. Over 75% of EOC is high-grade serous (HGSC), accounting for 90% of disease-specific mortality. Systematic molecular characterization of HGSC by the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and others has demonstrated robust gene expression subtypes of HGSC. HGSC subtypes have been studied almost exclusively in individuals of European ancestry, and it is thus unknown whether these or other subtypes exist in populations with different genetic backgrounds and exposures. Indeed five-year relative survival from EOC is only 36.4% for African American (AA) women, compared to 44.3% for European American (EA) women. For breast cancer, aggressive subtypes are more common among AA women than EA women, and this partially explains survival differences. It is possible that aggressive subtypes of  HGSC are overrepresented in AA women, but analogous research in EOC is in its infancy because it is one ninth as common as breast cancer, and molecular subtypes have only recently been identified. The                African American Cancer Epidemiology Study (AACES) is an ongoing multi-site population-based study which will ultimately include 850 AA women with newly diagnosed EOC and their age-matched controls. This study will examine socioeconomic, epidemiologic, genetic and clinical factors and ovarian cancer risk and survival. As the only epidemiologic study of EOC in AA women to date, it provides a rich resource to examine molecular features of this disease. For 300 AACES participants, we propose to generate whole transcriptome data from their formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded HGSC ovarian tumors and exome sequencing data from these tumors and corresponding peripheral blood to: determine gene expression-based, and mutation-based, subtypes of HGSC tumors in AA women, compare the relative frequencies of subtypes in AA and EA populations, and evaluate whether subtype-specific survival differs by population; and characterize similarities and differences in gene expression patterns and mutational spectra across each of the molecular subtypes in AA and EA women to define key subtype-specific and population-specific pathways. The results from this study will provide key information to understand survival differences in AA women, and will more precisely define molecular subtypes allowing for future functional characterization and therapeutic development."

"9275406","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Exposure to environmental and chemical hazards is thought to be a major contributing factor to Gulf War illness (GWI) (US Dept VA). Of particular concern for Gulf War Veterans is chronic inhalation of sand, dust and airborne particulates while in theater which pose significant risk for development of respiratory diseases including pulmonary fibrosis (PF). PF is a chronic lung disease characterized by accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM), destruction of normal lung architecture, and decreased capacity for gas exchange. The activated fibroblast is the primary effector cell in PF. However, targeting activated fibroblasts is challenging due, in part, to the heterogeneity of the population. This heterogeneity is thought to reflect the multiple proposed origins of fibroblasts, making it essential to elucidate the role of fibroblasts from all origins i PF.  Using mice whose bone marrow was reconstituted by a clonal population of cells derived from a single enhanced green fluorescent protein positive (EGFP+) hematopoietic stem cell (HSC), we have demonstrated an HSC origin for fibroblasts and activated fibroblasts in multiple tissues. We also identified a CD45+DDR2+ HSC-derived circulating fibroblast precursor (CFP) in peripheral blood of mice and humans that is related to the monocyte, gives rise to activated fibroblasts, produces pro-fibrotic factors, increases with disease, and can be therapeutically targeted. Using a silica model of PF that mimics particulate exposure in Veterans of the Gulf War, we have shown that CFPs increase in circulation with PF and traffic to the fibrotic lung. Together, our findings support the hypothesis that HSC-derived CFPs are critical to progression of PF and can be targeted to inhibit fibrotic progression. This will be tested using our novel clonal HSC cell transplantation method in conjunction with a silica instillation PF model in three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will temporally examine CFP contribution to silica-induced PF and potential of CFPs to serve as an early biomarker for disease and/or response to therapy (Aim 1). Studies in Aim 2 will elucidate mechanisms regulating participation, activation and pro-fibrotic effects of CFPs. Finally, we will examine the effect of therapeutically targeting this unique fibrotic progenitor using both mouse-to-mouse transplant and human-to-mouse xenograft models to demonstrate that inhibition of CFPs can reduce progression of silica-based fibrosis and is applicable to human disease (Aim 3).  The proposed studies are paradigm shifting in that most studies focus on targeting the activated fibroblast or relatively mature fibrocyte in fibrosis, whie our data suggests that the more primitive CFP may provide a more effective therapeutic target. These studies are significant in that they are the first to conduct flow cytometric, immunohistochemical, molecular, and functional evaluation of HSC-derived CFPs and their contribution to PF. It is suggested that the number of Veterans diagnosed with Gulf War Illness, including respiratory diseases, is grossly underestimated. As GWI is better defined and the Veteran population serving in the Gulf ages, we expect to see an increased incidence of PF in the Veteran population. Studying early markers of PF is of great relevance to the VA mission as it will allow us to better detect early signs of PF in patients, potentially using CFPs as a biomarker, to dramatically improve effectiveness of treatment prior to loss of normal lung architecture and function. Therefore, these studies have the potential to directly impact Gulf War Veterans' health as well as have far-reaching application to Veterans with multiple types of fibrotic disease."
"9266291","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT?BIOINFORMATICS GROUP   The scale of research in the life sciences is increasing rapidly, due in part to the growing ubiquity of  ?omics?. High-throughput and high-dimensional assay technologies, including variations of DNA sequencing,  array/lab-on-a-chip assays, mass spectrometry, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and other  technologies, allow investigators to study entire genomes, transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes,  microbiomes, and other large-scale systems. Researchers examine biological systems holistically, looking for  patterns and emergent properties or simply cast a wide net by measuring many more variables simultaneously  in an experiment. DAIT-funded investigators are increasingly using these approaches. Advances in information  technology also drive the increasing scale of research by facilitating the creation, sharing, pooling, and analysis  of large databases of research data. Bioinformatics meets these scalability opportunities and challenges by  applying techniques from computing, statistics, mathematics, and engineering to the management, analysis,  and dissemination of large and or complex biological data sets.   The Bioinformatics Group (BG) will serve as a core component of the DAIT Statistical and Clinical  Coordinating Center and will help maximize the value of data collected by DAIT-sponsored clinical and  mechanistic investigators by fostering long-term capacity for data sharing and utilization by the general  research community. Building on Rho's extensive experience as a Statistical and Clinical Coordinating Center  for a number of NIH and DAIT research networks, the BG will play a role in every stage of the data lifecycle:  During study planning the BG will provide expert guidance to investigators on experimental design, emerging  technologies, and analytical approaches, particularly with regards to the application of omics and other high-  dimensional data types. The team will collaborate with investigators and other bioinformatics organizations to  develop data standards for clinical and mechanistic data and apply those to DAIT study data sets and  information systems developed by the center. Implementing these standards will ensure that data are  consistently structured and annotated and will make them more easily shared and pooled. The BG will provide  tools, high performance computing infrastructure, and analytical support for high-throughput and high-  dimensional data sets. Finally, it will serve as the primary conduit for data dissemination from supported DAIT  programs through the development of study portals for live data access and transfer of final study data sets to  public repositories, such as ImmPort and TrialShare."
"9206095","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Stroke is the fourth leading cause of mortality and a major cause of morbidity in the United States. Despite significant progress in the prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke, less is known about mechanisms and prevention of hemorrhagic stroke. We will use a hereditary stroke syndrome, Cerebral Cavernous Malformation (CCM), to study mechanisms underlying hemorrhagic stroke and cerebrovascular disease. CCM is characterized by chronic vascular leak leading to inflammation and by subsequent acute bleeding resulting in hemorrhagic stroke. This study will have direct and immediate application to the more than 100,000 veterans estimated to have CCM, and has significant potential to affect millions of veteran as our conclusions are applied more broadly to cerebrovascular disease. A significant subset of CCM cases is familial and represents a genetic cause for hemorrhagic stroke. Three separate genes have been identified in these families associated with CCM (KRIT1, OSM and PDCD10). These widely expressed genes are required in the endothelium for normal vascular development, endothelial cell cytoskeletal structure, and endothelial barrier function. In particular, the loss f KRIT1 and OSM results in very similar phenotypes in embryos, adult mice, and endothelial cell culture. Both KRIT1 and OSM have been found to bind each other as part of a complex of cytoplasmic proteins involved in scaffolding small GTPases involved in the cellular response to stress and controlling the cellular cytoskeleton and barrier function. A major endothelial signaling cascade involves nitric oxide (NO) produced by an endothelial isoform of nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) to induce smooth muscle relaxation, prevent platelet aggregation, limit smooth muscle proliferation, and inhibit leucocyte adhesion. The loss of KRIT1 in fibroblasts results in increased reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, whether increased ROS plays a role in the pathogenesis of CCM due to mutations in KRIT1, OSM, or PDCD10 has not been established. Importantly, some evidence suggests that the dysregulated signaling pathways associated with loss of function of each CCM gene may be different. Therefore, we hypothesize that increased ROS as a result of the loss of CCM proteins is a key contributor to vascular pathology in CCM, which can be rescued by scavenging excess superoxide, and serves as the downstream common pathogenic mechanism of CCM disease. This work will test an important functional hypothesis and clarify a promising potential therapeutic target in a hemorrhagic stroke syndrome and has the potential to provide a roadmap for bench-to-bedside translation to human clinical trials in the near future. Further, this work may serve as the foundation for future examinations of the use of superoxide scavengers in the treatment and prevention of other cerebrovascular disease. This proposal has both immediate translational potential for more than 100,000 veterans estimated to have CCM disease, and will underlie additional progress for diseases more broadly affecting the Veterans population."
"9271222","Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs), the most common therapeutic procedure in US hospitals, is effective at preventing morbidity and mortality in anemic patients. However, stored RBC units progressively develop functional defects known as RBC storage lesions that may affect clinical outcomes. Donor-specific factors may also determine the transfusion efficacy of stored RBCs. Because transfusion of RBC units that are defective, due to storage time and/or donor factors, may adversely affect thousands of patients annually, approaches should be developed to screen these units from the blood supply. Metabolomics is a powerful approach to identify biomarkers that correlate with metabolic and functional changes in stored RBCs. In support of our objective to identify metabolic biomarkers for donor testing, we have now demonstrated that AS1-RBCs from > 90% of donors show typical changes in hundreds of metabolites during 42 day storage (the typical metabotype), whereas the remaining donors have markedly divergent metabotypes. Intriguingly, there is not single atypical metabotype: all donors we have tested to date with atypical metabotypes differed significantly from one another. Thus, we propose that these divergent metabotypes differentiate a small percentage of stored RBCs as metabolic/functional outliers, and that metabolic alterations identified in their RBCs can be used to develop biomarkers to detect RBCs with different survival or efficacy characteristics after transfusion. In the proposed studies, we will utilize RBCs from known-poor storing donors to identify metabolic biomarkers that correlate with several measures of in vitro dysfunction during storage. These biomarkers will then be used to screen random donors, some of whom will also be tested for in vivo RBC survival after transfusion to test whether the candidate biomarkers (which were initially identified from known poor-storing donors) can in turn identify randomly selected donors with poor-storage characteristics. Successful completion of this work will result in identification of a series of RBC biomarkers that predict altered RBC function during blood storage, that can be further validated for clinical use, and that can be used as a starting point to dissect mechanisms underlying poor-storage characteristics of donated RBCs."
"9276257","Project Summary/Abstract  The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased at an alarming rate (>500%) in the last few  decades, far exceeding any other cancer type, in the United States. The prognosis for EAC patients remains  poor with very limited treatment options. Although Barrett?s esophagus (BE), a columnar metaplasia of the distal-  esophagus epithelium, is the only known precursor of EAC, the vast majority of BE patients however do not  develop dysplasia or cancer; consequently the factors driving progression from BE to EAC remain elusive. Our  long-term objective is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying EAC progression, such that reliable biomarkers  and targeted therapies can be developed for effective management of this deadly disease. Recently, using  innovative RNA sequencing in BE-associated lesions, we identified two large intergenic non-coding RNAs  (lincRNAs) showing marked and selective inductions in ~50% of EAC lesions. Both lincRNAs exhibited nuclear  localization, and preliminary functional assessments strongly suggested these lincRNAs to play pro-tumorigenic  roles during EAC progression. Our study thus provides the first global analysis of lincRNAs in this disease,  identifying two novel lincRNAs with potential oncogenic roles in esophageal carcinogenesis. Accordingly, the  specific goals of the current proposal are: (AIM 1) To elucidate the function of candidate EAC-associated  lincRNAs. We will generate CRISPR/Cas9-based inducible lincRNA-knockout EAC cell line models to  comprehensively characterize the phenotypic effects of candidate lincRNAs using both in vitro, and in vivo  xenograft experimental systems; (AIM 2) To dissect the molecular regulatory networks upstream and  downstream of EAC-associated lincRNAs. We will evaluate for potential genomic/epigenomic mechanisms  driving lincRNA expression in EACs; using the EAC cell line models, we will perform global gene expression  microarray profiling to delineate the genes/pathways modulated by the lincRNAs; and we will use ChIRP-seq/-  MS approaches to map the genomic occupancy and to identify potential gene targets and protein partners of  candidate lincRNAs, thus establishing a regulatory-roadmap of candidate lincRNAs; (AIM 3) To determine the  timing and stage-associated deregulations in candidate lincRNAs during EAC progression. Our preliminary  findings showed both lincRNAs being induced in high-grade dysplasia (HGD), a histopathologic surrogate for  EAC risk. Accordingly, we will validate and ascertain the frequency of lincRNA deregulations in these overtly  pre-malignant phases of disease progression. Additionally, we will test: whether non-dysplastic BE lesions,  within close proximity to EAC, show induction of these candidate lincRNAs; and whether candidate lincRNAs  show induction early-on in non-dysplastic BE/low-grade dysplasia (LGD) mucosa, derived from high-risk patients  who developed cancer during follow-up. Success in these studies will uncover molecular mechanisms  contributing to EAC progression; enable development of evidence-based molecular biomarkers for early cancer  detection and surveillance; and open new avenues for targeted therapies in this increasingly fatal cancer."
"9283803","The goal of this application is to develop a research program that, as stated in the call entitled The Neural Mechanisms of Multi-Dimensional Emotional and Social Representation (RFA-MH- 17-300), incorporates innovative approaches designed to move the fields of affective and social neuroscience beyond single region-based, modular, and static models of brain function and behavior. The RFA calls for research that is multi-dimensional, that is, that investigates the role of (among others) complex contexts, as well as distributed and/or dynamic processes that unfold over time. The objective of the present application is to jointly investigate emotional and social processes in a richly multi-dimensional manner. Aim 1: Network organization and evolution during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to uncover how large-scale brain networks are organized and evolve temporally during emotional and social processing. Networks will include brain regions that robustly respond to the tasks proposed, and regions from well characterized networks, including the salience, executive control, and task-negative networks. Aim 2: Naturalistic processing during emotional and social processing. The objective of this aim is to understand naturalistic processing of emotional and social information. Although standard experimental designs afford great control over experimental conditions, they lack ecological validity and restrict the experiments that can be studied. We propose to investigate continuous (?naturalistic?) processing during movie watching involving emotional and social content. Continuous processing will be investigated via intersubject correlation analysis, which measures the extent to which signals are correlated across participants. Aim 3: Development of network organization/evolution and naturalistic processing. The objective of this aim is to investigate multi-dimensional emotional and social processes from a developmental perspective. Most developmental research in emotion has focused on observing amygdala responses and those of a few other brain regions during face perception. We focus on a question largely neglected in prior research, specifically sustained threat processing and the involvement of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. In the context of social processing, this aim examines the development of intersubject synchrony. Across the emotional and social domains, we propose to study middle childhood (8-9 y), early adolescence (12-13 y), and young adulthood (18-19 y)."
"9387721","Project Summary  Cryptococcosis is an opportunistic infection that occurs in immunocompromised individuals including AIDS patients, organ transplant recipients, cancer patients, and those treated with immunosuppressive therapies. It is estimated there are one million cases of cryptococcosis and proximately 600,000 deaths worldwide annually. The infection starts in the lung via inhalation of the encapsulated fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. However, the major and most lethal complication of cryptococcosis is meningoencephalitis. To cause meningoencephalitis, C. neoformans must disseminate from the lung and enter the bloodstream. As such, fungemia, detected frequently in AIDS patients during cryptococcosis, is believed to be one of the most critical steps in the development and persistence of cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. However, little is known about intravascular clearance of the disseminating C. neoformans due to technical challenge for in vivo studies. In particular, a critical gap in our understanding remains: Does a mechanism exist to actively eliminate disseminating C. neoformans out of vasculature, and what is the mechanism? Liver is situated at a confluence of arterial and venous blood. Kupffer cells (KCs) constitute ~90% of the tissue macrophages in the whole body and account for ~15% of the total liver cell population. CRIg, a unique complement receptor, has been recently identified on KCs of humans and animals. Although the liver is not a target organ of cryptococcosis, we hypothesize, based on our preliminary data, that KCs play a critical role in filtering of disseminating C. neoformans out of circulation via a mechanism involving complement receptor CRIg. We will test the hypothesis by addressing the following aims using intravital microscopy and other advanced approaches: (1) To characterize the role of KCs in filtering C. neoformans out of vasculature; (2) To dissect the mechanism(s) involved in capture of disseminating C. neoformans by KCs. The findings from this study will suggest that a therapeutic strategy aimed at enhancing macrophage recruitment and activity in the liver could help reducing the risk of cryptococcal meningocephalitis in AIDS patients."
"9445973","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last period of T32 funding was accompanied by growth in the presence of aging research with the installation of 2 new Centers within the institute for Aging research and its ~50 investigators. The Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging (NIA) has Cores and pilot and feasibility grants and the Glenn Center for the Biology of Human Aging provides pilot and feasibility studies to move into human genome, tissues and drug research. Together with 3 aging-related program projects (P01) in genetics and the biology of aging, R01s, K awards funding from AFAR and the Ellison Medical Foundation, and a graduate course in Biology of Aging, we have capabilities for great exposure to aging research when training graduates and post-doctoral fellows. This last period of T32 funding has been a success judging by the quality of candidates, their scientific and academic achievement, the number of trainees who are now successful faculty members, the number of MDs trained and the number of minority individuals trained. Because we do not wish to reject or defer excellent candidates, we ask for one additional slot for pre-doctoral trainees and one for postdoctoral trainees for our program. For this competitive renewal application for this Training Grant, we propose new approaches and changes to our training: 1) Our focus is on the 3 'legs' of modern aging research with all investigators funded at least in part for aging research: Aging-Genomics (Jan Vijg, group leader); Aging-Metabolism (Nir Barzilai, group leader); and Cellular-Aging (Ana Maria Cuervo group leader); 2) We have a cadre of young funded investigators who will become mentors alongside an experienced co-mentor. Thus we do not limit this opportunity only to senior mentors with a more extensive track record and make ensure quality training. 2) We will encourage participation in P01 projects where the group exposure is more intense and projects tend to have translational aspects. 3) Based on our success during the last funding period, we will continue to seek MDs who are ready to transit to academic life in genetics or biology of aging. 4) All of our trainees commit to take the 30 hour, highly ranked, graduate course on the biology of aging. 5) Numerous seminars, retreats and symposiums are available for trainees to present their work and interact on an Institutional level. Thus, our training program has been very strong and is getting stronger due to the uniqueness of our Institute and its resources, allowing participants to gain state-of-the-art research training, enabling them to embark on careers involving research in aging and aging-related diseases."
"9353274","Abstract Research Patients who reach end stage renal disease (ESRD) late in life are increasingly being placed on hemodialysis (HD) without feeling they have ever been given a choice of treatment options. A moral imperative to treat everyone has resulted in a 57% age adjusted increase in HD among octa- and nonagenarians from 1997- 2003. Most patients report they were not presented with any options but to start dialysis. Despite growing recognition of this failure to respect patients' autonomy, little is known about how patients chose between ESRD treatment options or whether decision aids (DA) can improve the situation. DAs have been shown to empower patients to make choices consistent with their values and goals of care. DAs also increased patient participation in decision making and positively impacted patient-provider communication. We hypothesize that a simple in-visit DA that shows individualized risk and benefit estimates of treatment options for ESRD will facilitate shared decision making and help patients choose the treatment consistent with their values and preferences, increasing their autonomy. In this study we propose: To bolster the dignity, autonomy, and quality of life of elderly patients with ESRD by 1) Improving risk prediction and its point of care translation through a decision aid 2) Critically assessing the ethical and economic tensions surrounding the current payment reform in dialysis to safeguard patient autonomy and access to care and to inform future health policy. Successful completion of this project has the potential to affect the lives of thousands of elderly patients facing these difficult decisions annually in the US, through wide dissemination and policy implications. Candidate Dr. Thorsteinsdottir is passionate about justice in health care and resource allocation during these challenging times of aging populations. She brings to these tasks a unique mix of education and experiences. She is board certified in general internal medicine and palliative care and has completed a fellowship in bioethics at Harvard Medical School. She also has practiced in many different health care settings in different health care systems. By undertaking these aims Dr. Thorsteinsdottir will position herself for independence as an aging outcomes researcher. Her overall goal is to become an independently funded researcher and a national leader in geriatric outcomes research: To this end her objectives are 1. Improve skills in observational data analysis in older adult populations: Because of the paucity of randomized data on the frail elderly and inherent challenges with recruiting into such trials, it is essential to be able to navigate large observational registries to determine the risks and benefits of therapies for the very old. Formal development in this area will position Dr. Thorsteinsdottir for future collaborations with national as well as international colleagues through established institutional collaborations such as the High Value Health Care consortium and Karolinska University in Sweden as well the NIH funded AGES study in her native Iceland. 2. Improve skills in qualitative research techniques: To be able to develop interventions to improve decision making, Dr. Thorsteinsdottir will need a clear understanding of the values of patients, families/caregivers and clinicians. Qualitative research is essential to understand these values and to further her career development. 3. Acquire skills designed to facilitate translation of risk prediction into point of care interventions. Dr. Thorsteinsdottir plans to design a decision aid for patients confronted with a decision to dialyze. To do this she needs a solid foundation in the essential theories and skills of shared decision making. The K award would allow her to continue to seek answers to important questions regarding the individualized risk-benefit balance for dialysis in the frail elderly patients. It would allow her to pursue training in applied epidemiological methods, health economics and shared-decision making as well as qualitative and translational methodology and to forge links with researchers in the field for collaborative dissemination and implementation work in a future R01 proposal Mentorship and Institutional environment We have assembled a strong local mentorship team of NIH funded experts in the fields of knowledge synthesis, shared decision making, ethics and health economics as well as geriatrics, frailty and dementia that will guide Dr. Thorsteinsdottir through the proposed research and training. To augment this team, we have assembled a panel of nationally recognized advisors to monitor my progress through the career development program and provide mentorship and connections within their areas of expertise. The research will be conducted at Mayo Clinic a premier research institution with access to extensive epidemiology, health services and translational research resources that will enhance Dr. Thorsteinsdottir's chances to achieve her ambitious aims."
"9275422","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Acinetobacter baumannii is an important nosocomial pathogen that causes a range of infections, including respiratory and urinary tract infections, meningitis, endocarditis, wound infections, and bacteremia. In fact, A. baumannii is now responsible for up to 20% of all intensive care unit infections in some regions of the world with pneumonia being the most common presentation. Additionally, A. baumannii is a considerable cause of infection in combat soldiers and is the most common gram-negative bacillus recovered from traumatic injuries to extremities obtained on the battlefield. The clinical significance of A. baumannii has been propelled by this organism's rapid acquisition of resistance to virtually all antibiotics. Taken together, these facts have established A. baumannii as a significant threat to the health of Veterans. Based on this, we have recently initiated a research program focused on identifying novel targets for therapeutic intervention against A. baumannii. In this application, we describe our discovery of an immune enhancing biologic that has tremendous therapeutic efficacy against A. baumannii pneumonia and can cure this infection in mice.  We have made the exciting discovery that transposon mutagenesis of A. baumannii severely attenuates its virulence, regardless of the site of transposon insertion. Moreover, strains that have experienced transposon mutagenesis are capable of curing infections caused by wildtype A. baumannii during co-infection experiments, and this attenuating phenotype does not require that the transposon mutagenized strain is viable. This attenuation requires exposure of a DNA-protein complex on the surface of A. baumannii, and relies on key innate immune signaling pathways in the host. Finally, we have found that transposon mutagenesis of A. baumannii leads to up-regulation of genes encoding for the Type IV secretion system (T4SS) and increased abundance of pilus-like surface appendages visible by electron microscopy. Based on these findings, we propose a model whereby A. baumannii up-regulates its T4SS upon exposure to exogenous DNA, and this secretion system is recognized by the innate immune system of the host to coordinate clearance of the invading pathogen. To test this model we propose a series of three integrated Specific Aims. In Aim 1 we will define the immune response elicited by A. baumannii T4SS hyperexpressors. Results obtained from these experiments may lead to the rational design of immunomodulatory therapies for the treatment of bacterial pneumonia. In Aim 2 we will elucidate the mechanism by which transposition alters T4SS expression. In these experiments we will determine the mechanism by which the T4SS is up-regulated upon exposure to foreign DNA and interrogate the impact of the A. baumannii T4SS on DNA transfer and exchange. These results will lay the foundation for studies focused on reducing DNA transfer and preventing the acquisition of antimicrobial resistant determinants by this organism. Finally, in Aim 3 we will determine the broad spectrum efficacy of T4SS-based immune enhancing biologics. A. baumannii transposon mutants exhibit therapeutic efficacy against pneumonia caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa suggesting that this strategy has broad applicability against a variety of infectious agents. In addition to the potential clinical benefits of this discovery, these proposed experiments will provide us with a tool to study the host-pathogen interaction during infection with the goal of defining a successful immune response to pneumonia caused by Gram negative pathogens."
"9275416","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale: HIV-1 infection and its prevention are of particular importance to the health of veterans, with 1 out of 250 veterans known to be HIV-1 infected. Prevention of HIV-1 was specifically mentioned as one of the 3 main goals in President Obama's National HIV/AIDS Strategy in 2010, as well as the Department of Veterans Affairs National HIV/AIDS Strategy Operational Plan in 2011. Our group has focused on a preventive vaccine for HIV-1 through study of potent antibodies directed at HIV-1. A limited number of persons infected with HIV-1 develop circulating plasma antibodies able to potently neutralize a wide variety of HIV-1 isolates representing different genetic subtypes. It is widely held that the characteristics and specificitis of such antibodies can be used to guide the development of HIV-1 vaccine candidates capable of eliciting protective humoral immunity in a target population. Current methods for study of these antibodies include isolation of antibodies from memory B cells, which may not always reflect the antibodies circulating in the blood. Our research has focused on the identification of characterization of the broad neutralizing antibodies directly from patient serum (without potential bias of selection), as neutralizing antibody characteristics seen in multiple individuals are more likely be raised in a broad population. We have noted particular biochemical signatures that point to a common dominant, acidic epitope that is targeted on the envelope of HIV. Objectives: The specific hypothesis of this proposal is that the broad HIV-1 neutralizing response in plasma is due to a shared acidic epitope on the gp120 envelope. The specific aims of the project are to 1) Directly isolate and sequence the antibodies responsible for the broad neutralization from the plasma of HIV-1 infected individuals, and 2) Map the corresponding epitope(s) of the broad neutralizing antibodies to test the hypothesis that a shared acidic epitope of gp120 is responsible for the broad HIV-1 neutralization response. Methods: We have identified 10 patients with broad neutralization, of which 3 will be studies in detail. The affinit purification (antigen, subclass, and light chain specific) and fractionation (free-flow isoelectric focusing) scheme can narrow the antibodies of interest, directly, from the plasma to individual species. These species will be tested for broad neutralization. Upon confirmation, the individual antibody bands will be sequenced de novo using both LC-MS and Edman degradation (N-terminal and internal sequencing). Epitope mapping of the new mAbs will be undertaken with Elisa, mutagenesis studies, and X-ray crystallography. Once the epitope is identified, Elisa and mutagenesis studies will be used to test the active fraction on the other 7 individuals to determine if this epitope is responsible for broad neutralization. Findings: Anticipated results wil be isolation of new mAbs, identification of common characteristics of broadly neutralizing abs, and the identification of a common acidic epitope that can direct broad HIV-1 neutralization. Status: We have completed enough work on the techniques described herein (as well as each alternative plan) to ensure that the aims are feasible and will be completed. Impact: If our hypothesis proves correct, then the results will be novel and directly applicable to the study of HIV vaccines. This study will provide a deeper understanding of possibilities of the broad HIV-1 neutralizing response in humans, and it will also have identified a naturally occurring epitope(s) that can be the target of potent cross-clade antibodies against HIV-1. This will have an impact on the designs of an HIV vaccine, which when developed will improve the health of veterans by preventing this life-long disease."

"9309455","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Offspring of parents with bipolar disorder (?at-risk youth?) are at increased risk for the development of psychopathology. Many of these at-risk youth have elevated mood lability, frequent and severe changes in mood state, which contributes to poor functioning and increases risk for mood disorder. However, not all individuals at familial risk develop psychiatric disorders, and in this project we explore the compensatory networks that could help to explain individual differences in risk. Several lines of evidence indicate that neural circuitry supporting working memory (WM) might act as such a compensatory network, and that better working memory capacity (WMC) in particular is associated with better emotion regulation and less mood lability. The objective of this project is to better understand the neural circuitry of mood lability, and to then assess potential compensatory neural mechanisms in youth at risk for bipolar disorder (BD). We propose to first assess differences between at-risk and healthy youth in the activation and functional connectivity (FxC) of ventral networks involved in cognitive reappraisal of emotion, and whether the individual differences in these networks correlate with degree of mood lability in the at-risk youth. We next evaluate if a greater WMC (and FxC of the central executive network, central to WM) might compensate for these ventral abnormalities, and thus might be associated with less mood lability in at-risk youth. To provide a probe of the directionality of this relationship, we conduct a pilot manipulation of WM training (5 weeks) in a subset of at-risk, labile youth. Identification of such a compensatory network in at-risk youth would provide a target for preventive measures in these youth, and pave the way for future studies investigating strategies for building resilience.  In concert with this research plan, training goals will provide the Principal Investigator with a skillset necessary to further pursue this line of research: specifically, training in developmental cognitive neuroscience, the implementation of neuroimaging studies in pediatric populations, and sophisticated analysis of neuroimaging data. To obtain this training, the PI has assembled a mentorship team with expertise in relevant areas, most notably, her mentor Dr. Mary Phillips (neuroimaging in BD) and co-mentor Dr. Boris Birmaher (implementation of studies of youth with BD). She has also designed a detailed training plan, which includes formal collaborations with consultants, coursework, and workshops. Research and training activities will primarily occur at the University of Pittsburgh, an institution with a commitment to research in pediatric BD, as well as affective and cognitive neuroscience, and a strong track record for supporting the career development of junior faculty. This training will build on the PI?s existing background as a child psychiatrist with a strong knowledge of statistics and clinical neuroscience, to provide her will the necessary skills to become an independent investigator. Her long-term research goal is to better characterize the neurodevelopmental trajectory of BD in youth, and develop strategies for building resilience in those who are at risk for disorder."
"9453205","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Both human epidemiologic data and animal studies suggest that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with an increased risk for developing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). Vitamin D deficiency is increasingly prevalent worldwide, and may promote IBD in genetically susceptible individuals through changes in immune responses, gut epithelial barrier function, and/or the composition of the gut microbiome. While it is clear that diet plays a role in shaping the microbiome, the influence of individual micronutrients, such as vitamin D, remains largely unexplored. In this application I will further elucidate the mechanisms through which vitamin D modulates the intestinal environment to suppress inflammation by using a mouse model that develops IBD and colon cancer. Smad3-/- mice have dysregulated transforming growth factor ? signaling, a pathway frequently affected in human IBD and colon cancer patients, and develop colitis when infected with a gut bacteria, H. bilis. Previous work in our laboratory has demonstrated that supplementing dietary vitamin D significantly reduces colitis and subsequent inflammation-associated colon cancer in Smad3-/- mice. We hypothesize that elevated dietary vitamin D suppresses bacterial-induced colonic inflammation through its effects on adaptive immune cells (likely T lymphocytes) and/or intestinal epithelial cells during the initial stages of disease development. We will explore this hypothesis using mice lacking vitamin D receptor signaling in specific cell populations. In addition to changes in immune and epithelial cell populations, our preliminary data suggest that increased dietary vitamin D alters the gut microbiota, which likely impacts the development of IBD in our model. We will therefore characterize the changes in colonic microbiota induced by supplemental vitamin D and will evaluate potential mechanisms inducing these changes. Together these studies will provide substantial insights into the mechanisms through which vitamin D ameliorates IBD. In addition to having direct translational impacts on human health, these studies will allow me obtain cutting edge training in mucosal immunology and microbiome analysis, as well as advanced multidisciplinary bioinformatics and statistics training. I will obtan state-of-the-art knowledge in these fields of study through a mentoring team of experts in these fields and through a training program that includes didactic instruction and hands-on experiments. My career goal is to become an independent research scientist with experience in studying gastrointestinal diseases. I propose to study the interactions between diet, gut microbiota, and intestinal disease, which is an important developing area of medical research. Moreover, the training I will obtain through these studies will lay a foundation for long-term success as a research scientist. My training in veterinary lab animal research, combined with the expertise I will gain from this research project will provide me with a sound and flexible basi to continue my research career in biomedical research and will directly facilitate my transition to research independence."
"9266679","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Cardiomyopathies and arrhythmia are conditions with high morbidity and limited therapies. Although a vast number of genes have been discovered to contribute to the etiology of these diseases, translational research- the practical application of genetic knowledge to improve screening, diagnosis, and treatment for affected individuals and their families-has been limited. One major obstacle is the lack of functional studies to understand the relationship between genotype and emergent phenotype at multiple physiological scales (cells to tissues) and to identify factors that cause clinical variability between and within families. The proposed study focuses on three affected families each with different mutation in the Lamin A/C (LMNA) gene. LMNA encodes the main protein of the nuclear lamina, the structural matrix of the nuclear envelope that interacts with both the cell nucleus and cytoskeleton. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that LMNA mutations are associated with defects in the structure, organization, and function at multiple length-scales. Between families, the severity of the defects is associated with the type of LMNA mutation; and within families, severity is modified by additional genetic factors. Our long term goals are to develop in vitro disease models directly from patients to understand how proper cell structure, tissue organization, and contractile function are affected by the mutation and genetic modifiers. In Specific Aim 1, we will use exome sequencing and in vitro tissue engineering techniques to evaluate genomic variation and defects in cell and nuclear morphology, intracellular architecture, motility, and tissue self-assembly and architecture in fibroblasts from LMNA patients and controls. In Specific Aim 2, we will derive induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) from fibroblasts and analyze cell structure and tissue organization of iPS-derived cardiomyocytes from LMNA patients and controls. In Specific Aim 3, we will use RNA sequencing to test for altered gene expression and the Heart-on-a-Chip to characterize contractility function (frequency, systolic, diastolic, and twitch stresses) of iPS-derived cardiomyocytes from LMNA patients and controls. These results combined with information of genetic and phenotypic variances will imply pathways and functionalities we will further study. Understanding of the complex relationship between genotype and emergent phenotype and identifying modifying factors will provide insight into the mechanism of heart disease and may assist in the development of new preventative, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies."
"9272411","The development of the core facilities has been a learning experience for the PI of the NO INBRE. The major lesson learned since initial funding of the NO INBRE is that in a low population, large land mass state with a limited investigator base, one must develop core facilities that provide services that cannot be purchased through commercial entities. This certainly applies to flow and cell sorting since there is no other facility capable of sorting cells in the entire state of North Dakota. Likewise, it is very difficult, if not impossible, to perform flow through commercial entities or at academic centers distant from one's home laboratory. This is especially true for the sorting of cells, where in most instances immediate processing and/or culture of the product is necessary. A prime example of this situation is in the cutting-edge technology of stem cells, where research in this area is difficult, if not impossible, without the ability to sort and capture the resulting cells for culture and/or analysis. The NO INBRE has identified this core as essential for the further development of research, teaching and service in NO. Simply stated, at some juncture in their undergraduate career, every undergraduate student destined to enter the graduate student or health professional pipeline should have been exposed to flow and cell sorting. The same is true for graduate students destined for postdoctoral fellowships and medical students progressing to residencies."
"9301573","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary goal of the proposed Center of Excellence is to build a powerful and scalable Knowledge Engine for Genomics, KnowEnG.

"9270050","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The scientific aims of our COBRE have been to increase our understanding of reproductive biology and cardiopulmonary development, to enhance our understanding of perinatal diseases, like preeclampsia and preterm birth, and to develop new opportunities for novel therapeutic strategies. Our research focus during Phase I and Phase II has been driven by recognition that the fundamental mechanisms that regulate embryonic development, cancer, and aging are overlapping. The success of our projects has been enhanced by the common view that looking through this prism of development provides unique experimental leverage and testable hypotheses for how regulatory pathways are governed later in life. The programmatic aims of the COBRE have been to create a Center for Perinatal Biology providing scientific and career mentoring to junior faculty within an environment fostering creativity and transdisciplinary collaboration. During Phase III of the COBRE for Perinatal Biology, our objectives will be: 1) continued support of COBRE-related activities; 2) transition the Center to sustainability; and 3) enhance perinatal and developmental research at Women & Infants Hospital. Resources for the Research Core programs will be used to upgrade existing instrumentation to enhance our research sophistication. The Pilot Grants Program associated with the Phase-III COBRE will be used to stimulate collaborative research efforts that will contribute to joint applications among the investigators and sustaining resources  for the Core Facilities. The Specific Aims we have identified to accomplish these goals are: Specific Aim 1: Provide Overall Leadership supporting the Administrative Core's ability to manage the operations and to transition the COBRE for Perinatal Biology into a sustainable Center for Perinatal Biology toward long-term sustainability. Specific Aim 2: Develop a sustainable, state-of-the-art Research Core that maximizes the use and impact of contemporary approaches, equipment, and technology for Perinatal Research. Specific Aim 3: Utilize Pilot Grants Program resources to catalyze multi-disciplinary research leading to additional extramural awards in Perinatal Research."
"9268660","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The following Goals are designed to achieve the overarching Strategic Goal to construct a rich multiscale atlas of human alveolar development and to readily share the resulting materials with other research centers in the UO1 and with the broad research community. Goal 1. Make a digital map of alveolar development over time in vivo and in tissue pieces using novel micro- CT (uCT), micro MRI (uMRI) and Phase contrast X-ray (PCX) technology validated in mice and then in human lung tissue. Goal 2. Make a digital map of spatiotemporal gene expression during alveolar development over time using newly modified high throughput multiplex ISH with novel slice and dice, Vibra-SSIM confocal technology, in mouse and human lung tissue. Goal 3. Make a digital map of the fine structure of alveolar matrix during development in mouse and human tissue. Goal 4. Develop image-processing technology to meld digital multiscale images of alveolar structure with cell autonomous gene expression with extracellular matrix protein configuration into a readily navigable, annotated novel data resource for the scientific community. SOPs will be developed and process driven milestones will be set up to ensure deliverability and return on this significant scientific investment. Drs. Warburton, Shi and Driscoll are expert alveolar biologists while Drs. Fraser, Moats and Lansford are expert imaging scientists who are adept at recording, registering and assembling digital, multiscale combinatorial maps of organ development in Drosophila and Mouse and have invented many novel and highly innovative techniques to do so. Overall impact on human health: Human and mouse lung are fundamentally structurally different (reviewed in Warburton et al, 2010). Length of gestation, lobation, airway branch pattern, number of airway branches, proximo-distal airway epithelial differentiation and alveolar epithelial and capillary surface area as well as alveolar epithelial cell number differ in importan respects between mouse and human. Not least, alveolarization begins postnatally in mice, yet begins in utero in humans. We propose eventually to translate our novel concepts on alveolar development derived in mice rapidly to studies in vivo in humans. We hope that this fundamental knowledge will eventually be useful for the prevention and treatment of alveolar hypoplasia, such as occurs in bronchopulmonary dysplasia of the human premature neonate, as well as potentially to informing regeneration of alveolar tissue or amelioration or reversal of alveolar degeneration in older children, adolescents and adults with lung diseases.

"9353272","7. PROJECT SUMMARY Understanding how human cells organize, shape, and move their membrane-bound organelles is one of the most fundamental problems in biology. To address this challenge, my laboratory studies how the actin and microtubule cytoskeletons control membrane remodeling and organelle dynamics. As cells age, their ability to properly regulate these processes changes. This is especially true for kidney cells and immune cells, as a variety of renal and inflammatory diseases develop with age. However, the differences in cytoskeletal functions that give rise to these cellular changes during the aging process are poorly understood. In human cells, actin filament networks are assembled by proteins called nucleation factors from the Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome Protein (WASP) family. Despite their importance in remodeling membranes during a wide range of processes, these nucleation factors have not been well characterized, especially as they relate to aging and mechanisms of human disease. I have a long-standing interest in determining how the cytoskeleton drives membrane dynamics in normal cells, and how these functions are altered in the context of infectious and genetic diseases. The immediate goal of this Career Development Award is to allow me to initiate another avenue of investigation on the role of the cytoskeleton in cell aging so that I can achieve my long-term goal of leading a lab which studies cytoskeletal functions in health, aging, and disease. These goals will be achieved by completing four specific aims: (1) Define roles for actin nucleation factors and regulators of autophagy in kidney disease, including Nephrocerebellar Syndrome (NCS); (2) Determine functional links between the cytoskeleton, autophagy, cytokine secretion, and inflammation during infection and aging; (3) Deepen my training in the biology of aging through collaborative training experiences at the Jackson Laboratory's Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging and at the Center on Aging at the UConn Health Center; (4) Develop into an independent investigator in the basic biology of cell aging. Given my expertise in cytoskeletal biology, plus my existing grant on the role of actin nucleation in autophagy and disease, my lab is uniquely positioned to provide key mechanistic insights into the relationships among actin nucleation factors, autophagy, kidney function, inflammation, and aging."
"9275371","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         We have demonstrated that LTBR-pathway blockade has therapeutic effects in NOD mice, a popular model of Sjogren's syndrome. Affymetrix analysis, ELISA and q-PCR analyses showed that CXCL13 increased with disease progression in glands, but was reduced ~5-fold by LTBR-pathway inhibition. Our own preliminary data and a recent report that LTass2 expressed by DC drives most if not all of the LTBR-dependent events in lymph nodes [1] suggest that DC play a critical role in induction of HEV, CXCL13 and gland pathology in Sjogren's syndrome. Until now the evidence connecting DC, HEV, CXCL13 and disease progression is only circumstantial but herein we propose to deplete DC, or to silence LT-ass2 expression by DC, and thus definitively verify or refute this concept. We also will determine if dendritic cells are the direc source of CXCL13, a chemokine well known to drive ectopic lymphoid follicles and B-lymphocyte accumulation in diseased glands of mice and man, and evaluate the result of CXCL13 neutralization on disease progression. Our primary goal is to determine definitively whether or not expression of LTass2 by a dendritic cell subset orchestrates much of the pathology in exocrine glands that is associated with reduced gland function and altered gene expression. Aim 1. Determine if direct neutralization of CXCL13 might serve as a therapy in Sjogren's syndrome by interrupting ectopic follicle formation and B-cell accumulation in diseased glands. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody will be used to treat NOD mice in a therapeutic manner. Histology, immunolocalization studies, real- time PCR, Affymetrix chip analyses, direct measurement of the rate of salivary and lacrimal gland secretions and ocular integrity scores will be used to assess the efficacy of direct CXCL13 ablation as a therapeutic target in the NOD mouse model of Sjogren's syndrome. Off target effects on immune responses will be examined. Aim 2. Determine the sources of CXCL13 in lacrimal glands using CXCL13-GFP mice backcrossed to NOD background and/or in situ hybridization and isolation of infiltrating cells by cell-sorting with a FacsAria III. Determine the kinetics, localization, abundance and phenotype of cd11c+ dendritic cell populations of glands of NOD during disease development and progression. Isolation by fluorescent cell sorting, multicolor FACS analyses, real-time PCR, ELISA assays, multicolor fluorescence microscopy and other methods will be employed to define DC populations present in diseased glands at various stages of disease and determine if these dendritic cells are a direct source of CXCL13 and express LTass2, the ligand for LTBR. Aim 3. Determine whether depletion of all CD11c DC or DC-specific ablation of certain gene products (lymphotoxin-alpha, CXCL13) alters the onset or progression of disease or alters the size and nature of the leukocyte infiltrates in in salivary and lacrimal glands in transgenic NOD mouse strains we will create by backcrossing. We will utilize existing mouse strains, namely (1) CD11c-diptheria toxin receptor-NOD mice (NOD.FVB-Tg(Itgax-DTR/EGFP)57Lan/JdkJ), (2) NOD mice, and (3) bone marrow chimeras of various NOD- background transgenic mouse strains. We will create strains in 1.5 years by Simple Sequence Length Polymorphism-assisted speed-backcrossing (cd11c-DTR/NOD, LTalpha-/-/NOD, CXCL13-/-/NOD). These will be used to determine whether dendritic cells provide critical signals via the lymphotoxin-beta receptor pathway to drive HEV development, leukocyte accumulation, chemokine production and gland hypofunction."
"9418364","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Everyday memory decisions (e.g., Is that the neighbor's son crossing the street?) may benefit from cues from the environment (e.g., I am near his elementary school, therefore it is likely to be him). Although both adults and children are faced with situations where external information can be helpful, virtually no research has investigated the emergence of this skill and very little research has examined the neural mechanisms underlying its development. Most developmental literature investigating the influence of external context focuses on the negative consequences resulting from inaccurate or misleading information in the domain of eyewitness testimony. However, a comprehensive understanding of the interaction between memory and decision-making requires not only that one investigates these negative consequences, but also the adaptive nature of incorporating reliable external information. The current proposal will investigate: the emergence and development of adaptive recognition biases (Aim 1), and the developmental differences in neural activation accompanying adaptive memory biasing (Aim 2).  Prior research demonstrates that adults can adaptively bias decisions when provided with reliable external cues (reading Likely Old or Likely New on the screen) during a recognition test. Critically, although these external cues are frequently valid, a small proportion of trials are invalidly cued (e.g., a novel item presented after a Likely Old cue). Functional imaging data demonstrate that fronto-parietal regions are particularly important for overcoming invalidly cued expectations and three specialized activation patterns occur dependent on whether the item is generally unexpected, unexpectedly familiar, or unexpectedly novel. Since frontal and parietal regions continue to develop structurally and functionally into young adulthood, it is important to determine the putative role of these regions in adaptive memory biasing throughout development.  The proposed research will investigate the emergence and development of adaptive memory biases behaviorally by having various age groups (ages 5-14) complete a cued recognition task where reliable external cues reading Likely Old or Likely New appear before each recognition probe. We predict that children ages 9 and older will appropriately incorporate external cues and that this skill will continue to improve throughout development. Younger children are expected to respond to the cues, but not adaptively. We predict 5 year-olds will over-rely on external cues while 7 year-olds will begin to show some ability to incorporate cues for correct recognition but not correct rejections. We will also investigate neural activity accompanying memory biases using functional magnetic resonance imaging with children ages 9 and older, with the prediction that younger age groups will demonstrate a reduction in one or more of the specialized responses seen in adults. Overall, the proposed research advances our understanding of memory and decision-making processes during healthy development and can also help inform research where memory development is atypical."
"9345176","ABSTRACT An estimated 10-30% of the 21.8 million HIV-infected adults in sub-Saharan Africa have hypertension, the single largest risk factor for cardiovascular disease (CVD). The consequences of untreated hypertension are magnified in HIV-infected individuals who are at 50% greater risk of experiencing a CVD event than HIV- uninfected persons, even after controlling for traditional CVD risk factors. Although the scale up of HIV treatment means that millions of patients are now in contact with the health system, poor uptake of hypertension treatment in these same populations persists. As a result, fewer than 10% of hypertensive patients on HIV treatment have controlled blood pressure. Because HIV and hypertension management share many barriers (e.g., opportunity costs of accessing care), emerging solutions for HIV treatment also represent critical opportunities to improve access to, and sustainability of, treatment for other chronic conditions in Africa. The proposed K23 study seeks to understand the implementability and effects of adding hypertension treatment into the ?community adherence group? (CAG) model for HIV treatment in Zambia. In Aim 1, we will evaluate the implementation of the hypertension care into this model by measuring adoption, fidelity of implementation, and sustainability of access to hypertension medications over time. In Aim 2, we will use a before-and-after design to evaluate the effectiveness of introduced practices on blood pressure. In Aim 3, we will use in-depth interviews and focus groups among both health care workers and patients to understand how to optimize the acceptability, fit, and reach of the model for future dissemination and eventual extension into HIV-uninfected populations with hypertension. I am currently immersed in a project supported by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation that seeks to implement and scale up the CAG model for HIV treatment in Zambia. My hands-on knowledge of CAG implementation will make the addition of a hypertension component into the CAG model immediately feasible. Findings from the scientific aims proposed will inform an R01 evaluating the dissemination of an integrated HIV and hypertension treatment CAG model and an R21 to expand the model to HIV-uninfected patients. The overarching goal of this proposed mentored career development award is to support my development into an independent implementation science researcher with a focus on health systems innovations for chronic diseases in resource-limited settings. The career development aims for this K23 are to obtain expertise in (1) the application of implementation science theory to research design and evaluation; (2) analytic methods for correlated and longitudinal data; (3) the use of qualitative methods in implementation research and (4) positioning research questions and findings to optimize influence on practice and policy. This plan will be carried out with coursework and guidance of an international team of mentors with expertise in HIV & cardiovascular disease epidemiology, implementation science, biostatistics, and mixed methods research."
"9247111","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With persons aged > 65 years representing the fastest growing segment of the U.S. population, the prevention of age-related functional decline and disability is an important public health priority. The loss of functional abilities in advanced age is associated with not only the onset of disability and the loss of independence but also with increased rates of morbidity and mortality. To date, physical exercise is the only intervention consistently demonstrated to improve physical function among older adults and is increasingly being considered the standard of care for treating functional impairments. However, significant variability exists in responsiveness to exercise. As such, many individuals do not achieve clinically-significant improvements in function despite good adherence. Accordingly, there is a need to identify adjuvant therapies capable of improving the efficacy of exercise in treating older adults with functional impairments. This application proposes conduct a pilot study to investigate the potential of resveratrol, a commercially-available nutritional product, to enhance the efficacy of physical exercise in improving physical function among older adults with functional impairments. The overarching objective of this project is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of an intervention combining resveratrol supplementation and physical exercise among sedentary persons aged > 65 years objectively-measured functional impairments. A total of 60 participants will be recruited to participate in this three month intervention study. All participants will engae in a center-based exercise program 3/days per week and will be randomly assigned to consume 1) placebo, 2) 250 mg/day resveratrol, or 3) 1000 mg/day resveratrol. This study will provide critical information regarding the influence of REX on objectively-measured and self-assessed indices of physical function. The study will also provide novel biologic information regarding the relative effects of REX on skeletal muscle mitochondrial function."
"9274910","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a growing public health problem that currently affects more than 500 million people worldwide. Given the growth of major risk factors, including obesity, hypertension and diabetes mellitus (DM), the prevalence of CKD and its consequences will continue to expand. In addition to the risk of progressing to end stage renal disease, patients with CKD suffer from premature death due to cardiovascular disease (CVD). The mortality rates in advanced CKD are six times higher than the Medicare population. Emerging data over the past decade suggest a critical role of non-traditional risk factors in the pathogenesis of CVD. These risk factors include obesity and insulin resistance (IR)-two elements not currently targeted by standard therapies. A significant knowledge gap exists detailing the main determinants of IR in this population, how to optimally characterize this derangement, and whether it can be effectively modified to improve outcomes in this population. The pathophysiology of insulin resistance in CKD is unique. In addition to a high prevalence of obesity (nearly 50%), patients with CKD have important metabolic derangements, such as decreased clearance of insulin and adipokines, metabolic acidosis, and chronic inflammation, that modify the pathophysiology of insulin resistance. Adipose tissue is an endocrine organ that secretes adipokines which include, but are not limited to, adiponectin and leptin.6 These two adipokines have opposing actions. Adiponectin is a key insulin sensitizing hormone with anti-atherogenic effects. In contrast, leptin is atherogenic and promotes insulin resistance. Leptin to adiponectin ratio (LAR) has been proposed as an atherogenic index in diabetes and has been shown to be a sensitive marker of metabolic syndrome. Furthermore, LAR has been shown to be the best correlate of IR in end stage renal disease patients. Given the high prevalence of obesity and metabolic derangements associated with CKD, detailing the interaction between these two conditions and their effect on CV risk is critical. The overarching aim of this proposal is to understand the effect of these interactions on adipokine imbalances and the generation of insulin resistance, and the combination of these effects on vascular health. Novel biomarkers, including imbalances in adipokine profiles, will be tested for their ability to risk stratify patiets. Finally, interventions directed at adipokine dysregulation and insulin resistance will be tested fo its ability to reverse this high risk profile in patients with moderate CKD. Our specific aims are s follows: 1) To characterize the metabolic disturbances that arise from the intersection of increased adiposity and decreased clearance of insulin and adipokines in obese patients with moderate CKD, 1a) To compare the extent of IR using hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp (HEGC) studies between patients with and without CKD and the degree to which this is modified by obesity, 1b) To examine if LAR will more appropriately reflect the metabolic state of obesity in the setting of moderate CKD compared to conventional measures of insulin resistance validated against HEGC, 1c) To determine if LAR is a determinant of inflammation, endothelial function, oxidative stress and atherosclerosis in the setting of obesity in CKD; 2) To study the effects of metformin, an AMP-K activator, on the metabolic disturbances associated with CKD and obesity, i.e. insulin resistance, systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, 2a) To test if metformin will improve LAR in obese CKD patients compared to placebo, 2b) To test if metformin will improve markers of systemic inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial function in this population compared to placebo. 2c) To test if metformin will improve atherosclerosis markers and reduce clinical CVD events in obese patients with moderate CKD compared to placebo. Our proposed studies could potentially impact clinical practice, by providing new monitoring tools and potential targets for intervention to reduce CV mortality in CKD patients. Our study results could have a great impact on VETERANS HEALTH CARE and contribute to the research mission of the Department of Veterans Health administration by improving the care we provide to veteran patients with CKD."
"9281536","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The goal of this project is to study the role and mechanisms by which host sphingolipids are involved in controlling the infection caused by the pathogenic fungus Cryptococcus neoformans (Cn).  A rapidly emerging area of research is the study of the role of sphingolipids in the regulation of infectious diseases (Reviewed in1). Although some sphingolipids have been linked to antibacterial activity of phagocytic cells,2,3 very little is known about the role of host sphingolipids against fungal infections. One of the host sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes shown to regulate immune responses is sphingomyelin synthase (SMS), encoded by the SMS1 and SMS2 genes.4-6 SMS transfers a choline phosphate moiety from phosphatidylcholine (PC) to ceramide, therefore producing sphingomyelin (SM) and diacylglycerol (DAG).7-9 Very interestingly, the lipids regulated by SMS have been implicated in the activation of pro-inflammatory responses, suggesting that the regulation of SMS activity in immune cells may assume a critical role in controlling infections.  In our preliminary and published studies10,11 we  found that: 1) inhibition of SMS activity profoundly impairs the ability of phagocytic cells to kil Cn cells by affecting extracellular killing in absence of phagocytosis; 2) SMS regulates production of  DAG at the Golgi; 3) DAG produced at the Golgi by SMS regulates protein secretion via activation of protein kinase D (PKD); 4) inhibition of SMS or PKD blocks extracellular killing of Cn and peptide secretion (such as defensins) by neutrophils; and 5) neutropenia significantly exacerbates Cn infection. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that SMS activity plays a key role in controlling the extracellular killing of neutrophils through the regulation of a DAG-PKD-mediated secretion pathway (Figure 1). Thus, we propose the following aims: 1) To establish the role of SMS against Cn; and 2) To determine the mechanism by which SMS regulates Cn killing.  The studies proposed in this applications are significant and novel at different levels: i) they will establish novel animal models for the study of fungal infection that  are more clinically relevant to the human infection than current models; ii) they will define the role of phagocytes in the host response to fungal infections; and iii) they will identify novel regulators of the phagocytes' response against the infection which can be engineered to boost the host immune system."
"9410945","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The association of aging with increased incidence of breast cancer is well known, but little understood. Emphasis has been placed on differences among tumors as a function of age, while considerably less attention is given to changes that occur normally in mammary epithelium during the process of aging, which may facilitate tumor genesis. Studying a unique collection of cultured strains of normal pre-stasis finite lifespan human mammary epithelial cells generated from over 47 different women we have identified fundamental changes to the mammary epithelium that take place during aging. Contrary to expectations, aging was associated with increases in the proportional size of a cKit-expressing progenitor pool, which acquired differentiation defects, thus giving rise to luminal epithelial cels that expressed proteins normally associated with myoepithelial cells in younger women; and fewer myoepithelial cells were generated. Myoepithelial cells are putatively tumor- suppressive, and progenitors are putative etiological roots of some breast cancers. Thus during the aging process the population of cells potentially targeted for transformation is increased and there is a  simultaneous decrease in tumor suppressive cells, which suggests a cellular mechanism that leads to increased vulnerability to malignant progression. We were able to draw these conclusions by correlating results of in vitro cell-based functional assays on flow cytometry enriched subsets with observations of tissues in vivo. Indeed, the developmental lineage hierarchy of human mammary epithelia as we know it has been elucidated using many of the same functional assays and work flows. Whereas that approach is excellent for proving connectedness of one subset to another, it is inefficient and difficult to identify heretofore-unknown lineages and intermediates. Here we propose to utilize a new high-dimensional cytometry method to perform lineage tracing by deep profiling as a function of age in a large collection of primary uncultured human mammary epithelia. The expected outcome of this work will be elucidation, at unprecedented detail, of age-dependent changes in lineage hierarchies in primary human mammary epithelia, and characterization of the stroma adjacent to the gland. The proposed work will positively impact the aging and cancer fields by providing a basic understanding of the progenitors and differentiated lineages that are most altered by aging. As gene expression profiling is performed on newly identified age- affected intermediates in the lineage hierarchy, we will begin to identify specific associated molecular changes, which will serve as potential early intervention, prophylaxis, and prevention targets."
"9275423","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The initial event in glucocorticoid (GC)-induced osteonecrosis, in many cases, is death of bone-synthesizing osteoblasts. Our preliminary work shows that this osteoblast death, at least in major part, is not directly caused by the GC. Bone growth and survival is regulated by many systems, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) being of critical importance. Developing osteoblasts, prominent in in high turnover bone such as femoral head trabecular bone, express the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor. We discovered that osteoblasts express VEGF strongly in response to ACTH. Continuous steroid treatment reduces ACTH to very low levels. In rabbits with high-dose GC, we showed that intermittent administration of ACTH greatly reduced osteonecrosis. Our hypothesis is that ACTH is a key regulator of bone growth and survival, particularly in regions with rapid bone turnover. However, mesenchymal stem cells or osteoblasts express VEGF receptors and ACTH receptors. Further, our pilot studies show that VEGF increases growth and differentiation or osteoblasts. Because ACTH is one of several factors that regulate VEGF production in bone, systematic study is needed to determine how ACTH, VEGF, and other regulatory pathways interact in bone.    Gaps in understanding include that downstream actions of ACTH in bone cells are poorly understood. The interactions of ACTH with other systems that regulate VEGF are unclear. These interactions may be mediated by inflammatory cells, hypoxia, or additional cell signals. It is not known whether ACTH synthesis occurs in bone. It is not known how ACTH action in bone varies with frequency or dose of ACTH administration. Aim 1 will study the mechanism of response of osteoblasts to ACTH and VEGF. To assure relevancy to human disease, study will include human cells in vitro. To determine whether ACTH provides survival signals in addition to VEGF, we will study the response of osteoblasts to VEGF, with and without ACTH. Cell proliferation and matrix synthesis will be measured, as well as production of regulatory cytokines by osteoblasts. To define the VEGF response, we will make osteoblasts with VEGF receptors -1 and -2 (ft-1 and fk-1) eliminated. This will allow ACTH effects on osteoblasts to be defined in the absence of autocrine VEGF response. Aim 2 will determine how ACTH modulates VEGF production in GC-treated bone. To determine how immune cells regulate production of VEGF by osteoblasts, we will make mixed cultures including macrophages or lymphocytes. In    addition, the Scarb1 mouse model, which has elevated ACTH at normal GC and dense bone, will be studied to determine changes to bone and vasculature in vivo. We will characterize VEGF production in culture, and determine whether VEGF regulation involves specifc cytokines, in tissue cultures and in mice. To establish the effect of hypoxia, we will compare VEGF production in 7% versus 20% oxygen in human cell cultures. Analysis will include production of key cytokines as a function of oxygen tension. To determine whether ACTH synthesis occurs in bone, we will analyze pro-opiomelanocorticoid (POMC) expression and processing in osteoblasts, lymphocytes and macrophages. Aim 3 will defne the dependency of VEGF synthesis in bone on ACTH concentration and dose interval using depot methylprednisolone acetate (MPA)-treated rabbits. Rabbits are the best in vivo model for CG-induced osteonecrosis; steroid diabetes will occur but will be controlled with insulin. Effects on VEGF production of varying IV ACTH injection, relative to depot MPA alone or no treatment, will establish concentration dependency. ACTH will be injected daily, at 8 AM, at 0.01 to 0.3 mg/kg, for 28 days. Osteonecrosis, bone turnover, serum ACTH and corticosteroids will be measured. This will establish the dose dependency of ACTH osteonecrosis suppression. To defne effect of frequency of administration on efficacy, we will compare the effects of ACTH 0.05 ?kg and 0.15 ?kg twice daily versus 0.1 or 0.3 ?kg once daily. This work will use innovative methods to defne a novel metabolic regulatory pathway in bone. It will establish new mechanisms that contribute to osteonecrosis, which may allow reduction of its occurrence."
"9268509","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The amyloid precursor protein (APP) is sequentially cleaved by ß- and ?-secretases to generate amyloid ß-peptide (Aß) in the brain - a central player in Alzheimer's disease. APP cleavage by ß-secretase-1 (BACE-1) is the rate-limiting step for production of Aß. Aß is believed to exert its toxicity on neurons while in a soluble and oligomeric state, prior to deposition as insoluble fibrils in brain. Thus, for reasons related to bth pathophysiology and therapeutics, understanding mechanisms and pathways of Aß generation from APP is a major focus of many laboratories. An intriguing aspect of Aß production is that its release is dependent upon neuronal activity - enhanced synaptic activity results in more Aß release. Though pathways involved in trafficking and cleavage of APP in neurons are of obvious importance, the vast majority of previous studies on APP/BACE-1 trafficking have been carried out in non-neuronal cells. These findings may not always be applicable to neurons, which are highly polarized and are known to have very different trafficking mechanisms. Furthermore, inferences on how neuronal activity modulates APP processing by BACE-1 require work in neurons. The prevailing view is that at presynaptic terminals, heightened synaptic vesicle recycling that accompanies high synaptic activity results in increased internalization into endosomes of APP where proteolysis by secretases take place. However, our recent studies using live neuronal imaging showed rather surprising results in that APP and BACE-1 normally traffic in distinct vesicles - perhaps preventing unabated cleavage - but converge in dendrites upon activity-induction. This led us to propose a new model whereby neuronal activity brings together APP and BACE-1 in dendrites where the two molecules interact. Only subsequently are these two molecules sorted into axons to distal terminals. Experiments in this proposal will examine a number of predictions that emanate from this working model and dissect the trafficking pathways of APP and BACE-1; revealing their relationship to amyloidogenesis and neuronal activity. Four Aims are proposed: 1) Test the hypothesis that APP and BACE-1 are first conveyed into dendrites in distinct carriers after biogenesis. 2) Determine specific neuronal subcellular site(s) of APP/BACE-1 interaction and Aß release. 3) Determine the biogenesis and molecular composition of the axonal APP/BACE-1-carrying organelle. 4) Visualize APP/BACE-1 associations in brains and in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Collectively, results from these studies will provide new insights into the trafficking pathways of APP and BACE-1 and demonstrate how neuronal activity modulates these pathways to enhance APP cleavage and Aß release."
"9268439","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed surgery training plan is an integrated critical care doctoral dissertation research project, supervised by Dr. Lyle Moldawer within the Sepsis and Critical Illness Research Center (SCIRC) at the University of Florida, College of Medicine. The program is ideally designed to equip the candidate to attain his career goals of becoming a physician-scientist. Traumatic injuries are presently the leading cause of death for persons less than 45 years of age. Severe sepsis has more than doubled since 2000, and sepsis currently represents the 11th leading cause of death, and the leading diagnosed hospitalization expense. Although trauma and sepsis patients are now increasingly surviving their initial and early insults due to improved acute medical care, unfortunately two year survivability for these patients has remained unchanged. For trauma and sepsis patients, the greatest obstacle to convalescence is now a chronic immunological disequilibrium that we have termed persistent inflammation, immunosuppression and catabolism syndrome (PICS), and the declining clinical course is characterized by a persistent acute-phase response with systemic inflammation, continuous protein catabolism (despite optimal nutrition), poor wound healing, immunosuppression, and recurrent infections. The agents activating and perpetuating PICS are unresolved, and currently there is no established paradigm to discriminate between those patients who will improve clinically within 14 days from those who will progress to PICS. Early, if not immediately after trauma and sepsis onset, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that control inflammatory pathways in the innate and adaptive immune system are likely activated by either damage associated molecular patterns [DAMPs: including endogenous mitochondrial DNA and HMGB1] and/or pathogen associated molecular patterns [PAMPs: including bacterial DNA and bacterial lipopolysaccharide] that are released into the circulation during tissue damage and bacterial infection. The objective of this proposal is to develop an early prognostic of trauma and sepsis clinical trajectory, and to gain insight into the agents activating and perpetuating PICS. The overarching hypothesis is that a time-dependent circulatory load of PAMPs and DAMPs dictates whether trauma and sepsis patients recover or enter PICS. Immediately following trauma and sepsis insult, a small amount of blood (less than 10ml) will be drawn from patients in the intensive care unit. Thereafter, for the duration of ICU stay, blood will be periodically drawn to determine the interactions between the immune system and the levels of DAMPs and PAMPs. Leukocyte genomic expression and PAMP levels will be measured with NanoString. DAMP levels will be measured by a combination of qPCR, ELISA, and NanoString. As DAMPs and PAMPs are thought to be associated with an increasing number of diseases, the successful completion of these studies may ultimately contribute to a better understanding of many or most human diseases."

This five year award is expected to help the candidate transition to an independent career as a clinical scientist and to expand on the candidate's background and training in pediatric pain by exploring central pain mechanisms in adolescent girls and young adult women with primary dysmenorrhea (PD). The candidate's immediate career goals are to gain training and research experience in women's health and chronic pelvic pain (specifically, dysmenorrhea), using complex pain assessment techniques designed to evaluate excitatory and inhibitory central pain processes, and salivary assessment and analysis of stress and sex hormones. Long-term career goals are to become an independent investigator with expertise in pain mechanisms related to women's health, advance the field of chronic pain by disentangling pain processes in a highly common but understudied condition (PD), and obtain data for an eventual R01 application focused on testing potential behavioral interventions for adolescents and adults with PD. The candidate has identified nationally renowned mentors as part of her mentoring team, including an expert in chronic pain in children, an obstetrician/gynecologist who specializes in pelvic pain, and a psychologist who is an authority on psychophysiological measurement of stress. Other members of the mentoring team will provide guidance in dysmenorrhea and the relationship of pelvic pain to other chronic pain conditions, and salivary assessment and analysis of stress and sex hormones. In addition to formal and informal mentoring, the candidate is located at a nationally recognized university and hospital, such that the career development plan includes attending reproductive endocrinology didactics and clinic, classes, seminars, and meetings in obstetrics/gynecology, psychophysiology of stress, qualitative research methods, ethical considerations for research subjects, grant writing and career development, and statistical approaches to data analysis.  The candidate's proposed research involves comparing adolescent and young adult girls (ages 16-21) with and without PD during each of 3 phases of the menstrual cycle (menstruation, ovulatory, luteal) across a variety of standardized experimental pain testing paradigms designed to evaluate pain sensitivity and central excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms. The specific aims for this project are: 1) to confirm previous findings of enhanced pain sensitivity in women with PD, 2) to evaluate differences in central excitatory and inhibitory pain modulation in women with and without PD, and 3) to test for differences in autonomic nervous system (ANS) and hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) responses to pain in AYAs with and without PD, and 4) to assess the role of psychological factors (depression, anxiety, and emotion regulation) in relation to pain responses in both groups. This innovative study uses recently developed pain paradigms to better understand how and why adolescents and women with PD experience pain. In addition, this study is the first of its kind to explore pain responses in PD across the developmental spectrum, which has the potential to identify individuals at risk for the development of future chronic pain problems and inform new interventions and prevention strategies. The training and experience gained from the candidate's proposed research and career development plan will provide the critical early career support necessary for the candidate to fully develop as a successful independent researcher capable of obtaining extramural funding and establishing a long-term research career in women's health and pain."
"9272298","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The SHARE-Israel Project is an NIA/NIH supported panel survey of adults aged 50 and older that has collected three waves of data since 2005 (N=2,591). It is the Israeli component of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe, a multidisciplinary, cross-national longitudinal data base that is harmonized with the Health and Retirement Study and its sister surveys. Thus far, the SHARE-Israel survey has added distinctive measures of the effects of delayed retirement, cumulative lifelong trauma and exposure to falling missiles, to the array of topics that are covered in the HRS/SHARE domain. The overall aim of the current project is to extend the analytic potential of the SHARE-Israel survey. Specifically, the project will: 1) add two further waves of data collection (in 2015-16 and 2017-18), 2) carry out cohort refreshment to maintain cross-sectional representation of the sample, 3) implement the collection of dried blood spots (DBS), 4) apply a newly designed ego-centered name-generating social network inventory, 5) enhance further examination of measures that are germane to social life in Israel and are of interest to American and international researchers and 6) test the use of Day Reconstruction Method (DRM), as will be done in the larger SHARE Project as part of the NIA strategy to harmonize the measurement of well-being across the globe, and to apply this approach to the full sample of SHARE-Israel in its fifth Wave, in 2017. The proposed extension is significant insofar as panel studies constitute the principal mechanism by which to identify varying trajectories toward good health in older age and they are the main apparatus through which to measure the impact of interventions, personal and/or societal, on the health of aging populations. Among the innovations in the current project is the collection of four biomarkers from the DBS samples: HbA1c, total cholesterol, C-reactive protein and Vitamin D. (Vitamin D is not yet produced in the HRS DBS collection). Paired with the rich socio-economic database of SHARE, the biomarker data will shed new light on the relations between chronic conditions common in old age and risk factors under various socio-economic conditions. In addition, the application of the new social network inventory will allow better understanding of network dynamics and will allow unique examination of their linkage with transfer behaviors (time and money). Implementation of the network inventory in the SHARE-Israel survey will also allow examination of the associations between named confidants and a wide range of sociodemographic, health and other variables. Yet another area of inquiry that will be enhanced as a result of extending the SHARE-Israel panel concerns the concomitants of difficult life events, harsh threats to one's health and risk of death, and their relation to healt outcomes over time, controlling for the many sociodemographic factors that are available in the data base. The SHARE-Israel data also provide analytic opportunities for examining the effect of immigration, and particularly late-life immigration, on health and health-related behaviors and outcomes."
"9210532","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The objective of our study is to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the sexually dimorphic effects of early life stress (ELS) on pain perception in female veterans. Our overarching hypothesis is that exposure to adversity in early life predisposes female veterans to heightened visceral pain via a central mechanism involving abnormalities in brain-gut communication. RESEARCH PLAN: Under Specific Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that stress in early life serves as a risk factor for heightened pain in adulthood produced by chronic stress. Having identified in preliminary experiments increases in stress-responsive genes within the central nucleus of the amygdala (CeA) of female rats exposed to ELS, in Specific Aim 2 we will test the hypothesis that heightened pain perception in adulthood following ELS is mediated by central increases in stress-responsive genes. Specific Aim 3 will explore the hypothesis that centrally driven epigenetic changes make an individual more susceptible to chronic stress and contribute to the sexually dimorphic effects of ELS on pain perception in adult female rats. METHODOLOGY: We will employ validated rats models that recapitulate visceral pain in patients. Specifically, we will measure colonic sensitivity by quantifying the number of abdominal cramps in response to colonic distension. Stress in early life will be induced by odor shock conditioning in neonatal rat pups. Stress in adulthood will result from repeated exposure for 1 hour each day to a water avoidance stressor (WAS). We will investigate whether ELS serves as a predisposing risk factor for heightened visceral pain in response to chronic WAS in adulthood. We also will investigate whether knockdown of amygdaloid gene expression using specific antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) inhibits the development of pain following ELS. Finally we will use an array of epigenetic approaches targeting histone acetyltransferases within the CeA to gain further mechanistic insight into stress-induced visceral pain. ANTICIPATED RESULTS: For Specific Aim 1 we expect to show that rats experiencing adult stress will have visceral hypersensitivity compared to controls. However, we anticipate that that there will be a greater visceral sensitivity to the adult stress following ELS. We also expect an exaggerated activation of the HPA axis indicated by an elevated systemic CORT and ACTH, as well as increased fecal pellet output (FPO) in response to WAS in all experimental groups, however the magnitude of the change will be greater in response to ELS. For Specific Aim 2, we anticipate that imbalances of stress responsive genes contribute to abnormal visceral pain perception in adulthood following ELS. In experiments proposed under specific aim 3 we expect to show that heightened visceral pain following ELS may be modulated through epigenetically mediated mechanisms within the CeA. RELEVANCE TO VETERANS HEALTH: The VA provides specialized health care for female veterans, however limited research has focused on illnesses experienced by female Veterans. Of importance to this proposal, female veterans with anxiety-related disorders have higher rates of childhood abuse. Our findings may identify novel approaches to improve the treatment of pain in female Veterans."
"9275329","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         70 million Americans suffer from some sort of sleep disorder. Behavior, mood and memory deteriorate with sleep loss and it gets worse with continuing sleep deprivation. There is considerable amount of data on arousal neurons whereas very little is known about the neurons that make us fall asleep. Indeed, current network models of sleep-wake regulation list many arousal neuronal populations compared to only one sleep group located in the preoptic area. Better hypnotics will emerge if there was direct evidence linking specific phenotypes of neurons to sleep. To provide this evidence, we will use optogenetics to selectively manipulate sleep- active neurons. One group of sleep-active neurons is located in the preoptic area and contains galanin. Using galanin-Cre mice, the gene for the light-sensitive excitatory opsin, channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2), or the inhibitory opsin, enhanced Archaerhodopsin (eArch3.0), will be inserted into the galanin neurons and effects on sleep measured. Galanin neurons in the preoptic area will be optogenetically stimulated or inhibited during the night or day and under conditions that alter the animal's internal drive to stay awake (24h fasting) or sleep (6h sleep deprivation). In the same mouse, the second group of sleep-active neurons located in the lateral hypothalamus that contain melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) will be stimulated/inhibited with light. Recently, we published data indicating that stimulation of the MCH neurons robustly increases both non-REM and REM sleep. Now that there are two sleep- active neuronal groups it is necessary to simultaneously activate/inhibit both groups, or activate one while inhibiting th other to determine potency of each to sleep. To demonstrate that the stimulated neurons release the peptide an ELISA assay will be used to detect galanin and MCH in the CSF after 6h of optogenetic stimulation. Separate electrophysiology studies will directly monitor neuronal activity in the brain and determine the pattern of activity as the sleep-inducing signal propagates across the network. Does stimulation of the preoptic sleep-active neurons activate the distally located MCH sleep-active neurons? Do neurons adjacent to the stimulation site respond earlier or at the same time as distal arousal neurons? What is the temporal response of specific sleep versus wake neurons to the stimulation and to the emergence of sleep? Such brain activity maps are essential to identify functional connectivity and are consistent with the Brain Activity Map Project. From a translational perspective these studies are potentially useful in sleep disorders, such as insomnia, where sleep needs to be triggered against a strong arousal drive. These aims will provide a framework for integrating the sleep-active neurons within an overall model of sleep- wake regulation."
"9275384","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most frequent cancer worldwide and despite optimized cytotoxic therapies, the 5-year survival rate of metastatic disease remains poor. Novel targets and therapies are clearly needed for disseminated disease. Receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) are attractive cancer targets due to: 1) frequent deregulation via mutation, amplification and/or autocrine/paracrine activation, 2) proximal positioning in oncogenic signal pathways and 3) specific targeting by small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and inhibitory antibodies. To date, targeted therapies have not been effectively applied to HNSCC due, in part, to paucity of information on the dominant oncogene drivers. While the inhibitory EGFR antibody, cetuximab, is approved for use in HNSCC, overall effects are modest, likely due to failure to select for EGFR-addicted HNSCCs and/or rapid acquisition of resistance. While genomic approaches provide new information regarding tumor suppressors relevant to HNSCC, frequently mutated oncogene drivers were not generally identified. This observation raises the question of whether targeted therapeutics can, in fact, be successfully applied to this cancer. Our published findings identify a subset of HNSCC cell lines that is highly sensitive to FGFR inhibitors as well as a subset that is sensitive to EGFR-specific TKIs. In addition, our published and preliminary findings reveal putative roles for FGFRs in acquired resistance to EGFR-specific inhibitors. Together, these results support a hypothesis that an FGFR autocrine pathway is a dominant oncogene driver in a subset of HNSCCs. Moreover, specific FGFRs are candidates for acquired or intrinsic resistance mechanisms to EGFR inhibitors in HNSCC. To test these hypotheses, we will complete these Aims: Aim 1. Define the active FGFRs and FGFs that function as drivers in HNSCC cell lines and in primary HNSCC tumors directly propagated in nude mice. Also, the prevalence of FGFR pathway expression in archived HNSCC tumors will be defined. We will test the hypothesis that FGFR1 and specific FGFs and proteoglycan co-receptors are components of an oncogene driver pathway that functions in a clinically relevant fraction of head and neck tumors. Aim 2. Define FGFR-dependent and novel mechanisms of resistance to EGFR inhibitors in HNSCC. Our studies show rapid induction of FGFR2 and FGFR3 in EGFR- dependent HNSCC cells following treatment with EGFR-specific inhibitors as well as slower adaptive induction of FGFR1 and FGF2 during acquired resistance of EGFR-dependent HNSCC cell lines to gefitinib. We hypothesize that the failure of EGFR-targeted therapies to provide long-term control of HNSCC is due to multiple auxiliary growth pathways that reduce efficacy of EGFR inhibition alone. Completion of these specific aims is anticipated to unveil FGFR pathways as novel therapeutic targets in HNSCC. The ongoing early clinical development of multiple FGFR inhibitors could set the stage for their rapid application to this cancer that is highly relevant to the veteran population."
"9283272","Project Summary The UC San Francisco Department of Surgery, in collaboration with the Department of Bioengineering and Therapeutic Sciences, proposes to establish an interdisciplinary R25 research education program in clinical and translational ?Biodevice Innovation? for surgical residents. Surgeons possess extensive knowledge of anatomy, are intimately familiar with the needs of their patients and the limitations of current technology, and possess strong problem solving abilities developed out of the necessity to constantly improvise solutions in the operating room. However, the declining levels of NIH-funded surgeon-investigators necessitates structural changes in surgical training programs and the introduction of innovative approaches in order to engage more surgeons in research. Device innovation is becoming increasingly recognized as a research area in which surgeons can make significant creative contributions that profoundly impact patient care. Designed for surgical residents interested in careers as clinician-innovators, the proposed program would provide hands-on research experiences for residents during their two dedicated research years to work alongside prominent faculty innovators from Surgery, Bioengineering, Radiology, and other relevant clinical disciplines to develop and translate novel device-based solutions for unmet clinical needs. In the process, participants will develop the requisite bioengineering research skills, knowledge of the medical product development process, and mentor relationships to help launch their own research careers, successfully compete for grant funding, and successfully engage in device innovation as independent surgeon-scientists. The leadership team has a multi- year history of collaboration translating advances in bioengineering into innovative new treatment paradigms and breakthroughs in clinical care through successful programs such as the FDA-sponsored UCSF Pediatric Device Consortium and UCSF's Surgical Innovations Initiative. Many of the key elements of the program are already in place, including ties to the UCSF-UC Berkeley Joint Graduate Group in Bioengineering, the UCB- UCSF Master of Translational Medicine Program, the UCSF-Stanford Center of Excellence in Regulatory Science & Innovation (CERSI), and a robust infrastructure supporting device innovation at UCSF. The training program is supported by an outstanding mentorship team including faculty internationally renowned for their achievements in device innovation."
"9268533","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies are aging-related neurodegenerative diseases that are representative of a significant impending economic and treatment burden for the US healthcare system that will only increase as the population shifts to a more aged demographic. These diseases are characterized by the pathological accumulation of abnormally modified tau proteins, which is closely linked to their observed cognitive deficits. Since the underlying causes of tauopathies remain unknown, it is accordingly difficult to develop effective therapeutic interventions. Some of the earliest pathological changes, especially in AD, follow a dying-back pattern in which axons are the first to exhibit abnormal structural changes. A likely pathogenic factor contributing to axonal degeneration is the protein tau, as it is critical in maintaining axonal function. Indeed, studies using human tissue and animal model systems suggest that tau abnormalities and axonal degeneration are interconnected components of the early degenerative sequelae of AD. Our preliminary data indicate that disease-related modifications of tau that expose the amino terminus of the protein cause axonal dysfunction and degeneration in cultured neurons and in vivo. The primary goal of this proposal is to test whether disease-associated abnormalities in tau can induce axonal degeneration. Three independent specific aims are proposed to take a multifaceted approach aimed at addressing this hypothesis. Aim 1 will establish the relative contribution of tau modifications and the molecular events associated with tau-induced axon degeneration in primary cultured hippocampal neurons as well as a novel, viral vector-based rat model. Aim 2 will define the functional relationship between tau protein and enzymes linked to tau-induced axonal dysfunction (i.e. protein phosphatase 1 and glycogen synthase kinase 3?). Lastly, Aim 3 will define the relationship between abnormal forms of tau protein and axonal degeneration in the progression of human AD using post-mortem tissue from cases ranging between non-demented controls to severely demented AD. If successful, these studies will identify a molecular mechanism for tau-induced axon dysfunction/degeneration that could be targeted for disease-modifying therapeutic interventions in AD patients, as well as those suffering from other tauopathies."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The overall goal of this proposal is to significantly expand on findings from our ongoing Merit award-supported work to further interrogate gastrointestinal tract colonization and disease establishment of the diarrheagenic pathogen Clostridium difficile. To enable this project, we have identified unique bacterial factors that mediate C. difficile interaction(s) with the host intestine. Three Specific Aims are proposed. First, we will expand on our studies defining C. difficile response to, and tolerance of, reactive oxygen species and redox stress. This response severely impacts GI tract colonization of the pathogen, and highly attenuated, potential vaccine strains were generated for these studies during the current award period. Second, we will continue studies to interrogate infectious mechanism(s) of the low-toxin/high-virulence C. difficile strains we recovered from our active disease surveillance of the Southern Arizona veteran and non-veteran population. The wealth of proteomic data we have garnered will be exploited for genetic studies to define virulence and colonization mechanisms of these strains. Third, and with the goal of translating our research into an immediately clinically-relevant context, we will validate and test our newly-engineered recombinant probiotic bacterium which is a targeted C. difficile colonization inhibitor. All studies in this proposal will use existing or t-be-collected specimens from the veteran population, and utilize both hamster and mouse models of acute C. difficile infection and colonization respectively. We will also incorporate state-of-the-at methodologies including next-generation omics and sequencing, and live-animal bioluminescence imaging to interrogate various aspects of C. difficile colonization and disease establishment."
"9310291","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Gene therapy has been increasingly successful in treating several single-gene defects that cause blindness. In particular, multiple successful clinical trials for Leber's congenital amaurosis type 2 (LCA2) have utilized a 25 year-old viral delivery vehicle, based on adeno-associated virus (AAV) serotype 2, to deliver a functional copy of the rpe65 gene to the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). These trials have taken landmark strides in enhancing visual function in over 30 patients, success that has established the proof of concept that if a causative gene can be identified in a group of patients, a functional replacement gene can be packaged and safely delivered with AAV. However, as the majority of mutations underlying retinal degenerative diseases have now been identified, it has become clear that almost all encode photoreceptor-specific transcripts, establishing photoreceptors as the primary target for retinal gene therapy. Furthermore, many of these mutations are autosomal dominant, such that gene replacement strategies are not suitable.  To build upon the LCA2 trial successes, at least two major hurdles that impede broader application of retinal gene therapy must thus be overcome. First, vectors based on natural AAV variants require a subretinal of the vector to mediate gene delivery to photoreceptors or RPE, with accompanying retinal detachment with the creation of a bleb between the photoreceptors and underlying RPE. This procedure damages the retina, may exacerbate the retinal degeneration, and can induce reactive gliosis. In addition, subretinal injection limits the therapeutic effect to the area of th bleb, beyond which the AAV does not spread. Gene delivery from the vitreous would be considerably less traumatic and would offer the potential for pan-retinal transduction, both of which would represent significant advances. Since no natural AAV serotypes can transduce the photoreceptors from the vitreous in either murine or non-human primate (NHP) models, we developed and implemented a directed evolution approach that, as we have recently published, has yielded a novel AAV capable of photoreceptor transduction from the vitreous in the murine and to an extent in the NHP retina. We now propose to build upon this success and engineer AAV variants for optimal therapeutic gene delivery to the NHP retina.  A second problem with photoreceptor gene therapy is that many retinal degenerations are autosomal dominant. While RNAi can yield a partial knockdown of pathological alleles, a full ablation of such genes would be desirable. There have been recent advances in the development of site-specific DNA nucleases that can knock out target genes, and we will build upon these advances to knock out dominant alleles that underlie retinal degeneration. We thus propose a unique blend of molecular virology, protein engineering, and a translationally important animal model to engineer enhanced genetic delivery systems and cargo for treating human retinal disease."
"9370028","Staphylococcus aureus is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen involved in severe infections in humans. Most virulence determinants in S. aureus are carried on mobile genetic elements, such as plasmids, bacteriophages and genomic islands. Among these are the S. aureus pathogenicity islands (SaPIs), which carry genes encoding superantigen toxins and other virulence factors. SaPIs are normally stably integrated into the host genome, but become mobilized by specific helper phages, resulting in packaging of the SaPI genomes into transducing particles made from helper-encoded structural proteins. Many SaPIs redirect the assembly pathway of their helpers to form capsids that are smaller than those normally made by the phage.  We recently described a new class of SaPIs (including SaPIbov5) that are mobilized by prolate cos phages, which package units of DNA delimited by cos sites, rather than headfuls of DNA. The mechanism of capsid size redirection is completely different from the SaPIs that are mobilized by headful packaging phages, and depends on a SaPI-encoded capsid protein (CP) homolog called Ccm, but the process is not understood. In this developmental project we will investigate this process by a combination of staphylococcal genetics, biochemistry and high resolution cryo-EM. There are three aims: (1) Determine whether Ccm is incorporated into small phage capsids; (2) Determine structures of ?12 (large) and SaPIbov5 (small) capsids; (3) Define the roles of CP and Ccm during capsid assembly.  Upon completion of these aims, we will have gained new insights into the process of assembly in prolate phages, mobilization of cos SaPIs, SaPI evolution and the role of SaPIs in the emergence of staphylococcal virulence."

"9206091","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           More than 1,500,000 individuals in the US are diagnosed with cancer every year. Cachexia (defined as an involuntary weight loss due to adipose tissue and skeletal muscle loss), and anorexia (decreased food intake) are present in up to 80% of these patients, contributing to the decrease in functional performance, quality of life and survival seen in this setting; however, treatments for this condition are lacking. Ghrelin is a novel anabolic hormone that increases energy intake and decreases energy expenditure and inflammation leading to an increase in muscle and fat mass; although, its mechanisms of action in the setting of cancer cachexia are not fully understood. To this date, the only identify receptor for ghrelin is the growth hormone secretagogue receptor 1a (GHSR-1a) and this receptor is not present in muscle or adipose tissue. Recent data has shown that some of ghrelin's effects are GHSR-1a-independent. The objectives of this proposal are to characterize the mechanisms of action of ghrelin and GHSR-1a agonists in muscle and adipose tissue and to establish the extent to which these mechanisms are GHSR-1a-dependent in cancer cachexia. We hypothesize that ghrelin ameliorates cancer cachexia by inducing: 1) GHSR-1a- dependent increases in appetite, GH/IGF-I and downregulation of inflammation, and 2) GHSR-1a-independent decreases in proteolysis by acting directly on muscle cells. We also hypothesize that ghrelin increases lipogenesis and downregulates lipid oxidation and lipolysis in tumor-induced cachexia through GHSR-1a- dependent and independent mechanisms. Our specific aims are: 1) To determine the role of the ghrelin receptor GHSR-1a in mediating the effects of ghrelin in tumor-induced cachexia in rodent muscle. Using our already established in-vivo model (Lewis Lung Carcinoma [LLC]-induced cachexia) in GHSR-1a WT and KO mice, we will determine the role of GHSR-1a activation in modulating muscle mass and strength, inflammation, proteolysis and protein synthesis in this setting. 2) To characterize GHSR-1a-independent mechanisms of action of ghrelin in muscle. Based on our preliminary data showing that the GHSR-1a is not necessary for ghrelin to prevent cisplatin-induced proteolysis in C2C12 cells, and that ghrelin partially prevent LLC-induced cachexia in GHSR-1a KO, we will study these effects in- vivo in our LLC-induced cachexia model and in-vitro in C2C12 cells and 1ry myocyte culture from GHSR-1a KO mice. We will characterize the pathways mediating these GHSR-1a-independent effects of ghrelin and perform experiments to identify the alternate receptor responsible for these effects. 3) To establish the role of GHSR-1a in mediating the effects of ghrelin in adipose tissue. As shown in our cisplatin model, we will study the role of ghrelin in preventing fat atrophy induced by LLC tumor and the relative contribution of lipogenesis, lipolysis and lipid oxidation in this setting. Using our GHSR-1a WT and KO animals we will also establish the role of GHSR-1a in mediating ghrelin's effect in fat in-vivo and in-vitro. The development of therapies for the prevention or treatment of cancer-related fat and muscle wasting is desperately needed because they significantly reduce quality of life in Veterans with cancer. The present proposal will provide insight into ghrelin's mechanisms of action, determine which of these effects are GHSR- 1a-dependent and which are GHSR-1a-independent, characterize these two pathways and identify this novel receptor. Taken together, these experiments will determine the mechanisms mediating ghrelin's protective effects in this setting, addressing a clinical need and filling a void in the literature. Ultimately, these results will allow for better targeting of this  pathway and the development of novel therapies for this condition. Other conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure and frailty of the elderly are also associated  with muscle and fat loss and will benefit from the advance in knowledge that this proposal will bring."
"9402453","PROJECT SUMMARY Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia in the elderly, is now the third major cause of death in the United States. AD is characterized and diagnosed by distinctive neuropathological alterations including extracellular deposits of the ?-amyloid (A?) peptide intraneuronal aggregates of the microtubule associated protein tau (MAPT) and marked neuroinflammation. However, the exact mechanistic relationship between neuroinflammation and the various brain pathologies and clinical outcomes in AD remains unclear as well as the respective roles of brain resident microglia and infiltrating peripheral immune cells in these processes. Recent genetic and system biology studies have implicated multiple innate immune signaling pathways in late-onset AD. Most importantly, rare heterozygous coding mutations in TREM2, a gene exclusively expressed by myeloid cells were identified that substantially increase risk for AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. Our preliminary findings demonstrate that TREM2 is upregulated in mouse models of AD with A? pathology and human AD. Furthermore, co-localization studies demonstrated that TREM2 is selectively upregulated within myeloid cells in close proximity to A? deposits, but not in myeloid cells further away from A? deposits. Strikingly, careful flow cytometry and immunohistochemical analyses of brains from mouse models of AD revealed that TREM2 is upregulated within cells that bear markers reflective of their potential origin from circulating inflammatory monocytes. Consistent with these findings, preliminary analysis revealed an increase in TREM2+ cells in human AD blood samples. Furthermore, TREM2 deficiency in an AD mouse model leads to a virtual absence of the myeloid cells surrounding A? deposits and an overall reduction in AD-like pathologies. Finally, nuclear receptor agonists selectively target these plaque-associated TREM2+ cells and promote phagocytosis. The hypothesis to be tested in the current collaborative and interdisciplinary studies is that brain resident microglia and blood-derived TREM2+ inflammatory monocytes play distinctive roles in regulating AD pathologies that could provide novel biomarkers/diagnostics and also be targeted therapeutically. These studies will utilize state-of-the art mouse models of AD, constitutive Trem2 knockout mice, transgenic mice enabling deletion of TREM2 in various myeloid cell populations, detailed flow cytometry and genome-wide gene expression analyses as well as neuropathology and behavior to examine the three Specific Aims of the proposal:  1. Examine the Identity, Localization and Gene Expression Profiles of TREM2+ Cells in Mouse Models  and Human AD.  2. Determine the Central and Peripheral Role of TREM2 in Regulating AD Pathologies.  3. Therapeutically Targeting TREM2+ Cells"
"9271944","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is responsive to the NCI Provocative Question #9 (RFA-CA-15-008). Cognitive dysfunction (chemobrain) is an important adverse sequel of cancer chemotherapy, the study of which has been identified by the NCI as a poorly understood problem for which current management or treatment strategies are limited or ineffective. Our preliminary data show that neuronal ryanodine receptor/calcium release channels (RyR2) on the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) become oxidized and leaky in mice treated with doxorubicin or methotrexate plus 5-FU. These mice exhibit cognitive dysfunction that can be improved using a novel orally available small molecule drug (Rycal, S107) developed by the co-PI that fixes leaky RyR2 channels. The goals of this application are to: (1) establish and characterize a murine model of advanced human breast cancer that can be used to study whether intracellular calcium (Ca2+) leak via oxidized neuronal RyR2 on the ER is a novel mechanism underlying cancer chemotherapy-induced neurocognitive dysfunction; and (2) test whether the novel drug Rycal (S107) that fixes leaky neuronal RyR2 channels in vivo can prevent chemobrain. The proposed studies will have important clinical relevance as the Rycal S107 is in the same chemical class as two closely related Rycals that are currently in clinical testing for heart and muscle disorders, and to date both have excellent safety profiles. S107 has the advantage that it is concentrated >10-fold in the brain. (Although S107 is patented by Columbia University, US 8,710,045, 04/29/14, the drug is available to all investigators and the applicant receives no proceeds from its sale). This application is bolstered by preliminary data showing that commonly used chemotherapeutics cause cognitive dysfunction in C57BL6 mice that can be prevented using the Rycal S107, and by our published data showing that leaky neuronal RyR2 channels can cause stress-induced cognitive dysfunction (post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD) that can be ameliorated by oral treatment with S107. This application aims to make the novel mechanistic link between chemobrain and PTSD - intracellular Ca2+ leak - and to test a potential novel therapy that prevents this leak and prevents chemobrain."
"9237560","Project Summary Alterations in glutamate neurotransmission are recognized as an important target of pharmacotherapy for cocaine use disorders (CUDs). Our preliminary investigations with ketamine, a glutamate modulator with potent prefrontal effects, suggest sub-anesthetic infusions may work to facilitate behavioral modification by addressing critical CUD- related vulnerabilities. Alongside being safely administered to active cocaine users, we have found that sub-anesthetic ketamine, 24 hours post-infusion, significantly increases motivation to stop cocaine use by 60%, decreases cue-induced craving by a similar magnitude, and reduces the choice for cocaine now vs. money later by 67% when compared to an active control. A pilot efficacy trial also indicates that a single infusion of ketamine facilitates mindfulness-based relapse prevention (MBRP) and promotes abstinence (53% ketamine vs. 11% midazolam). Expanding on these promising but preliminary findings, this trial aims to evaluate whether ketamine promotes abstinence by facilitating behavioral modification in a treatment model approximating a general clinical setting. We will evaluate the effect of up to two outpatient sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine (0.11 mg/kg over 2 minutes, followed by 0.60 mg/kg over 50 minutes) on CUDs in 110 non-depressed individuals engaged in motivation enhancement therapy followed by MBRP. We predict that, compared to the control midazolam, ketamine will significantly promote 3 weeks of end-of-study abstinence in this 7-week trial. Secondary aims pertain to the effects of ketamine on other drug use outcomes, such as reduction in number of cocaine use days; and the evaluation of behavioral and biological mediators of ketamine efficacy, such as serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and measures of behavioral non-reactivity. If successful, this project stands to contribute significantly to the treatment of CUDs, for which there are no clearly effective pharmacotherapies at present, and has the potential to lead the field in new directions of combined medication-behavioral treatment development. Future studies might test other medications using the design introduced in this proposal, as well as focus on clarifying the mechanisms by which ketamine addresses CUDs."
"9279237","Project Summary Heart failure is a major growing public health problem with high morbidity and mortality. Despite extensive research and advances in drug development, there is still a strong demand for novel pharmacological agents that attenuate or reverse cardiac remodeling and prevent heart failure. Inflammatory mechanisms including macrophage activation and tissue fibrosis have been proposed to play an important role in cardiac remodeling and progression of heart failure. Interstitial fibrosis of viable myocardium following cardiac injury or pressure overload impairs tissue structure and behavior. Cells that are contributing to fibrosis of myocardium are primarily fibroblast and myofibroblats, which are phenotypically transformed fibroblast-like cells. Galectin-3 (a small protein) is emerging as a key player with a substantial role in the process of heart failure. It has been speculated that Galectin-3 promotes heart failure through involvement of multiple mechanisms including cardiac fibroblast proliferation, collagen deposition, and development of fibrosis. Excess collagen can potentially disturb extracellular matrix environment (ECM) resulting in alteration of spatial configuration of cardiac muscle fibers with respect to adjacent muscle elements. Alteration of muscle fiber configuration perturbs the cardiac clockwise and anticlockwise torsion, which is essential for normal pump function. Moreover, increase in myocardial collagen content could alter ventricular filling properties particularly by increasing diastolic stiffness. Clearly, an accurate assessment of left ventricular structure and function is an essential step to evaluate role of Galectin-3 inhibition in attenuating/reversing cardiac remodeling. In this study, sophisticated mathematical tools will be applied to in-vivo and ex-vivo cardiac images to identify correlation between Galectin-3 deletion and cardiac remodeling using two common murine models of heart failure (myocardial infarction and transverse aortic constriction). Immunohistochemistry techniques will be also used to evaluate Galectin-3 expression, presence of inflammatory cells (macrophages, fibroblasts and myofibroblasts), and tissue fibrosis in myocardial tissues. Outcome of this study provides novel mechanistic information that can guide the development of next generation therapeutic drugs targeting post-infarction and post-stress inflammatory response."
"9266293","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT?TRANSPLANTATION GROUP   Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement, the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology and  Transplantation (DAIT) intends to consolidate its funding for multiple, independent coordinating centers into a  single, multi-component cooperative agreement in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency and  standardization across research consortia. This new program will fund a single Center to support DAIT  research in the areas of asthma and allergic diseases, autoimmune diseases, and transplantation. In the area  of solid organ transplantation, the Center will support 4 consortia: Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation  (CTOT), Clinical Trials in Organ Transplantation in Children (CTOT-C), Genomics of Transplantation  Cooperative Research Program (GTCRP), and the organ transplantation component of the Immune Tolerance  Network (ITN). Within the Center, support for these 4 consortia will be organized under 1 group, the  Transplantation Group (TG). The objective of the TG is to provide excellent and efficient study coordination  support services across the transplant research consortia. To accomplish this objective, RhoFED aims to (1)  provide staff experienced in transplantation research conducted by DAIT-supported consortia and to organize  these staff in an administrative structure that manages resources efficiently, be responsive to the needs of the  research consortia and DAIT, and facilitate communication and collaboration; (2) provide experienced  scientists and statisticians who, in collaboration with clinical investigators and senior DAIT officials, will design  and analyze studies across the full scope of research in transplantation; (3) facilitate the development, review,  and revision of initial and successive drafts of protocols and protocol-related documents through dedicated TG  protocol teams; and (4) provide study initiation and study management functions that are required for the  efficient and ethical conduct of studies. Because RhoFED is currently the Statistical and Clinical Coordinating  Center (SACCC) for the CTOT, CTOT-C and GTCRP consortia and is the Statistical Data Coordinating Center  (SDCC) for ITN, Rho is uniquely well-qualified to provide consolidated Center support across these consortia.  By providing staff with experience in supporting transplantation research, an administrative infrastructure  designed to enhance collaboration between DAIT Project Officers and the consortia investigators, and a plan  for agile and effective resource management, we believe that support of these consortia through the newly  formed Center and its TG will directly contribute to the achievement of the DAIT objective to improve clinical  outcomes following solid organ transplantation."
"9257476","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Increasing availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has led to decreases in mortality rates. The WHO estimates that 1.7 million deaths were attributable to HIV in 2011 with the majority caused by co-infecting pathogens. Despite a strong initial response to the HIV epidemic, Uganda still has a prevalence rate of 7.2% among adults aged 15-49 according to UNAIDS. Many patients still present late in infection and often co-infected with opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and cryptococcal meningitis. Viral hepatitis (B & C) co-infection occurs in 2-10% of HIV-infected individuals and present challenges in terms of best anti-viral treatment, diagnosis, and prevention. As HIV-infected patients live longer on ART, viral hepatitis related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma which are accelerated by HIV infection will dominate as causes of death in the virally suppressed. The Infectious Diseases Institute (IDI) in Uganda is a Research Center of Excellence and has already established research programs in HIV co-infections under the previous Head of Research (Y. Manabe, Program Director). The current Head of Research (A. Kambugu, Ugandan Program Director) has worked closely with Dr. Manabe for the last 5 years when he was Head of Clinical Services. Basic descriptive epidemiology has already been published in these focal areas at the IDI by rigorously trained PhD students who have been successfully awarded doctoral degrees and who are capable of original scientific investigation. The overarching objective of the program is to train Ugandans to perform locally relevant research in the area of HIV co-infections including tuberculosis, cryptococcal meningitis, and viral hepatitis. This IDI research context and mentorship model will support post-doctoral researchers at the IDI to become fully independent; capable of writing grants and expanding research interests to prevention, improved models of care, new diagnostics evaluations, advanced biostatistical methodology to analyze longitudinal cohorts, and translational basic science research in Uganda through overseas rotations. Four Masters students will be trained at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in topical areas for which courses are not available at Makerere College of Health Sciences such as health economics, health systems, and translational, basic research in the co-infections listed above. Three Ugandan Masters' students per year will also be supported to fill the pipeline with new researchers. At the end of this 5-year training program, our overarching objective is to solidify a core group of productive, independent scientists who can garner outside funding, continue to mentor others, and be recognized as international, regional leaders in the area of HIV co-infections."
"9270529","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Multiple myeloma (MM), an incurable malignancy of clonal plasma cells, is preceded by the largely asymptomatic monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). An estimated 3% of all US adults aged ?50 years have this precursor condition, yet few biological or clinical markers predicting progression to MM have been identified. As a result, MGUS patients endure the need for periodic clinical follow-up and related medical costs, as well as heightened anxiety. Currently, population-based studies of MGUS rely on stored blood specimens or extensive registries for definitive diagnoses, an inefficient process that makes large-scale studies of MGUS difficult to initiate. The objective of this proposal is to develop new methods to efficiently conduct population-based research on MGUS using automated healthcare claims and electronic health record data. The specific aims of this project are to develop novel algorithms with maximum positive predictive value (PPV) to efficiently and accurately identify patients diagnosed with MGUS in community-based healthcare settings through the use of longitudinally-collected automated healthcare claims and electronic health record data available from 1999-2013. The proposed algorithms will be developed and piloted at the Meyers Primary Care Institute among patients aged ?50 years seeking care at Reliant Medical Group, a community-based practice providing care to a large population in central Massachusetts, and a member of the NCI-funded, nationwide Cancer Research Network. The first algorithm will be derived from data available in healthcare claims alone, including diagnosis and procedure codes. Subsequent algorithms will incorporate results from relevant laboratory tests available in electronic health records, including serum and urine protein electrophoresis and immunofixation, serum free light chain testing, and bone marrow biopsy. All potential data will then be refined in a classification and regression tree analysis. A gold standard will be developed through comprehensive review of electronic health records by two independent physician reviewers for calculation of PPV. The demographic, clinical, and health service utilization characteristics of the population of MGUS patients identified by the algorithms will be described, and compared to an age- and gender-matched patient population without MGUS. The next step beyond the present proposal will validate the algorithm that provides the highest PPV at other healthcare systems participating in the Cancer Research Network and develop a nationally-representative cohort of MGUS patients for etiological and health services research on this prevalent but highly understudied premalignant condition."
"9327808","PROJECT SUMMARY One of the best characterized pathways implicated in metabolic dysfunction is the activation of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, which guides cellular processes pertaining to adipogenesis and nutrient utilization. Developmental exposures to PPAR-activating toxicants have been widely associated with low birth weight, and yet, these individuals have increased risk for obesity and diabetes later in life. Pharmacological activation of PPAR signaling is the mode of action for some of the most effective drugs for Type II Diabetes. However, chronic exposures to environmental PPAR activators are associated with increased risk for metabolic syndrome in adulthood. The spatiotemporal mechanisms guiding this shift in metabolic efficiency require extensive characterization. Preliminary data demonstrates that embryonic exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), a PPAR? activator, alters pancreas morphology and embryonic expression of hormones and digestive enzymes crucial for metabolism. The goal of this study is to identify the mechanisms by which toxicant-induced PPAR activation perturbs embryonic nutrition, yet increases susceptibility to metabolic syndrome later in life. The first aim of this study will determine the mechanisms by which PFOS-induced PPAR signaling perturbs embryonic nutrient uptake, distribution and metabolism in the zebrafish embryo?a homologous model for human embryonic nutrition. The second aim of this study will discover windows of susceptibility during which chronic exogenous PPAR activation can influence pancreatic ?-cell resilience and function, and can increase risk for obesity and diabetes. Overall, this project serves to elucidate a relationship between exogenous PPAR activation, embryonic nutrition, and metabolic syndrome later in life. This project directly addresses the goals of NIEHS to: 1) provide a mechanism by which developmental exposures to PPAR- activating compounds directly affects embryonic uptake, distribution, and metabolism, and 2) identify the longitudinal pathologic and biochemical consequences of these same exposures to identify key windows of susceptibility to metabolic dysfunction throughout the lifecourse."
"9274915","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Chronic HCV infection and associated liver disease are associated with impaired response to HBV/HAV vaccine and greater morbid outcomes upon pathogen exposure, yet strategies to improve these prophylactic vaccine responses are not available. Though effectiveness of HCV therapy will continue to improve, the substantial majority of HCV infected individuals remain untreated, and improving vaccine response will remain an important goal over the coming decade. Effects of HCV on the immune system that may contribute to impaired vaccine response include decreased naive CD4 cell and dendritic cell (DC) subset numbers, skewing of T-, B- and NK-cell subsets, and T cell exhaustion. Additionally, chronic HCV infection and associated liver disease are associated with immune activation (sCD14, LPS, IL-6, HLA-DR+CD38+CD4/8 cells). Emerging evidence, including our data, indicates HCV associated immune activation (CD16+56-NK subset frequency and sCD14) correlates with disease stage and negatively predicts host response to IFN therapy. To identify molecular drivers of immune activation we performed a non-biased comprehensive plasma proteome analysis to determine the correlates of immune activation. Our lead molecule was plasma ENPP2 (autotaxin). ENPP2 was elevated during HCV infection with advanced liver disease, and best correlated with CD4 activation during HCV infection. The product of ENPP2 activity, lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), activates T cells, providing a potential pathway amenable to therapeutic interruption. We propose HCV induced immune activation impairs host response to neoantigen (e.g. vaccine and new infectious challenge). Supporting this, during HIV infection where immune activation also exists, our preliminary data indicate higher CD4+HLADR+CD38+ T cell frequency negatively predicts host response to Hepatitis A vaccine, while greater naive CD4+ numbers positively predict response. Recent evidence also indicates markers of immune activation negatively predict HBV vaccine response during HCV infection. Older age is also associated with susceptibility to infection and impaired response to vaccine. The combined effects of aging and chronic HCV infection on the immune system are not yet characterized, but highly significant as this patient population continues to grow. Importantly, we observed that both aging and chronic HCV infection result in higher ENPP2 levels. Therefore ENPP2 may be a common therapeutic target, and an ideal metric in our proposed analyses. With the growing age of the US and VA HCV infected population, and with morbidity (cirrhosis, HCC, impaired therapy response) projected to peak in 2030 primarily in the aged HCV population, we propose that quantifying the combined effects of age and chronic HCV infection on the immune system, and the impact of ENPP2 on the neoantigen response will guide therapeutic strategies. In Aim 1 we will Determine the independent contributions of untreated HCV, immune activation, age, ENPP2 and LPA to neoantigen (hepatitis A/B vaccine) vs. recall antigen (tetanus booster vaccine) response. In Aim 2 we will Determine the effect of ENPP2 inhibition on murine host response to neoantigen in the setting of chronic LCMV infection."
"9271219","This core will provide a hybrid (targeted, non-targeted) metabolomics platform to support  chemical profiling of RBC and other biological samples as needed by the POI studies.  The central platform consists of dual chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry  coupled with a series of data extraction algorithms that provide relative quantification of  up to 90,000 high-mass accuracy (5 ppm) m/z features, representing in excess of 10,000  chemicals present in human samples. Targeted analysis allows direct measurement of  over 300 chemicals with known identity and capabilities to detect unidentified and  unknown chemicals contributing to outcomes. Experience with analyses of thousands of  samples shows that the method measures ions that match more than half of the  metabolites in human metabolic charts; selected confirmation of identities by co-elution  and MS/MS shows that the approach provides an effective global survey of metabolism,  capturing metabolites in 146 out of 154 pathways in KEGG human metabolic pathways.  Potentially useful for the current proposal, the approach also detects thousands of  chemicals derived from diet, the host microbiome, infectious agents and environmental  exposures, which could contribute to variation in recipient susceptibility to transfusions of  stored RBCs. Rigorous adherence to standard operating procedures using dedicated  instruments with internal standards and external pooled reference samples will provide  the capability to support metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) to identify both  endogenous and foreign chemicals in RBCs that are associated with specific clinical  and/or functional outcomes in the proposed studies. Samples are analyzed in triplicate  so that coefficients of variation are determined for each m/z feature in each sample.  Selection of data extraction parameters allows more liberal data extraction criteria for  discovery-based analysis and more rigorous targeted criteria using stable isotope  dilution and multiple ion monitoring to test specific hypotheses. For unknown and  unidentified chemicals, mass spectral data consisting of accurate mass m/z, retention  time and relative quantification as ion intensity are used with data-based searching for  putative chemical identification. Data dependent ion-dissociation (MS/MS and MS)  analyses are provided on representative or selected samples to confirm identities of  targeted metabolites and/or high abundance m/z features."
"9268542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the graying of America we are faced with the need to address the ever increasing number of individuals in our society who have age-associated nervous system diseases and conditions. It is estimated that by the year 2050, there will be up to 16 million Americans with Alzheimer's disease and an even larger number with additional nervous system-related diseases that are attributed to the aging of our population. To address this problem, we need multidisciplinary approaches to facilitate the discovery of the mechanisms, treatments and prevention of these diseases. Active, integrated research-based training of pre-doctoral students is a key to re- supplying the research personnel needed to address these biomedical health care issues. Herein we propose to continue a successful predoctoral program that focuses on the neurobiology of aging. The present application is a competing renewal of a very successful program of pre- and post-doctoral training at the University of North Texas Health Science Center (UNTHSC). This funding cycle we had 22 full fellows, of whom 10 completed their training and their Ph.D. and an additional 17 associate fellows for a total of 39 trainees in less than 5 years. Our trainees published 91 peer-reviewed papers; we trained 7 (of 22 = 32%) minority students as full fellows; 6 (of 17 = 35%), for a total of 33% minority participation in our training program. The proposed training program will enhance an already strong and successful training program in the neurobiology of aging. The continuation of our predoctoral training program is proposed, as our Institute for Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Research (IAADR), founded by the Training Program Director, has matured through the addition of faculty and the funding of three program project grants, and has initiated clinical research into the causes, treatment and prevention of brain aging and Alzheimer's Disease at the UNTHSC. Collectively, our new training initiatives create a stimulating environment for the training of predoctoral trainees in the neurobiology of aging. Unique features of the training program are (1) our Associate Fellows program, which increases the number of trainees participating fully in the training program; (2) our emphasis on diversity training, that resulted in a 33% minority participation in the training program; (3) our high institutional support which is proposed to amount in an institutional commitment to the training program of approximately $276,800 over the next 5 years; (4) our focus on the development of research excellence and leadership among our trainees; and (5) our Preceptor-in-Training Program, which trains our more junior preceptors in pre-doctoral training. Collectively, these attributes of our Neurobiology of Aging Training Program have produced an outstanding program of training that we wish to continue."
"9275386","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Problem: Diabetes (DM) increases cardiovascular (CV) and all-cause mortality despite aggressive risk factor modification. Our long term goal is to define novel targets for cardiovascular risk reduction in diabetes. Vascular mitochondria are a potential new target. Mitochondria regulate endothelial function and smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation and mitochondrial dysfunction is a hallmark of diabetes. Exercise elicits an adaptive improvement in mitochondrial quality in healthy vessels; this response is absent in diabetes. The question addressed in this proposal is whether pharmacological targeting of eNOS and SIRT with glucagon- like peptide 1 (GLP-1) can restore signaling to mitochondrial biogenesis and improve mitochondrial dynamics and vascular function. GLP-1 is a diabetes medication that also induces eNOS, SIRT1, mitochondrial biogenesis and autophagy 21. New preliminary data suggest that saxagliptin (SAXA), a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor that increases circulating endogenous GLP-1, restores induction of eNOS and mitochondrial protein expression with exercise in DM and improves running distance.  Hypotheses: Abnormal mitochondrial function and impaired stress mediated mitochondrial dynamics in the diabetic vasculature will be improved by GLP-1 via eNOS and SIRT1 signaling.  SA #1: What is the impact of GLP-1 on vascular mitochondrial adaptation in DM? Rationale: Control rats subjected to 8 day exercise show increased activation of the mitochondrial biogenesis, improved mitochondrial function plus increased fusion and decreased fission. We will examine the impact of GLP-1 on vascular mitochondrial function and turnover in diabetes and use targeted deletion of eNOS, endothelial cell (EC) SIRT1, SMC SIRT1 with or without exercise to test mitochondrial homeostatic adaptation in vivo. Hypothesis 1.1: Intervention with GLP-1 will improve mitochondrial function through augmentation of vascular mitochondrial adaptation (biogenesis, fusion and autophagy) to exercise in high fat induced diabetes. Hypothesis 1.2: eNOS and/or SIRT1 are required for GLP-1 rescue of mitochondrial adaptation. Approach: 1a. Male C57BL6 on chow versus high fat (HF) diet for 10 weeks will be randomized to GLP-1 or vehicle with or without exercise for 8 days. 1b. c57eNOS -/- and c57b eNOS +/+ will be treated as in SA1a. 1c. c57 mice with EC or SMC deletion of SIRT1 and controls will be treated as in SA1a. These experiments will clarify the importance of eNOS and SIRT1 for vascular mitochondrial adaptation to exercise in vivo and define the impact of diabetes and GLP-1 on these pathways.  SA #2: How does diabetes affect dynamic mitochondrial adaptation in vascular cells in vitro? Rationale: Regulation of mitochondrial function requires a complex interplay between mitochondrial biogene- sis and remodeling through fission, fusion and autophagy. Hypothesis 2.1: Endothelial cells and/or smooth muscle cells from DM models will have impaired mitochondrial dynamics. Hypothesis 2.2: GLP-1 will improve mitochondrial function and dynamics in DM cells through eNOS and/or SIRT. Approach: These experiments will examine the impact of DM and GLP-1 on mitochondrial quality and dynamics in vitro and employ genetic approaches to define the relative contribution of eNOS and SIRT for mitochondrial quality in vascular cells.  Impact on the Veteran Population: Mitochondrial dynamics are a novel target to decrease excess CV risk in diabetes. Interventions targeting mitochondrial ROS have been consistently ineffective in human studies. Our observation that 8 days of treatment with SAXA restores vascular induction of mitochondrial biogenesis provides proof of concept that impaired vascular mitochondrial adaptation is targetable with a currently available drug. Pharmacological restoration of mitochondrial dynamics in diabetes could have implications for macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes."
"9275372","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         In utero alcohol exposure may lead to Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders (FASD), which cause learning deficits. Alcohol abuse is a well-known problem in the veteran population, which includes a growing number of women of childbearing age. Some of the effects of ethanol in the developing brain have been attributed to a premature loss of neuronal plasticity. Astrocytes play a major role in mediating neuronal plasticity and in the formation of neuronal connectivity during development. We have recently shown that cholinergic stimulation of astrocytes in vitro increases the levels of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins laminin and fibronectin, which trigger neuritogenesis in hippocampal neurons while ethanol decreases the levels of neuritogenic ECM in astrocytes and astrocyte-induced neuritogenesis. Neuritogenic ECM proteins can be modulated by changes in their rate of degradation. In preliminary studies we found that tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), involved in the degradation of the ECM, are upregulated by ethanol. Our studies also suggest that the epigenetic mechanism of DNA methylation may be involved in this effect of ethanol, as ethanol inhibits DNA methyltrasferases (DNMTs) and tPA promoter DNA methylation in astrocytes, events associated with increased gene expression. We hypothesize that ethanol-induced inhibition of DNMT activity in astrocytes increases the expression of proteins involved in ECM degradation and inhibits hippocampal plasticity. Consistent with our findings, DNA methylation is delayed by ethanol during development. Ethanol- induced DNMT activity and DNA methylation changes in astrocytes and their consequences on neurons are unexplored. The most promising treatment for FASD is choline, which can be converted to phosphatidylcholine (PC), a major membrane phospholipid, and, in the liver and kidney only, to methionine and then to s- adenosylmethionine (SAM), the main methyl donor in the enzymatic reaction of DNA methylation catalyzed by DNMT enzymes. The neurochemical mechanisms by which choline supplementation ameliorates hippocampal functions affected by prenatal alcohol exposure remains elusive. Preliminary studies show that, in vitro, astrocyte treatment with both choline and SAM prevents ethanol-induced DNMT inhibition. The overarching hypothesis of this study is that ethanol inhibits DNMT activity, decreases tPA and uPA promoter DNA methylation, increases expression and release of uPA and tPA, decreases neuritogenic ECM, and inhibits neuritogenesis/dendritic arborization in the developing hippocampus. Choline and SAM, by restoring DNMT activity, prevent the effects of ethanol on DNMT activity, uPA and tPA expression, ECM levels, and neuritogenesis/dendritic arborization. Aim 1 will characterize of the effects of ethanol treatments , with or without choline and SAM, and of DNMT inhibition in astrocytes on DNMT activity and expression, uPA and tPA expression, release, activity, promoter DNA methylation, and PC levels in astrocytes and on neuritogenesis. Aim 2 will investigate the effect of in vivo ethanol exposure from postnatal day (PD) 4 to PD 9 and choline treatments on hippocampal DNMT activity and expression, tPA and uPA expression and promoter DNA methylation, fibronectin and laminin protein levels, and dendritic arborization and spine density. These endpoints will be measured on PD 9 and on PD 30. The expression of fibronectin, laminin-1, tPA, uPA, and DNMT isoforms in astrocytes and neurons will be verified by immunohistochemistry. This study may unveil novel glia-mediated effects of ethanol on neuronal development and provide mechanisms by which choline protects hippocampal neuron development from the effects of ethanol by modulating astrocytic functions. 1"
"9275320","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Infection with Staphylococcus aureus (SA) remains an important clinical challenge despite potent antibiotics. Novel therapeutic advances await elucidation of the molecular bases for persistence, chronicity, and metastatic spread - i.e. the hallmarks of SA infection. The remarkable proclivity of SA to produce severe and chronic human disease reflects, in part, the array of virulence factors it expresses, including a phosphoinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) that is secreted during its late logarithmic growth phase. PI-PLC is secreted during infection and is immunogenic, making it a candidate as a virulence factor.  Human polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) are at the front-line of cellular innate immune-mediated host defense against SA infection, and PMN exert ~ all of their antimicrobial effort against SA internalized within phagosomes. During PMN phagocytosis and coincident with activation of the phagocyte NADPH oxidase, granules fuse with nascent phagosomes and release their contents into the phagosome, thereby exposing the ingested microbe to an array of toxic agents and a flux of oxidants that collaborate to kill microbes in phagosomes. However, despite the presence of this potent PMN antimicrobial system, 10-20% of ingested SA remain viable, but not replicating, in PMN. In response to PMN toxins in phagosomes, persisting viable SA stimulate PMN to initiate transcriptional programs that dictate the fate of PMN.  SA-laden PMN have two potential fates: they may progress from atypical apoptosis to necrosis, with release of viable SA, or can be ingested by macrophages (Mf), thereby triggering phenotypic responses that promote further inflammation. Whereas Mf uptake of typical apoptotic PMN occurs without triggering proinflammatory cascades (i.e. a non phlogistic response), we have recently demonstrated that Mf ingestion of SA-PMN promoted aberrant cytokine responses. Persistence of SA within phagocytes has profound clinical consequences, as signature features of SA infection are relapse, metastases, and failure of antibiotics to which SA are susceptible. In murine infection models, PMN-associated SA recovered from an abscess can transmit infection to na?ve mice, demonstrating that PMN can serve as a Trojan horse, covertly entering macrophages (Mf) and then disseminating to cause metastatic infection.  Given our preliminary data, we propose studies to test the overall hypothesis that SA PI-PLC serves as a virulence factor for SA by virtue of its ability to undermine phagocyte innate host defense. We hypothesize that PI-PLC may contribute to SA infection at two distinct stages: (1) early in infection, before effective cellular host defenses have been engaged and organisms ingested, extracellular PI-PLC will attack vulnerable substrates, including those on recruited phagocytes, and undermine their capacity to respond normally (Aim 1); and (2) later, after ingestion by phagocytes PI-PLC-expressing SA within phagosomes will alter PMN-Mf interactions, interfere with normal resolution of inflammation, and promote infection and dissemination (Aim 2). Our Specific Aims include: Aim 1. To determine the impact of extracellular SA PI-PLC on phagocyte function and innate host  defense - focusing on priming of PMN NADPH oxidase and direct agonist effects phagocytes, and Aim 2. To determine the contribution of PI-PLC expressed within PMN on initiation and promotion of  SA infection - focusing on PMN and Mf fate in vitro and consequences in infection in vivo.  We have generated the analytical tools and developed experimental models necessary to study the effects of PI-PLC on phagocyte responses, and our ongoing studies of interactions between PMN containing viable SA and Mf provide a framework to model in vitro the fate of SA-laden PMN as might occur in infection."
"9482489","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this study is to investigate the cell biological mechanisms that drive the formation of the gastrointestinal epithelium. Although much progress has been made in understanding in the molecular genetics of gastrointestinal tract development and disease, the dynamic cell behaviors that contribute to organ shape and function are less well understood. During embryonic development, endodermal cells initially undergo a phase of highly dynamic single-cell migration but then later converge and adhere together into a coherent endodermal sheet, which ultimately gives rise to the epithelial lining of the gut tube. For this study, I will use high-resolution fluorescence imaging of live zebrafish embryos to investigate the transition from single- cell migration to epithelium formation. Preliminary experiments suggest that endodermal cells initiate epithelium formation by upregulating cell junction molecules to facilitate adhesion between cells while also spatially regulating actin polymerization and membrane protrusion to close gaps in the newly forming sheet. In the first aim of this study, I will determine the mechanisms by which cells identify cell free areas and extend their membrane across these gaps. Concurrently, I will define the progression of cell-cell adhesion by monitoring the dynamics of fluorescently labeled cell junction components alpha-catenin, E-cadherin, and ZO- 1. Finally, I will use RNA-Seq transcriptome profiling to identify new factors in endodermal sheet formation and will test the function of these new candidate genes by generating mutants with CRISPR/Cas9 technology. In Aim2, I will explore the role of the cytoskeletal gene septin9a (sept9a) in endodermal sheet formation. I had previously identified sept9a as gene that is upregulated specifically in the endoderm at the onset of sheet formation. Septins are known to regulate changes in cell shape and cortex tension, which may provide the necessary structural integrity to form a coherent epithelium. In this aim, I will characterize the effects of sept9a loss-of-function mutations on endodermal cell motility, cell-cell interactions, and the initiation and maintenance of cell-cell adhesion. Proper formation of the gastrointestinal epithelium is required for the tissue to perform its functions in barrier protection, digestion, and nutrient absorption, and defects in epithelial structure may lead to diseases such as inflammatory bowel disease. However, much of our current understanding of epithelium formation has come from in vitro cell culture systems that may not accurately represent epithelial differentiation as occurs in a developing embryo. Thus, the early zebrafish endoderm may be a much-needed in vivo model of de novo epithelium formation. This model could be used in future studies exploring fundamental aspects of epithelial biology as well as the cell biological mechanisms underlying gastrointestinal disorders and diseases."

Death rates in our patient population in the southeast are even higher with African Americans having higher rates yet. Our VA patients reflect our local population with elevated risk of heart disease often presenting with hypertension, diabetes, obesity or overweight, smoking and excessive alcohol use. VA patients who have incurred LV injury due to myocardial infarction (MI) undergo ventricular remodeling, which can lead to chamber dilation and progress to congestive heart fail-ure. Monocyte-derived macrophages are believed to play a major role in the regulation of infarct healing. Post-MI repair is made up of a biphasic process with phase I mediated by inflammatory M1 macrophages that are phagocytic, and secrete high levels of MMPs, and proinflammatory mediators. By contrast the M2 macrophages produce anti-inflammatory cytokines and communicate with myofibroblasts, endothelial cells, parenchymal and local progenitor cells to help coordinate remodeling and repair of the damaged tissue. The controlled recruitment of the inflammatory monocytes and resulting macrophages is essential for proper healing but excessive or prolonged recruitment of these inflammatory monocytes and M1 macrophage results in deleterious remodeling and heart failure. Recent studies have demonstrated that increasing the M1 to M2 polarization appears to be an attractive strategy for decreasing inflammation and improvement of infarct healing and repair. Our preliminary data provide evidence for the first time that class I HDACs regulate M1 to M2 polarization of macrophages of the post-MI heart. Therefore, we hypothesize that class I HDACs serve as a master regulator of macrophage polarization and HDAC inhibitors reprogram the infiltrating monocytes and resulting macrophages toward the M2 phenotype in the post-MI heart. We have proposed Three Aims to test our hypothesis. Aim 1) Demonstrate that inhibition of class I HDACs attenuates M1 macrophage recruitment and promotes M1 to M2 polarization, which fosters infarct healing. Aim 2) Determine if targeted delivery of a class I HDAC inhibitor to inflammatory monocytes attenuates MI injury. Aim 3) Determine if treatment with a class I selective HDAC inhibitor in a murine model of chronic inflammation commonly seen in patients with atherosclerosis, results in reduced deleterious remodeling and preservation of ventricular function. Our approach will allow us to directly test whether targeted delivery of class I HDAC inhibitors to monocytes and macrophages can override the overwhelming inflammatory extracellular signaling milieu in the acute MI ventricle to reprogram macrophage phenotype to influence M1 to M2 transition. Importantly, our study will give us important new molecular insights into the role of class I HDACs in regulating macrophage polarization and possibly open a new translational approach for treatment of post-MI VA patients. It is hoped that the findings of this application will be translated into new and successful clinical treatment strategies to ameliorate post-MI injury for our Veterans."
"9305037","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Type 2 diabetes is a major public health concern. Diabetes currently affects 25.8 million people in the US alone, 90-95% of all cases are type 2 and it disproportionately affects ethnic minorities in the US, including Mexican Americans. There are many microvascular and macrovascular complications related to diabetes, including a significantly increased risk of heart disease and stroke, blindness, kidney failure and kidney disease, neuropathy, and retinopathy. Several risk factors predispose individuals to the development of this disease including demographic characteristics like sex, age and ethnicity; and behavioral and lifestyle-related modifications. In addition, metabolic determinants such as impaired glucose tolerance and insulin resistance increase the risk of an individual progressing to type 2 diabetes. There have been continued efforts to localize and characterize T2D susceptibility genes using genome-wide linkage and genome-wide association study approaches, aside from the traditional candidate gene approach. Although linkage studies have identified various T2D susceptibility loci, subsequent gene discovery successes from such efforts have been limited. In recent years, the GWAS method has become a popular design with unprecedented successes in localization of several novel T2D susceptibility loci, however, these common variants explain only about 10% of the total heritability indicating more loci remain to be identified. This has led to an increased interest in the potential role of rare variants in common complex diseases. As one of the five research groups involved in the T2D-GENES consortium, the data obtained from our San Antonio Mexican American Family Studies (SAMAFS) have contributed to the two major projects of T2D- GENES. This proposal, submitted in response to the RFA-DK-14-003 (AMP T2D-GENES consortium) aims to build on and expand the research activities of the T2D-GENES consortium. We will (i) expand the WGS data with an additional (already available) 1,000 whole genomes from SAMAFS to reaffirm the already found rare and private variant associations with T2D and glucose traits in Mexican Americans; and replicate selected rare association findings in other cohorts; (ii) recall approximately 300 (100 T2D and 200 non-T2D) SAMAFS participants from families carrying rare or private variants to perform deep phenotyping in which we will collect metabolic information, 3 tissues (muscle, fat, and PBMCs) for gene expression analysis and metabolomic profiling; and (iii) directly identify putative regulatory variants in gene regions of interest influencing T2D and perform preliminary functional assessment of associated variants, both rare and common. The estimated economic burden of diabetes in the United States alone is approximately $245 billion per year, making this disease of major public health importance. The ability to identify genes that are causally involved in disease risk provides an unparalleled opportunity to quickly determine biological pathways that are involved in disease pathology. A better understanding of the genetic contribution to diabetes development will provide novel approaches for the characterization, treatment and potential prevention of this costly disease."

She has a particular interest in testing a dyadic sleep intervention program for Alzheimer?s disease patients and their informal caregivers. Dr. Song?s unique background makes her an ideal candidate for this field of research. She has fellowship training in advanced geriatrics, and has board certification in advanced practice nursing as a family nurse practitioner. She is currently supported by an Advanced Fellowship in Geriatrics through the Veterans Affairs (VA) Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System, Geriatric Research, Education, and Clinical Center (GRECC). Career development and training plan: This plan features an outstanding research and educational environment at UCLA, with nationally renowned expert mentors. Her primary mentoring team is comprised of Drs. Jennifer Martin (expert in behavioral sleep interventions), Cathy Alessi (expert in sleep medicine), Michael Irwin (expert in inflammatory factors and sleep), and Edmond Teng (expert in assessment of AD). She will also draw on resources available through UCLA?s CTSI, UCLA?s Multicampus Program in Geriatric Medicine and Gerontology, UCLA?s Claude D. Pepper Center, and the GRECC. Her training plan features carefully curated coursework and hands-on training experiences, all aligned with her training goals. Research plan: The proposed research is hypothesis-driven and guided by preliminary data from Dr. Song?s VA-funded pilot study and existing behavioral sleep intervention methods. During the past 2 years of her fellowship, she has developed a dyadic sleep intervention program. In phase 1 (Aim 1), she will iteratively refine and finalize the intervention program targeting both members of the dyad (patients and caregivers) by evaluating acceptability and usability. In phase 2 (Aims 2-4) she will pilot test the program effects by assessing sleep, health, and quality of life in both members of the group using a small randomized controlled trial design, with the main analyses focused on caregiver outcomes. The intervention program will involve five sessions, including 4 home visits and one telephone session. It will include manualized sleep hygiene recommendations and a behavioral sleep intervention including sleep compression therapy. A unique aspect of the proposed work is that the program is tailored to address sleep problems of both patients and caregivers, and includes upstream biomarkers to evaluate a key mechanism of intervention benefits that can be further explored in future research. Skills developed from executing this training and research plan will enable Dr. Song to become an independent researcher and a leader in research on managing sleep in AD patients and their caregivers, with the goal of improving their health and quality of life."
"9391809","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Women in the criminal justice system are four-five times as likely to have cervical cancer compared to non- incarcerated women. In our previous research, we found that the most important contributor to cervical cancer risk, and perhaps lack of follow-up, is incarcerated women's low health literacy about broader reproductive health issues. Until we effectively address incarcerated women's unique reproductive health literacy needs, the cervical cancer health disparity between incarcerated and non-incarcerated women will persist. The objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of a sexual health empowerment (SHE Project) intervention to improve cervical health knowledge, reduce barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, improve self-efficacy for navigatin providers and health care systems, and ultimately work towards preventing cervical cancer. This objective is responsive to PAR-10-133 in that it develops an intervention strategy to address health literacy and broader health outcomes in a vulnerable population. To meet the objectives of this study, we propose to assess the impact of a sexual health empowerment intervention (SHE Project) on cervical health knowledge; barriers to screening that are related to beliefs about cervical cancer, and self-efficacy for screening and follow-up among women leaving jail. More specifically, we will conduct a pre- and post-intervention assessment from baseline to the end of a weeklong intervention using a wait-list control design. Next, we will use a three-year observational study design employing both survey and ethnographic methods for follow-up, to understand how knowledge, beliefs, self-efficacy, and other factors change post-release cervical health prevention behaviors over time. This approach will allow us to observe the extent to which women translate, if at all, increased knowledge, reduced barriers, and increased self-efficacy into practice during clinical encounters, or if other factors explain health behaviors ove time. The public health impact of this study is its potential to reduce cervical cancer morbidity and mortality for this high risk and vulnerable group of women. Our development of an effective and easily disseminated health literacy intervention that can be adapted to many health conditions and broader cancer prevention efforts in institutionalized populations (jails, prisons, community corrections, military institutions) will have an impact on public health, and also on the science of developing effective health literacy interventions."
"9210527","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Failure of the right ventricle (RV) is a prevalent cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,  and the leading cause of death in patients with pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, RV failure frequently arises in patients with failure of the left ventricle (LV) and causes markedly worse symptoms and prognosis contrasted with patients with LV failure without RV dysfunction. Despite clinical significance, RV failure is relatively understudied, poorly understood and there i a need for more effective therapies to treat RV failure. We reported that the inotropic response to stimulation of ?1-adrenergic receptors (?1-ARs) is fundamentally different in the RV (negative  inotropy) vs. LV (positive inotropy). Importantly, in RV failure, ?1-AR inotropic responses are upregulated and switched from a negative inotropic response in non-failing RV to a robust positive inotropic response in failing RV. This renewal project will build on the following recent observations: * Of the two major cardiac ?1-AR subtypes (?1A & ?1B), the dramatic switch from ?1-AR-mediated negative  inotropy in non-failing RV to positive inotropy in failing RV is mediated solely by the ?1A-subtype but not  the ?1B-subtype, suggesting that ?1A-subtype signaling is upregulated in failing RV.  Consistent with beneficial effects mediated by the ?1A-subtype, in a model of RV failure, treatment for 2  wk. with the ?1A-subtype-specific agonist A61603 has major beneficial effects evidenced by improved in-  vivo function, and reduced myocardial injury (evidenced by lower serum cardiac TnI, less myocardial  fibrosis, and less ultrastructural cellular damage observed in electron micrographs). * Mechanistically, levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are elevated in failing RV, and our preliminary  studies show that for failing RV, chronic treatment with A61603 increased levels of superoxide dismutase  (SOD) and markedly reduced ROS. * ROS increases expression and activity of two intracellular isoforms of matrix-metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2):  the canonical full-length MMP-2 (FL-MMP-2) and a novel N-terminal truncated isoform (NTT-MMP-2). We  reported that FL-MMP-2 impairs myocardial force by causing damage to the myofilaments. In contrast, we  found that NTT-MMP-2 impairs myocardial force by impairing Ca2+ handling, without damage to myofilaments. * Chronic treatment with A61603 markedly reduces levels of FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2. Thus, for failing  RV, ?1A-subtype-mediated lowering of FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2 levels may reduce damage to  myofilaments and Ca2+ handling. Consistent with this, we found that for failing RV chronic treatment with  A61603 increased myofilament function.  1. Hypothesis: For failing RV, chronic ?1A-subtype stimulation causes reduced ROS, which leads to  decreased levels of FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2, and thereby, to reduced damage to myofilaments and  Ca2+ handling.  2. Hypothesis: Chronic therapy with a ?1A-subtype agonist is beneficial in a chronic model of RV failure. Aim 1. Determine the mechanisms for the beneficial effects of ?1A-subtype therapy in RV failure. For failing RV, we will determine if the beneficial effects of ?1A therapy with A61603 involves increased SOD, leading to reduced ROS, which results in lower levels of FL-MMP-2 and NTT-MMP-2, and thereby, reduced damage to myofilaments and Ca2+ handling. Aim 2. Determine if chronic ?1A therapy has a beneficial effect on recovery of RV function in a chronic model of already established RV failure. Using a chronic pulmonary stenosis model of established RV failure, we will chronically treat mice for up to 20 wk. with A61603. We will determine if A61603 induces recovery of RV function and outcomes in chronic RV failure, and determine the mechanisms involved."
"9269649","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The focus of this application is on Strengthening Ugandan Biomedical Engineering HIV/TB Human Resource Research Capacity. Most of the technology (equipment) used for care or research in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is donated, inappropriate and non functional. HIV/AIDS and related illnesses remain major challenges to health in SSA, where 69% of the global HIV disease burden resides. In Uganda, 1.4 million people were estimated to be living with HIV and only 38% are receiving ART according to the 2013 WHO guidelines for ART initiation. Tuberculosis is a re-emerging disease that imposes a particularly massive health burden on sub-Saharan Africa. In Uganda TB may affect up to 50% of co-infected persons and is the leading cause of death among HIV seropositive persons with a high potential for the emergence of Multi Drug Resistant (MDR) strains. The absence of appropriately trained research human resource for research capacity in biomedical engineering limits the application of technology in HIV/TB research and care in these settings. This is becoming more marked given the corresponding growth in human resource research capacity to support non technology aspects of HIV/TB clinical care and research. There is a need to develop capacity to promote effective biomedical engineering/technology research and utilization. This planning grant is part of a larger effort to promote the use of appropriate basic science supported interventions/technologies in the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of HIV and TB in our low resource settings. The. This will be done through the development of a local biomedical engineering graduate level training program in collaboration with Duke University. The team, composed of specialists/global experts from different disciplines, is not only familiar with the local context of the study population, but has expertise covering the full range of skills from the bench to the bedside. The principal investigator runs a certified fully equipped, technologically dependant, molecular biology laboratory that has among others Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and a DNA sequencing platforms. The team will also use access to various care and research settings/organisations in Uganda to maximize the local learning opportunities of the students in the proposed future training program. This goal of the application will be achieved through the following specific aims: Aim 1: Will evaluate the current status of biomedical technology utilization for HIV/TB related research and care in Uganda through a survey on the status of existing pieces of equipment for HIV research and care at selected sites. Aim 2: Will mobilize resources to support graduate level training and research to promote effective utilization of equipment in HIV/TB research and care, through a series of meeting with various stakeholders in the country. Aim 3: will lead to the preparation the D43 training grant application to address the identified gaps in the utilization of technology for HIV/TB related research and care in Uganda, in collaboration with colleagues from Duke University. The project will provide baseline information on the current utilisation of biomedical technology for HIV/TB research in these settings that will form the basis for the future graduate level biomedical engineering training program. This program will further strengthen the human resource for research capacity building efforts and supported by the United States Government towards achieving an AIDs free generation in sub-Saharan Africa. The project will leverage the expertise from Duke University and other ongoing projects at Makerere University College of Health Sciences to fully exploit the opportunities for technological innovation offered large numbers of HIV/TB positive individuals in the country. Finally, the human resource for research capacity for biomedical engineering developed from the future training program will open up the untapped sub-Saharan African market for low cost, high volume technologies to the global technological industry using appropriate/innovative investment arrangements."

"9396903","Project Summary / Abstract Decision-making is central to cognition. It relies on an animal's neural circuitry to integrate information from multiple sensory inputs to arrive at an activity state that guides subsequent behavioral choice. Given the derangement of decision-making processes in patients of mental illnesses like schizophrenia, understanding how neural circuits enable decision-making may help to unravel these diseases. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans offers an excellent model system to study the representation of decision-making in neural activity. It has a simplified nervous system comprising 302 neurons with known connectivity and readily available genetic tools that enable us to monitor and manipulate the activity of single neurons in freely behaving animals. Furthermore, the C. elegans genome contains homologs to genes critical for human nervous system function such as neurotransmitters and ion channels, suggesting that a functional dissection of decision-making in C. elegans could translate to humans in meaningful ways. When C. elegans is exposed to pathogenic bacteria during its first larval stage after hatching, it becomes ?imprinted? to form a lifelong aversive association with the smell of those bacteria. Imprinted adult C. elegans given a choice between the pathogenic bacteria and a harmless kind of bacteria selectively avoid the pathogen, whereas naïve animals do not. Strikingly, the pathogen odor alone remains attractive to imprinted animals, suggesting they make a true decision to avoid pathogen odors by evaluating alternatives. To understand the neuronal and molecular mechanisms that mediate this choice behavior, we propose the following specific aims: 1) to characterize imprinted pathogen avoidance decision behavior by the navigational maneuvers that comprise it; 2) to link activity of key neurons with decision-making behavior using calcium imaging and optogenetics; The completion of these specific aims will yield fundamental insights into the ways circuits represent behavioral outcomes and how learning functionally alters circuits to generate different behaviors from identical sensory inputs. This research plan will provide the ideal training to become an independent researcher studying neural circuits and behavior."
"9274387","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to launch a Training and Research Program on HIV and TB in India at the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt-India-HTRTP). This new Pitt-India-HTRTP program will operate in collaboration with our partners at LEPRA Society (LepS), Hyderabad, India, one of the major research and clinical centers working on HIV and TB. Over the last couple of years, researchers from the University of Pittsburgh have been working with the investigators at LepS in conducting community based prevention studies and developing novel rapid diagnosis of TB. LepS is a 90-year old non-governmental organization providing healthcare services to rural populations of India inflicted with TB, Leprosy, HIV and Malaria. Recently, LepS started a research center to complement its clinical activities, but there is still an acute shortage of scholars and physicians with knowledge in modern research (laboratory, clinical, and behavioral sciences) to meet the ever-growing public health challenges of preventing and controlling drug resistant and normal TB in HIV infected populations. Based on comprehensive needs assessment by LepS management in conjunction with the ongoing research programs at the University of Pittsburgh, we identified multiple areas in which LepS workers can be trained to further their research capacity. Goal of the Pitt-India-HTRTP is to enhance the research capacity of LepS by training health care professionals in multidisciplinary cutting-edge research, publish pioneering research as well as participate in clinical trials to improve control of HIV and TB in India. The proposed training program will be led by Dr. Phalguni Gupta, Professor, Department of Infectious Diseases and Microbiology (IDM) and Co- Directors, Drs. Velpandi Ayyavoo, Professor of IDM with expertise in HIV, Anil Ojha, Assistant Professor of IDM with expertise in TB, and Todd Reinhart, Professor of IDM with expertise in HIV immunology. In addition, a joint Training Advisory Committee from the University of Pittsburgh, LepS, and the Government-affiliated research and health-policy institutions in India will provide ongoing critical evaluations of the program structure, recruitment, research plans, and placement. While most of the long-term training (leading to degrees) and short-term training will be at the University of Pittsburgh, some short-term training in clinical and basic sciences wil be provided through our partners at the National Institute for Research in Tuberculosis (NIRT), and Center for DNA fingerprinting and Diagnostics (CDFD) in India for only those trainees who cannot travel to the US. The proposed Program offers a unique opportunity for the coordinated, interdisciplinary training of health professionals from India in HIV/TB research in epidemiology, behavioral sciences, and laboratory sciences. Through this Pitt-India-HTRTP training program, health care professionals at LepS will gain knowledge about innovative research in HIV, TB and HIV/TB co-infections, and conduct clinical trials in these areas, sensitive diagnosis, and optimum treatment modalities against these infections. These enhancements will enable LepS to make informed policy decision on implementing effective control programs against HIV and TB."
"9303855","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Department of Neurology at Columbia University Medical Center serves as a rich site for multidisciplinary neurological research, with particular focus on disorders associated with the aging nervous system. In this proposal, the Brief Research in Aging and Interdisciplinary Neurosciences (BRAIN) program, we have developed a comprehensive approach to develop a formal research program for predoctoral students early in developing careers in biomedical, behavioral and clinical research. The work will be collaboratively approached through brief but intensive mentored summer research training experiences for these students, with the potential for subsequent development of a longitudinal research program. The research training will provide opportunities in basic, behavioral and clinical research through ongoing research in the fields of basic neuroscience, neuropathology, neurogenetics, neuropsychology, stroke, Alzheimer disease and related disorders, motor neuron disease, Parkinson disease and related disorders, and epilepsy, as well as neurologic clinical trials treating patients with these disorders. In addition, a comprehensive structured research education curriculum will be given over the course of the intense research experience, with topics including good clinical practice, basic research methodologies, introductions to abstract authorship and poster presentations, and introduction of statistical concepts and approach to analyses, as well as epidemiologic and pathophysiologic reviews of the most common neurologic disorders associated with aging and thus likely to be studied. Our institution has the strongest track record of developing academic neurologists of anywhere worldwide, and such a short-term, intense program will build upon this wealth of resources through hands-on introductions to neurological research, comprehensive review of principles of research, and thus assure the best opportunity for these students to develop research careers in the field."
"9238500","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified statistically significant associations of common genetic variants with a variety of complex diseases and risk factors, these common variants typically explain only 5-10% of the genetic contribution to the phenotypic variance. The residual genetic variance, the missing heritability, may have several sources and is in part attributed to rare variants. As a means of performing association studies in large populations, a panel of variants derived from the exome sequencing of over 12,000 subjects has been used to create an Illumina Infinium genotyping array, the ExomeChip, which features non-synonymous, non-sense, and splice-site coding-region rare or infrequent variants. The analytic challenges and the sample size requirements for the high-quality analysis of these rare coding-region variants will require novel organizational structures and collaborations. In the GWAS era, one of the most successful and productive collaborations has been the CHARGE Consortium, which facilitated prospectively planned GWAS meta-analyses of multiple phenotypes among large cohort studies. The original five CHARGE cohorts and four collaborating cohorts have jointly-called ExomeChip genotype data on more than 50,000 participants. While the cohorts have been able to reallocate funding (with Institute approval) to generate the rare variant data, there are no additional funds available in existing sources to address analytic issues, to coordinate efforts, or to implement the analysis of the ExomeChip data. The CHARGE collaboration, which takes advantage of the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in these cohort studies, represents a unique resource for genetic studies. The phenotype-specific Working Groups take the lead in choosing and harmonizing phenotypes. The CHARGE Analysis Committee members not only provide recommendations for analytic methods, but they also solve analytic problems, conduct cohort-specific analysis, and implement consortium- wide prospectively planned meta-analyses. In the GWAS era, these methods and this organizational structure enabled the CHARGE investigators to accelerate the discovery of genetic association for common variants. Using the available ExomeChip coding-region genotype data from 9 well-phenotyped cohorts, the primary aim is to discover novel candidate genes and putative functional variants for high-priority heart, lung and blood phenotypes in multi-ethnic cohorts. The main activities include the selection of high-priority phenotypes, the appraisal and dissemination of analytic methods, the conduct of rare-variant analyses within each cohort, the meta-analysis of cohort-specific findings, both within and between ethnic groups, analysis of family data, pathway analyses, efforts to identify analytic problems, publication of findings, and the public release of source code and methods appraisals. We expect to complete at least 3-4 major analyses each year. The findings will be used to better understand biological pathways that may identify therapeutic targets."
"9272352","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) may quadruple worldwide by 2050, but there is no effective treatment available. The AD hallmark lesions are plaques made of A? peptides and tangles of phosphorylated tau (p-tau). [A? immunization has effectively eliminated its target in brains even in AD patients, albeit questions remain about its efficacy and trial design. Tauopathy correlates well with memory decline in AD and also is a defining feature of other tauopathies. Moreover, active or passive immunization against p-tau tangle epitopes or tau seeding shows promising efficacy in mouse models. However, since neuronal dysfunction long precedes tangle formation, immunotherapies specifically against the early pathogenic pretangle events that lead to memory loss in AD are being actively pursued.] Notably, an early event in AD tauopathy is tau hyperphosphorylation especially on Ser/Thr-Pro motifs. We have previously found that the phosphorylated Thr231-Pro motif in tau (pT231-tau) exists in the cis and trans conformations, and also identified the unique prolyl isomerase Pin1 to accelerate their conversion to prevent p-tau misfolded and inhibit tauopathy. Furthermore, Pin1 is inhibited by multiple mechanisms in human MCI and AD neurons, whereas the Pin1 SNP that prevents its down-regulation is associated with delayed AD onset. In addition, human Pin1 is located at 19p13.2 associated with late-onset AD pT231-tau is at the beginning of sequential p-tau epitopes in AD pretangle neurons and pT231-tau in CSF correlates with memory loss and tracks MCI conversion to AD. These results suggest that pT231-tau is a very early disease-initiating event in AD. [We have recently developed a novel technology to generate the first cis and trans pT231-tau polyclonal antibodies, and identified the previously unrecognized early pathogenic cis tau that leads to tauopathy in MCI and AD. We now created neutralizing mAb that effectively removed this early, secreted and toxic cis tau in vitro, ex vivo and in mice. Thus, this proposal is designed to test our novel hypothesis that neutralizing conformation-specific mAbs and vaccines against only the early, secreted and toxic cis p-tau while leaving the healthy trans untouched may be highly efficacious and specific in halting or even preventing tauopathy in AD. Aim 1 will further identify the best cis and trans mAbs and evaluate their efficacy and mechanisms in neutralizing the ability of p-tau to induce and spread neurotoxicity in vitro and ex vivo. Aim 2 will evaluate the effects of cis and trans pT231-tau mAbs on tauopathy in two different but complementary mouse models of tauopathy. Aim 3 will develop and evaluate the effects of cis and trans pT231-tau vaccines on tauopathy in two mouse models of tauopathy. The expected outcomes would constitute innovative conformation-specific immunotherapies against the very early, secreted and toxic cis pT231-tau in tauopathy, raising the unique opportunity of halting or preventing tauopathy and memory loss in AD patients at early stages. This research can offer a unique approach for therapeutics directed specifically against the early pathogenic misfolded proteins in AD.]"
"9379029","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The murine double minute (Mdm2) is overexpressed frequently in human malignancies, which contributes to tumor progression through p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms. In the kinase signaling cascades that regulate Mdm2 activity are not well defined in response to growth factors. We have found that Mdm2 is regulated by c-Src, which converts Mdm2 to a neddylating enzyme, which increases the half-life of Mdm2. Moreover, Mdm2 can bind to the tumor suppressor von Hippel Lindau (pVHL). Mdm2 can conjugate nedd8 to pVHL and p53. The role of Mdm2 in regulating pVHL and p53 prevents the induction of the tumor suppressor Maspin. Thus, our central hypothesis is cell surface signaling pathways change Mdm2 to a neddylating enzyme, which then blocks the formation of the p53-pVHL complex and induction of downstream effectors Experiments in Aim1 will determine whether Src phosphorylation changes Mdm2 to a neddylating enzyme. Experiments in Aim2 will establish a p53/pVHL/Maspin tumor suppressor network and show whether Mdm2 can regulate p53 and/or pVHL to prevent Maspin induction. Together our studies will show several novel pathways: kinase mediated-neddylating activity of Mdm2; anti-angiogenic p53/pVHL/Maspin network; and Mdm2 preventing pVHL from integrating into the p53/pVHL/Maspin pathway for tumor progression. Results from these studies will reveal several undiscovered pathways that will ultimately lead to improved therapies to target these pathways to improve patient outcomes."

"9275446","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         There is a fundamental gap in understanding the biobehavioral mechanism of pain in Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) related to combat. While a large body of literature suggests that individuals with PTSD experience increased pain sensitivity, others have shown that individuals with PTSD display pain analgesia. By addressing this controversy and filling this gap in our understanding, we can identify biological markers of pain in combat-related PTSD. This understanding will have the long-term goal of allowing for developing scientifically based therapeutic intervention trials for Veterans suffering from PTSD. The objective of this application is to gain a comprehensive understanding of pain in combat-related PTSD by relating subjective self- report and objective brain responses to experimental pain in Veterans with PTSD. Our central hypothesis is that Veterans with PTSD compared to both Veterans with chronic pain and traumatized Veterans without PTSD, will show complex response to pain demonstrating both, initial hypersensitivity, i.e., increased subjective and objective brain responses to pain that wil be mediated by arousal, as well as subsequent pain analgesia, i.e., attenuated subjective and objective brain response to repeated pain that will be mediated by avoidance. This hypothesis was formulated on the basis of preliminary data produced in the applicant's laboratory. The rationale is that once the dynamic brain response to experimental pain in PTSD is understood, we can build a comprehensive, neurally-based model of pain sensitivity that is unique to Veterans with combat-related PTSD. Guided by strong preliminary data this central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing four specific aims: 1) To characterize sensory and emotional responses to pain in Veterans with current PTSD; 2) To identify the neural substrates of pain processing in Veterans with current PTSD following the initial application of experimental heat pain; 3) To determine which neural substrates underlie subjective and neural changes to repeated application of experimental heat pain in Veterans with current PTSD; and 4) To determine the neural substrates of pain processing in Veterans with chronic pain. This approach is innovative because it: 1) examines subjective and brain responses to initial and repeated application of experimental pain, and links these responses to symptoms of PTSD and pain-related cognitions and behaviors(e.g., avoidance); 2) uses a four group model(PTSD, chronic pain no PTSD, trauma exposed controls, and non-traumatized controls), which is necessary to identify trauma-related, PTSD-related and chronic pain-related subjective and brain responses to pain, and 3) examines only combat-related trauma, thereby increasing power of detecting the degree to which combat stress specifically affects pain processing and has more generalizability to Veterans and implications for Veteran care. This research is significant because it provides a biological model and a set of neural markers that could explain dysfunctional pain sensitivity in PTSD, provide insight into the mechanisms that exacerbate pain and PTSD symptoms, and how these mechanisms differ from pain without PTSD."
"9270726","ABSTRACT To contain the HIV epidemic in Kenya and other parts of sub-Saharan Africa, innovative strategies for identifying and treating HIV-infected persons who inject drugs (PWID) are critically important. It is also essential that factors contributing to onward transmission are better understood if prevention and treatment programs are to be brought to scale for key affected populations. The study will be co-led by Dr. Carey Farquhar and Dr. Joshua Herbeck and is a collaborative effort between the University of Washington, Kenyatta National Hospital, the University of Kwa-Zulu-Natal, Kenya Ministry of Health and a local NGO, Support for Addiction Prevention and Treatment in Africa (SAPTA). The study will determine whether assisting HIV-infected PWID to notify their partners can be a successful strategy for HIV testing and linkage to care, and whether assisted partner notification services (APS) can be leveraged to identify individuals at high risk for hepatitis C (HCV). The primary objective is to determine how many needle-sharing and sexual partners per HIV-infected PWID accessing HIV testing services can be tested, diagnosed HIV- or HCV-positive, linked to appropriate services, and engaged in care at 3 months post-testing. To achieve this, health advisors experienced in APS will recruit and enroll 1000 HIV-infected participants at 3 needle-syringe program clinics in the Mathare slum area of Nairobi. Together with peer educators from SAPTA, study health advisors will inform partners of the exposure to HIV and HCV and arrange for testing at the clinic or another venue. This strategy has not been used among PWID for HIV or HCV, however, it has recently been shown to be acceptable and feasible in the general population in Kenya. Our second and third aims leverage the ability of APS to identify new HIV and HCV cases and use phylogenetics to characterize modes of transmission and risk factors for ongoing HIV and HCV transmission in this key population. Blood spots will be collected on filter paper from 1000 HIV-infected and 1000 HCV-infected PWID in the network and HIV and HCV will be sequenced at the University of KwaZulu-Natal research laboratory. This type of molecular epidemiology approach has not been used in this population for HIV or HCV and holds great promise when combined with collection of sociodemographic and behavioral data for defining population level factors contributing significantly to onward transmission of these two viruses. We anticipate that our results will shape the success of future prevention efforts in Kenya and sub-Saharan Africa by enabling public health programs to target high-risk clusters, and this will in turn pave the way for more in-depth research on effective screening and service delivery PWID."
"9275405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cognitive impairment has been identified as a type 2 diabetes (T2D) complication. T2D has consistently been associated with increased risk for dementia and cognitive decline. Our recent studies suggest biological mechanisms through which this risk can be remedied. Diabetic persons treated with both insulin and other hypoglycemic medications, but not with either agent alone, have significantly less Alzheimer's Disease (AD) neuropathology than matched non- diabetic persons. The insulin receptor signaling pathway (IRSP) is a promising and biologically plausible mechanism by which the treatment of diabetes with combination therapy might affect the neurobiological substrates of cognitive impairment and dementia in elderly persons with and without diabetes. Studies examining the brain IRSP in diabetes and AD show that its functioning is significantly altered. This study will build on the experience of the JJ Peters VAMC and Mount Sinai School of Medicine Brain Bank and the neurobiology laboratories at the JJP-VAMC. Brain gene (Aim 1) and protein (Aim 2) expression studies of several key mediators and effectors in the IRSP (e.g., IR, IGF-1R, IRS1, IRS2, AKT1-3, GSK3?, FOXO1, and ?-Catenin), in postmortem brain specimens (superior temporal gyrus, hippocampus and occipital cortex), will compare diabetic subjects treated with combination therapy to matched diabetic subjects treated with insulin only, hypoglycemic medication only, and to non-diabetic subjects with and without AD-dementia. Relationships of expression alterations with cognitive-impairment-associated neuropathologies (A? and tau) will also be explored (Aim 3). To establish cause and effect relationships we will compare 8 groups of mice: combination therapy, insulin, metformin, or neither, in Tg2576 mice fed a high fat diet to induce insulin resistance (AD and T2D mouse models) or WT. Identifying brain molecular-biological pathways affected in diabetes and altered/restored by combination therapy is crucial to the translation of clinicopathological result to the development of treatment strategies for cognitive compromise in elderly Veterans with and without diabetes and to the promotion of their successful aging. The public health impact of this investigation to our Veterans is highlighted by the increasing prevalences of both diabetes and dementia, which are expected to dramatically accelerate as the proportion of elderly Veteran increases."

"9275436","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of this line of research is to gain a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms that determine successful nerve regeneration in the peripheral nervous system; this is a high priority research area for the VA healthcare mission. Following injury to a peripheral nerve the denervated distal nerve segment undergoes remarkable changes including loss of the blood-nerve barrier, Schwann cell proliferation, macrophage invasion, and the production of numerous cytokines and neurotrophic factors. The aggregate consequence of these changes is that the denervated nerve becomes a permissive and even preferred target for regenerating axons from the proximal nerve segment. However, it often surprises people that although peripheral nerves display robust axonal regeneration, only approximately 10% of adults will recover normal nerve function using state-of-the-art repair techniques. This success rate has not markedly improved since the introduction of enhanced microsurgical techniques utilizing modern surgical microscopes several decades ago. Clearly there is a need for new ideas and approaches to this problem in order to improve these outcome statistics.  Previous work from several laboratories, including our own, has shown that earlier reinnervation of an end-organ target such as muscle results in a greater overall level of functional recovery. Thus a major key to improving functional recovery will be to decrease the amount of time that distal end-organ targets such as muscle remain denervated. Another factor that will improve functional recovery following nerve repair will be to increase the extent of accurate reinnervation of origina end-organ targets. The possible role that the denervated end-organ target itself (e.g. muscle) may play in these phenomena during the regeneration period is largely unexplored. The work proposed in this application will begin to address this question using model systems in the mouse to assess both the extent and accuracy of motor neuron regeneration at the level of the terminal nerve branch.  Exosomes (nanometer sized extracellular vesicles) are secreted by just about every cell type that has been examined, and it has recently been discovered that they become a protected environment for various forms of RNA and proteins and thus can function as novel long-distance messengers. Our working hypothesis is that muscle, as an end-organ, elaborates signals that travel within the denervated nerve and that these signals influence the speed and accuracy of regenerating axons. We further suggest that exosomes produced by muscle may be one such mechanism by which such signals travel within the denervated nerve. In support of this hypothesis we present in vivo data that demonstrates that the accuracy of regenerating motor neurons is dependent upon the denervated distal nerve segment remaining in uninterrupted continuity with muscle. We also present preliminary data that exosomes harvested from a muscle cell line and applied to a denervated nerve in vivo results in significantly greater and faster axonal regeneration in two different regeneration models. The experiments proposed in this application could provide a paradigm-shift in our approach to peripheral nerve repair by focusing on the role of exosomes produced by target end-organs. This innovative idea is a significant addition to existing interventions that directly target the motor neuron itself, and seeks to impact clinical and research attention by highlighting the distal denervated nerve as a general delivery device for novel therapeutics."
"9291382","Abstract: Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) carries a high risk of progression to dementia due to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, there are currently no effective treatments. For older adults with MCI, the cognitive problems and uncertainty they face negatively impacts their everyday functioning, capacity and confidence to engage in challenging cognitive activities, and thus their quality of life. A substantial proportion of adults with MCI either take cholinesterase inhibitors or have tried them, but the low efficacy of these approved treatments for AD appears outweighed by their side effects. The goal of this study is to test the efficacy of a non-pharmacological treatment for MCI that involves noninvasive brain stimulation (NIBS). Early studies in AD dementia patients have found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS, a form of NIBS) improved global cognitive function and activities of daily living. Given that in AD, neuronal loss and synaptic dysfunction progress along brain networks, these early studies of brain stimulation in AD dementia suggest there is sufficient neuroplasticity for efficacious effects of brain stimulation. Of the very few rTMS studies in MCI that have been published, the effect size appears to be moderately large. However, it is not clear whether the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), the stimulation site used in most of the prior MCI/AD rTMS trials, is the optimal site for achieving the most efficacious effects including effects on episodic memory. Importantly, when other investigators used rTMS to stimulate a lateral parietal cortical (LPC) site in healthy young adults, significant effects of rTMS on memory were measurable weeks later. Moreover, functional connectivity of brain regions was selectively increased, including the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a ?hub? of brain networks that is affected in amnestic MCI. Because stimulation of the DLPFC and the LPC may each have distinct effects, we designed this pilot trial to have two active rTMS treatment groups: DLPFC and LPC. A third group, a sham-control, will also be included to achieve a controlled, randomized, double-blind trial. For each of the three groups, stimulation will be bilateral, based on effects achieved in the AD studies. The primary hypothesis is that active rTMS (to either site of stimulation) will be superior to sham-control in improving memory. Measures of change in functional connectivity will be computed to examine whether there is evidence that rTMS changes connectivity of the PCC with other regions of the brain. In addition to looking at effects of rTMS on functional connectivity and cognition in relation to the cortical site stimulated, genetic markers will be collected toward addressing heterogeneity of response. To track the durability of rTMS effects on memory, participants will be followed longer than in any prior study (up to 6 months after the intervention). If this study finds rTMS improves memory in older adults with MCI, further clinical development of this non-pharmacological treatment could ultimately improve the lives of millions of older adults who have MCI and are at an increased risk of developing dementia."
"9223625","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alzheimer's disease is known to have a strong genetic basis, but it is not well understood. Prior work on families with dominantly inherited Alzheimer's disease significantly advanced our understanding of the role of beta-amyloid in the disease. This paved the way to a broader understanding of how Alzheimer's disease develops not only in individuals from these rare families but in those with common forms of the disease. Ultimately, these insights have guided the development of new therapies to halt or slow the progression of this devastating and relentless disease, which are ongoing. Our study seeks to find additional therapeutic targets by identifying new genetic mechanisms of disease. We aim to identify new genetic causes of Alzheimer's disease in a large family with highly penetrant, dominantly inherited late-onset Alzheimer's disease. This family has been recruited over the last 11 years by researchers at the NIA-funded Emory Alzheimer's Disease Research Center. We currently have recruited 143 individuals, including 112 who have donated biological specimens, who span 10 generations from the original founders in 3 major branches. Genetic screening revealed no family member with an AD-causing mutation. In our proposal, we marry cutting-edge technology and classical genetic techniques to discover the AD-causing gene in a large multi-generational family. Because individuals in this pedigree are distantly related but continue to transmit AD as a dominantly inherited trait, we hypothesize that they share a rare or previously described AD-causing mutation. To test this hypothesis, we propose to identify all rare or previously described genetic variants among 12 distantly related affected members of this kindred using whole-exome sequencing. Next, we will test whether variants that are shared among the 12 affected individuals co-segregate with AD in the entire pedigree. Because there are approximately 10 generations separating affected individuals any variant that co-segregates with AD in the entire pedigree is likely causal since it is highly unlikely that a variant would co-segregate with AD ove that many generations by chance alone. To better understand the role of the gene containing the co-segregating variant in AD, we will examine the (1) expression of the gene in post- mortem tissue and (2) determine the genetic contribution of the gene to AD using an independent cohort."
"9268546","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synaptic dysfunction and Aß accumulation are the key features of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathology. Numerous studies have shown that Aß can be produced in activity-dependent manner, and this correlates with synaptic vesicle exocytosis. PS1/g-secretase is present at the synaptic terminals, and our preliminary data show that it changes its conformation rapidly and reversibly in concert with synaptic activity and calcium (Ca2+) influx. Presenilin 1 (PS1) is the catalytic component of ?-secretase, which liberates the C-terminus of Aß peptide, and thus determines both amount of Aß and which Aß species will be produced: Aß40 or the longer, highly fibrillogenic and neurotoxic Aß42. However, the cell biological mechanisms that control precision of the PS1/?-secretase cleavage site and local Aß production at the synapse remains unknown. PS1 phosphorylation by several kinases has been reported; however mechanistic effect of the PS1 phosphorylation remains unclear. Aim 1 will determine whether neuronal activity/Ca2+-induced phosphorylation of PS1/?-secretase represents the regulatory mechanism of PS1 conformation and function at the synapse. Furthermore, our recent proteomics screen of mouse brain lysates in the presence or absence of calcium identified two novel PS1 interacting proteins, synapsin1 (Syn1) and synaptotagmin1 (Syt1), that showed strong but opposing Ca2+-dependent profiles of binding to PS1. Syn1 anchors synaptic vesicles to actin filaments, but releases them after Ca2+-induced Syn1 phosphorylation. Syt1 acts as Ca2+sensor in neurotransmitter release. Aim 2 will explore whether, Ca2+ influx may function as a switch controlling PS1 conformation and interactions with Syn1 and Syt1. In addition, we will test if PS1 interactions with Syn1 and Syt1 modulate PS1/?-secretase and APP processing at the synapse in an activity-controlled manner. Aim 3 will validate physiological relevance of the newly found PS1 interaction with synaptic proteins in vivo by establishing if it is affected in aged and/or diseased brain, and whether these interactions can be manipulated pharmacologically. This study will provide mechanistic data for PS1 conformational changes, will explore novel PS1 interactions with synaptic vesicle machinery proteins, and will elucidate novel Aß-dependent and independent role of PS1 at the synapse. Understanding these issues is of high importance because manipulation of the PS1 conformation and synaptic interactions may translate into novel therapeutic strategies."
"9275403","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated virus (KSHV) are human oncogenic herpesviruses that cause a wide variety of lymphomas and malignancies of epithelial and endothelial origin. Lytic reactivation from latent infection and expression of lytic cycle genes ar important in pathogenesis of both viruses. While viral factors important for replication have been extensively studied, major gaps exist in our knowledge of host factors that control KSHV and EBV reactivation. We have shown that cohesin and CTCF, two cellular proteins that bind to chromatin and modulate transcription, potently repress KSHV lytic replication and virus production. Cohesin is removed from the KSHV genome when it begins to replicate and depletion of either CTCF or cohesin leads to widespread de-repression of KSHV gene transcription. CTCF and cohesin are chromosome remodelers that mediate DNA looping and three-dimensional changes in conformation. Based on these known functions of CTCF and cohesin, we hypothesize that they impose topological constraints on KSHV and EBV circular latent genomes that prevent efficient transcription and DNA replication until they are removed.  In contrast, a select subset of KSHV genes is poorly expressed when cohesin or CTCF is depleted. Many of these genes have promoters with paused RNA pol II, a characteristic of promoters that are positively regulated by cohesin. This cluster of KSHV genes also encodes proteins that have unique immunoevasive and growth promoting functions. Several of them are immunomodulatory and act as viral cytokines that blunt the host antiviral response. Others downregulate surface molecules on KSHV-infected cells rendering them less prone to cell-mediated immune recognition. These proteins are rapidly expressed early during primary infection. We hypothesize that KSHV utilizes cohesin and CTCF to efficiently express these particular genes early in infection and reactivation.  We first propose to expand our studies to EBV, thus establishing these cohesin/CTCF regulatory mechanisms as a general paradigm for host control of gammaherpes virus reactivation. These mechanisms will be confirmed and characterized in unique EBV-infected cell lines from patients with mutations in the cohesin pathway. We will determine the molecular mechanisms by which cohesin and CTCF inhibit KSHV transcription and the extent to which they directly inhibit the physical process of viral DNA replication. We will investigate the molecular pathways by which cohesin is removed from latent viral genomes to permit lytic replication - systematically studying the role of proteins that modif cohesin and load and release it from human chromosomes. Compounds that inhibit removal or enhance loading of cohesin will be employed to validate these pathways as therapeutic targets. Finally, we will define the contribution of cohesin and CTCF to KSHV's ability to express immune evasion genes. We will determine the extent to which depletion of CTCF and cohesin impairs KSHV immune modulator expression and function. We will confirm these findings by constructing and characterizing KSHV mutant viruses which cannot bind cohesin and CTCF at the immunonomodulatory gene locus and the origin of replication. This multi-faceted approach to investigating host control of KSHV and EBV should yield many novel insights into the host-pathogen balance in the broad areas of viral reactivation and immune evasion."
"9268040","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Almost 50 years ago, Dr. Tom Petty and his surgical colleagues identified 12 patients at the University of Colorado with similar clinical symptoms: severe hypoxemia, bilateral infiltrates on chest radiograph, and diminished static pulmonary compliance. The clinical features of these patients were published as a case series in the Lancet and serve as the initial description of the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). This seminal discovery launched a long and productive history of ARDS research in Denver. We have been a member of the ARDS Network since its inception in 1994. Our multi-disciplinary and collaborative critical care research group is experienced in conducting high quality multi-center clinical trials. As a result, we have always been one of the top enrolling ARDS Network sites for over 19 years. The University of Colorado's Department of Emergency Medicine was one of the first residency training programs in Emergency Medicine and remains one of most highly regarded training programs in the country. Their extramural funding has grown rapidly in the past decade especially in the area of critical care research. The Division of Pulmonary Sciences and Critical Care Medicine and the Department of Emergency Medicine have an established record of effective collaborations in both patient-oriented and research initiatives. Building on this ARDS Network research infrastructure, we will create an integrated Critical Care and Emergency Medicine clinical center to effectively conduct clinical trials for the prevention and early treatment of acute lung injury. This Colorado PETAL Clinical Center will exceed meet our enrollment obligations; maintain excellence in the quality of protocol compliance, data acquisition, and regulatory responsibilities; actively participate and contribute to the subsequent responsibilities of the steering and other PETAL committees; and contribute to the improved care of patients with and at risk for ARDS."
"9275408","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The gold standard for the treatment of severe peripheral artery disease remains bypass grafting with autologous vein. However, when vein is not available, prosthetic grafts must be utilized and are associated with very high failure rates, approaching 70% at just 2 years. The primary cause of failure of prosthetic grafts is development of neointimal hyperplasia. It is well established tht nitric oxide (NO) is a potent inhibitor of neointimal hyperplasia. The two main classes of NO donors that have been used to inhibit neointimal hyperplasia locally are diazeniumdiolates and S-nitrosothiols (RSNO). Graft modifications with either class of NO donors have shown only limited improvement in graft function due to a short duration of NO release. However, RSNO remain attractive because they are present in human plasma and can release NO upon reaction with light, metal ions, or L-ascorbic acid (AA). Thus, to overcome the limitation of drug delivery duration, we propose to develop and evaluate a catalytically active graft that will release NO at the blood-material interface for an extended duration of time by immobilizing AA to the luminal surface of the graft. This concept takes advantage of the limitless reservoir of circulating RSNO that will react with AA on the graft surface to release NO. We hypothesize that a catalytically active prosthetic graft engineered to incorporate AA on the lumen surface will utilize endogenous circulating RSNO to generate NO at the blood-material interface and inhibit the formation of neointimal hyperplasia. To confirm the feasibility of our approach, we synthesized a first generation poly(1,8 octanediol-citrate-ascorbate) (POCA) copolymer and demonstrated prolonged generation of NO upon contact with RSNO solutions in vitro. Preliminary data show 30% POCA degradation at 2 months. This is important, as NO will be released as long as POCA is present on the graft. By the time POCA is completely degraded, the NO will have simulated endogenous endothelialization of the graft, thereby abrogating the need for external NO release. Supporting our approach, we implanted a POCA graft using a guinea pig aortic interposition model and found less graft hyperplasia at 1 month. Thus, given our promising preliminary data, we propose to investigate our hypothesis with the following Specific Aims: 1) synthesize and characterize biocompatible AA containing polydiolcitrate copolymers that catalyze the conversion of RSNO to NO and use these copolymers to fabricate catalytically active ePTFE grafts; 2) evaluate the safety, biocompatibility, and efficacy of the catalytically active POCA-ePTFE graft at inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia in vivo; and 3) evaluate the biocompatibility and efficacy of an optimized catalytically active POCA-ePTFE graft at inhibiting neointimal hyperplasia in an atherosclerotic animal model in vivo. Currently, prosthetic grafts are a poor substitute for autologous vein and there is a significant need to develop novel strategies to improve prosthetic graft patency rates. Through a multidisciplinary collaboration, we have demonstrated the feasibility of our approach. Successful completion of the studies described in this proposal will provide an innovative approach to locally generate NO, an important therapeutic agent, while overcoming limitations of other graft modification approaches, and directly lead to preclinical investigations. Once validated, this technology has the potential to positively impact veteran health care."
"9271224","Abstract  The long-term goal of this research is to improve the clinical outcomes of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell  transplantation (HSCT) by improving red blood cell (RBC) transfusion practices in stem cell transplant  recipients. Recent studies from our PPG collaborators indicate significant metabolmic changes in RBC units  during storage that may lead to adverse effects in transfusion recipients. A better understanding of how RBC  transfusions influence the activation, proliferation, and graft-versus-host disease (GvHD) activity of donor T-  cells is needed, as this represents a significant gap in our current understanding of the immunology of  allogeneic transplantation. To address this gap, we developed novel P ?? F1 models of murine allo-HSCT and  RBC transfusion, using defined conditions of red cell collection and storage. Preliminary data demonstrate a  modulatory effect of red cell transfusions on the activation and proliferation of donor T-cells in transplant  recipients: fresh RBC transfusions increased the observed incidence of GvHD while transfusion of very old  stored RBC supressed the activation of donor T-cells and markedly reduce GvHD moratilty in murine allo-  HSCT recipients. A retrospective analysis of 345 allo-HSCT patients demonstrated a significantly increased  risk of grade 3-4 acute GvHD in patients who received more RBC transfusions using a multivariable model that  controlled for other clinical factors associated with GvHD, and censored transfusions performed after the  diagnosis of GvHD. This proposal builds upon complementary preliminary data from murine and human  studies to test the overall hypothesis that early post-transplant transfusion of allogeneic red cells to HSCT  recipients leads to the activation of donor T-cells and increased GvHD. Our overall hypothesis will be tested in  3 specific aims:   1. How does the schedule of RBC transfusion regulate donor T cell activation in murine allo-HSCT?   2. To test the effect of storage conditions of transfused red cells on donor T-cell activation in murine   models of allo-HSCT, and to use RBC biomarkers to identify RBC units that modulate T-cell activation.   3. To prospectively monitor the effect of RBC transfusion on donor T-cell activation in allo-HSCT patients.  According to our overall hypothesis, RBC transfusions are potent modulators of immune responses after allo-  HSCT, and changes in transfusion practices can lead to improved survival after allogeneic transplants.  Completing the proposed work will yield mechanistic insights into RBC transfusions as a novel pathway of  immune regulation with translational potential. Knowledge gained from this project can improve outcomes for  allogeneic HSCT recipients with broad impact in cancer immunotherapy. This project interacts with Projects 1,  2 and 4 and utilizes cores A, B and C."
"9263849","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hypertension is associated with cognitive impairment even in the absence of dementia. These vascular-related mild cognitive impairments are undetected and are commonly characterized by executive dysfunction. To date, no specific treatment is available for executive mild cognitive impairment which is associated with poor outcomes in hypertension. The PI has recently completed, with support from a K23 award, a preparatory pilot study (n=47) to test the feasibility, safety and effect size of candesartan, an angiotensin receptor blocker, compared to hydrochlorothiazide and lisinopril, in individuals with hypertension and mild cognitive impairment characterized by executive dysfunction. Our preliminary analysis which was recently accepted for publication in the Archives of Internal Medicine, suggests that, independent of blood pressure, candesartan is superior to other antihypertensives in preserving executive function. Candesartan was also associated with an increase in cerebral blood flow velocity that only reached significance in those with low flow velocity at baseline (n=23). We hypothesized based on these data to further test the effect of angiotensin receptor blockers on cognitive function by conducting a 1-year double blind randomized active-control trial of candesartan vs. lisinopril in 160 individuals with hypertension and evidence of mild cognitive impairment in the executive domain. The specific aims of this proposal are to investigate the effects of candesartan on executive function decline and on change in cerebral perfusion, cerebrovascular reserve and microvascular brain injury. We also aim at Identifying potential underlying mechanisms related to vascular structure and function by which candesartan may affect the cognitive and cerebrovascular outcomes. Participants will be recruited from the greater Los Angeles Area and evaluated at the University of Southern California. Cognitive tests that assess executive function and other cognitive domains will be administered at baseline and 12 months after treatment. Neuroimaging which includes perfusion (continuous arterial spin labeling) and micro-structure (diffusion tensor imaging), carotid ultrasound (carotid intima-media thickness), and endothelial and vascular inflammatory markers will be performed at baseline and after 12 months of treatment. This trial will shed more light onto the potential therapeutic effects of angiotensin receptor blockers on executive dysfunction and related vascular brain injury. This project will also improve our understanding of the possible mechanisms of action of this class of antihypertensives."
"9454677","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Current therapeutics such as bisphosphonates or anabolic agents do not always effectively prevent or treat osteoporosis and inflammatory bone loss in rheumatoid arthritis, periodontitis, and implant loosening. Therefore, there is a barrier t developing effective therapeutics to preserve bone. During the 4-year parent grant award period (2007-2011), we made significant progress in delineating molecular pathways such as NFATc1 and pERK1/2 in the context of inflammatory osteolysis. In order to translate our findings into a preclinical arena, we screened several drug candidates and identified PTH(1-34) as a novel anti-inflammatory agent. Now, we are setting a new direction for our A1 competitive renewal proposal that seeks to unravel, an as yet unknown, anti-inflammatory function of PTH(1-34) in the context of inflammatory osteoclastogenesis and osteolysis. LPS has been implicated in bone infection and implant-related bone loss. LPS has been commonly used to establish a new therapeutic concept. When PTH(1-34) was delivered topically, we observed that PTH(1-34) surprisingly inhibited LPS-induced osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Subsequent experiments were conducted to investigate this phenomenon. We observed that PTH(1-34) was not inhibiting RANKL through osteoclast precursors, but was inhibiting pro-osteoclastogenic cytokines like MCSF in osteoblast cells. LPS induced phosphorylation of ERK1/2, a common inflammatory osteolysis signal transducer, was also inhibited via LPS treatment. We have optimized PTH(1-34) doses and delivery methods for the proposed experiments. Therefore, we developed a therapeutically innovative hypothesis that regionally administered low-dose PTH(1- 34) inhibits inflammatory bone loss by suppressing osteoclastogenic cytokine production in osteogenic lineage cells. We seek to investigate this hypothesis through two parallel Aims and ultimately, establish a novel anti- osteoclastogenic function of PTH(1-34). In Specific Aim 1, we will establish a novel anti-inflammatory role of PTH(1-34) in the context of osteolysis in vivo. We will determine whether regionally applied low-dose PTH(1-34) in a hydrogel prevents inflammatory osteolysis in response to clinically relevant stimuli such as RANKL, LPS and hip joint simulator generated CoCr wear particles. Osteoclastogenesis will be measured by cathepsin K optical signals and by counting osteoclast numbers. Dynamic bone histomorphometry will enable us to examine bone turnover. In Specific Aim 2, we will define the mechanism by which PTH(1-34) exhibits an anti- inflammatory effect in osteoblasts. We will examine the functional interactions between pERK/cytokine expression and two diverging PTH signaling pathways (Gs/adenylate cyclase/cAMP and Gq/11-phospholipase C). We will further delineate the functional importance of each pathway using pathway-specific analogs, our in vivo osteolysis and in vitro macrophage-osteoprogenitor co-culture models. In summary, we will provide novel therapeutic and mechanistic insights into specific anti-inflammatory function of hydrogel-based delivery of low- dose PTH in the setting of inflammatory osteolysis for drug development."
"9206084","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, a consequence of organ preservation and implantation, adversely impacts both early and late outcomes after heart transplantation. As heart failure is highly prevalent among the veteran population, this area of investigation is of very high significance. While neutrophils are critical mediators of myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury, little is known about their trafficking and activation requirements during this form of sterile inflammation. Utilizing our newly developed technique of intravital imaging of beating mouse hearts, we have uncovered a role for innate immune molecules in donor hearts for entry of neutrophils into the graft tissue of freshly reperfused cardiac transplants. This application proposes to study mechanisms for neutrophil recruitment during myocardial ischemia reperfusion injury of heart grafts and will allow for the development of new therapeutic strategies."
"9203065","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Next generation sequencing is gradually changing the face of human genetic studies. Instead of being largely confined to the analysis of common SNPs shared across many populations and amenable to microarray genotyping, genome-wide studies can now examine a wider range of genetic variants - including more diverse types of variation (such as insertion-deletion polymorphisms), variants specific to particular samples or populations, and rare and low frequency variants. Here, we request continued support for our genetic analysis of aging related traits - with a focus on cardiovascular risk factors - in the isolated population from the island of Sardinia, Italy. Over the next several years, we will use next-generation sequencing technology and high-throughput genotyping to study the relationship between rare genetic variation and key cardiovascular risk factors in a family sample containing ~6,000 individuals (and >30,000 close relative pairs) recruited in the Lanusei valley. As part of our planned experiments, we will evaluate problems related to the selection of samples for sequencing, the design of sequencing experiments and protocols, the analysis and curation of the resulting sequence data, and - finally - association analyses that connect the resulting variants to relevant biomedical traits. Individuals being studies are part of a longitudial study of aging and have been characterized for cardiovascular traits and outcomes, including multiple measurements of key traits such as blood lipid levels and blood pressure. We have previously studied this sample to identify common genetic variants that are associated with these cardiovascular traits and that also contribute to the risk of heart disease and obesity. Our proposed experimental plan presents a unique opportunity to evaluate the role of rare variation in this unique sample. We expect that these studies will result in experimental strategies and analysis tools that will be readily deployable by many laboratories to study the genomes of many other individuals and further our understanding of the genetics and biology of many different traits and conditions."
"9245005","SUMMARY: This research project builds on an already-initiated joint effort by laboratories at Drexel University in Philadelphia and the Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica, Chinese Academy of Sciences, to pursue the development of new classes of HIV-1 therapeutic inhibitors targeting entry and to investigate the underlying hypothesis that antagonists of HIV-1 Env and host cell co-receptors can be covalently joined into bifunctional synergistic combinations that improve antiviral activity and decrease the susceptibility to function- compromising viral resistance. New agents for HIV-1 intervention remain urgently needed to reduce the global occurrence and spread of AIDS. HIV-1 infection of host cells is initiated by the interaction of the Env protein complex on the exposed surface of the virus with two cell receptors, CD4 and a co-receptor that is most commonly either CCR5 or CXCR4. We believe that combined inhibition of Env and co-receptors would be an effective means to suppress the progression of infection, including at the earliest stages of exposure to the virus, and in addition have the potential to inactivate infected cells expressing both Env and co-receptor proteins on their surface during virus proliferation. In our collaborating laboratories, we have been investigating novel peptide triazole (PT) gp120 antagonists and both CCR5 and CXCR4 co-receptor antagonists. Results obtained in a US-China project, initiated in 2013 funded by R01 AI106633-01, established the synthetic protocol to covalently combine CCR5 and gp120 antagonists to form the bifunctional chimera LJC240-linker4-UM15. Importantly, the chimera has a sub-nanomolar potency in inhibiting virus cell infection and combines both the antiEnv and antiCoR properties of the two component inhibitors. The chimera is specific for CCR5-expressing cells, has minimal if any general cellular toxicity and exhibits no detectable unwanted infection enhancement of CD4-negative cells. The results we have obtained in this first R01 period argue that coordinately acting inhibitors targeting Env and co-receptor can improve the potential use of these types of inhibitors for therapeutic intervention. In the work we propose here, we will expand the bifunctional chimera effort to improve antiviral potency and to include newly discovered and proteolytically-resistant macrocyclic PT's (cPT's) as well as different types of co-receptor inhibitors (CoRI's), in particular for both CXCR4 and CCR5. In addition, the mechanisms by which these chimeras can suppress cell infection as well as already-infected cells need to be better understood. In the Specific Aims of this project, we will [1] expand the synthetic effort to obtain diverse and potency-optimized PT-CoRI chimeras, [2] learn how they act mechanistically at the cell-virus interface and with infected cells, and [3] evaluate the ability of the bifunctional chimeras to better avoid virus mutagenic escape than individual inhibitor components. Overall, this project will lead to potent HIV-1 cell entry inhibitors and inactivators of HIV-1 virions and infected cells, and will expand our knowledge of Env-co-receptor engagement mechanisms."
"9282798","Emphysematous chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an irreversible lung disease of increasing prevalence for which effective disease modifying therapy is not available. Patients with COPD exhibit dysregulated and exaggerated inflammatory and immunologic responses. Recent studies have shown that the aminopeptidase activity of the leukotriene A4 hydrolase (LTA4H) enzyme may play crucial roles in the process of resolving inflammation. We have independently demonstrated effective protection of murine lungs against COPD by selectively augmenting the LTA4H aminopeptidase activity with 4MDM, a selective small molecule activator of the LTA4H aminopeptidase activity. When COPD was induced with cigarette smoke, treatment with 4MDM significantly reduced severity of COPD as determined by pre-mortem physiologic and post-mortem anatomic assessment. On the basis of these findings, we believe that 4MDM can serve as a lead molecule for the discovery of novel anti-inflammatory agents to treat COPD. Therefore, we propose specific aims to better understand the target LTA4H enzyme structure, discover new activators of the LTA4H aminopeptidase activity, and determine the effect of these compounds in the pathogenesis of COPD. We believe that our proposed work and expected outcomes will provide potential first-in-class drugs to treat patients with COPD."
"9267349","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of this research is to develop and translate into early phase clinical trials novel immunotherapeutics for the treatment of Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML). Less than half of AML patients are cured with current treatment approaches, and relapse and refractory AML patients who are not candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) have no curative treatment options. The role of the immune system in the control and eradication of leukemia is evident in the reduced relapse rate after allogeneic HSCT compared with syngeneic or autologous transplantation. Since allogeneic HSCT is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, it is important to develop alternative immunotherapies for AML. We will investigate novel immunotherapeutic approaches for AML in the following specific aims: Aim 1: To conduct a first-in-human Phase I clinical trial of MGD006, a CD123×CD3 Dual Affinity Re-Targeting (DART) bi-specific antibody-based molecule, in patients with high risk AML. This study is designed in three segments: a Single Patient Dose Escalation segment, followed by a Multi-Patient Dose Escalation segment and finally a Maximum Tolerated Dose and Schedule expansion segment. Aim 2: We will characterize the immunomodulatory activity and potential anti- tumor activity of MGD006 in patients with AML. Correlative study samples obtained in Aim 1 will be analyzed for (i.) serum cytokines, (ii.) AML and T cell subset numbers, phenotype and function and (iii.) the sub clonal architecture of AML blasts and T cells. Aim 3: We will identify novel targets for immunotherapy in human AML and test the efficacy of new retargeting agents to kill AML blasts expressing CD123 or these novel targets. We will use banked AML and normal CD34+ stem cells to identify differentially expressed surface proteins in AML. We will also examine alternative retargeting agents (CD123xCD16, CD123xCD47, and CD123xCD3xPD1) and effector cells (resting and CIML-NK cells) for their efficacy in killing leukemic blasts. If our phase 1 clinical trial with MGD006 shows a good safety profile with clear and meaningful signs of efficacy in patients deemed to have a poor prognosis, we will pursue further investigation of the approach in a phase 2 trial. Our studies in Aim 3 will attempt to identify novel antigens on AML cells and develop alternative retargeting agents that engage either T cells, NK cells or other immune effector cells."
"9331929","Project Summary/Abstract Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) is characterized by a targeted autoimmune attack against self-antigens present on or within the insulin-producing ? cells of the pancreatic islets of Langerhans, resulting in their destruction and subsequent loss of systemic blood glucose homeostasis. Current treatment options include lifelong disease management via frequent blood glucose monitoring and injections with exogenous insulin, but to date, there is no cure or means to prevent the disease in humans. Significant progress has been made improving patients' ability to manage their T1D symptoms (i.e., various forms of insulin, continuous glucose monitoring, and more), but even with rigorous glycemic monitoring, micro- and macro-vascular disease are common and life expectancy reduced. This, combined with high cost of T1D care, supports a pressing need for a safe and effective therapy. Systemic immunosuppression can offer a temporary reprieve from autoimmunity and T1D, but these treatments, associated with toxic side effects, are not antigen specific and thus, do not address the underlying cause of the disease. Previous studies have shown that combining a short course immunosuppressant, anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb), with daily oral administration of genetically modified Lactococcus lactis (L. lactis) expressing a key T1D autoantigen (proinsulin) and a tolerogenic cytokine (IL-10) (L. lactis PINS-IL-10) prevents and reverses T1D in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice by inducing lasting antigen-specific immunological tolerance. L. lactis PINS-IL-10 is non-pathogenic, non-colonizing, and lacks the ability to produce the essential amino acid thymidine which serves as a containment system to prevent dissemination into the environment. This innovative L. lactis technology is generally regarded as safe (GRAS) by the FDA and approved for use in humans for the treatment of Crohn?s disease. However, anti-CD3 mAb is not FDA approved for human clinical use. Herein, we propose oral treatment of NOD mice with L. lactis PINS-IL-10 combined with an alternative immunosuppressive agent, anti- thymocyte globulin (ATG), which has been approved for use in humans for decades. We expect that ATG + L. lactis PINS-IL-10 combination therapy will significantly prevent or delay T1D onset in NOD mice. In addition to studies of treatment efficacy, detailed investigations of therapeutic mechanism will be performed including cross-sectional analysis of regulatory T cells, helper T cells, dendritic cells, and innate lymphoid cells by flow cytometry of the gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT), the target organ (pancreas), and pancreatic draining lymph nodes; functional assays measuring T cell autoantigen recall and regulatory T cell (Treg) suppression; and in vivo adoptive transfer of T1D. Phenotypic or functional changes in the immune cell subsets responsible for oral tolerance induction by the proposed therapy might offer important utility as biomarkers for monitoring therapeutic response in future studies. If effective, this combinatorial treatment can quickly be translated for human use and by modifying the autoantigen secreted by L. lactis, offers potential application in additional autoimmune diseases beyond T1D. Thus, we expect that ATG + L. lactis PINS-IL-10 combination therapy may present a much-needed low-risk intervention to prevent or even cure T1D."
"9223622","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Lung carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer deaths in the world. Treatment for early stage non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is surgery while chemotherapy is the mainstay of treatment in small cell lung cancer (SCLC). Most veterans present as locally advanced or metastatic disease which makes resection not possible. For these patients, cisplatin or its less nephrotoxic analog carboplatin is the main chemotherapeutic drug used for both NSCLC and SCLC. The majority of lung cancer patients will respond initially to cisplatin treatment; however, development of drug resistance is inevitable which results in disease progression. Thus, development of a new strategy to treat cisplatin resistant lung cancer will undoubtedly have a major impact for the treatment of these patients.  Although there are overwhelming publications in the past decade on cisplatin resistance, but thus far no drugs are available which could reverse cisplatin resistance or selectively kill these resistant cells. We have discovered novel biochemical changes in cisplatin resistant cells which can be utilized as targets to selectively eradicate them. Firstly, we have found that all cisplatin resistant cells lines including primary culture from patients possess higher reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels when compared to normal cells or their parental cell counterparts. Consequently, agents which increase ROS such as elesclomol can push them beyond their tolerance limit which ultimately leads to cell death. Secondly, these cisplatin resistant cells have decreased intracellular thioredoxin-1 (TRX1) levels as a result of increasing secretion under in vitro and in vivo conditions which could be a primary contributory factor to higher ROS levels. Thirdly, cisplatin resistant cells are no longer dependent on glycolysis metabolism, but rely on amino acids and/or fatty acids (oxidative metabolism) as their carbon skeleton source. Significantly, glutamine deprivation or inhibition of key enzyme in fatty acid synthetic pathway can selectively kill cisplatin resistant cells. Taken together, we hypothesize that decreased intracellular TRX1, which results in higher ROS accumulation, could lead to metabolic reprogramming in cisplatin resistant tumors.  In this application, we plan to further confirm and exploit these findings by (i) determine that cisplatin resistant lung cancer cells switch from glycolytic metabolism to oxidative metabolism as their main carbon source for energy and biosynthesis, (ii) investigate that TRX1 is a key factor in ROS accumulation, cisplatin sensitivity, and alteration in tumor metabolism, (iii) determine that ROS generation agent or metabolic inhibitor which can selectively kill cisplatin resistant cells in vitro also occurs in vivo, (iv) determine the possible relationships between ROS, TRX1, and changes in tumor metabolism are also found in tumor samples obtained from patients who have failed cisplatin treatment. To further evaluate the clinical relevance of our findings, we will confirm that a ROS producing agent or metabolic inhibitor is also highly cytotoxic to freshly isolated cisplatin resistant lung cancer cells from patients.  Overall, this proposed work will sere as a novel approach to overcome cisplatin resistance by exploiting the primary biochemical differences which these resistant cells adopt to survive. Thus, by targeting these differences, we can selectively eradicate these resistant cells with minimal normal tissue toxicity. Furthermore, the findings obtained from this application can also be used as a platform to investigate possible ways to selectively kill cisplatin resistant cells from other tumor types."

"9351466","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will investigate microglial involvement in cognitive impairment after surgery and general anesthesia. Cognitive impairment is prevalent and persistent in older surgical patients and associated with higher morbidity and cost. The cause is unknown but CNS inflammation is implicated. Microglia, the resident immune competent cells of the CNS, are major effectors of CNS inflammation, but until recently it was difficult to distinguish between resident microglia and myeloid cells that infiltrate the CNS durin stress because there were no known microglia specific genes encoding cell surface proteins. This is critical because resident microglia and infiltrating macrophages have separate and distinct immune functions. We propose a transcriptome / proteomincs / bioinformatics approach using a recently discovered unique molecular signature for microglia to investigate age-dependent microglia biology during and after surgery and anesthesia. Using such tools, we found there are fewer microglia in the old brain, that they express lower levels of immune-related and homeostatic genes, and that isoflurane anesthesia affects microglia in young vs. old mice differently. Based on these data, we propose microglial attrition and dysregulation in the old CNS are responsible for vulnerability to cognitive impairment after surgery and that surgery. Here we will identify the impact of surgery and general anesthesia on the molecular and functional signature of microglia; investigate the contribution of microglia to postoperative CNS inflammation and cognitive impairment using microglial ablation / replenishment; and rescue age-dependent cognitive vulnerability to surgery and anesthesia by immunomodulating microglia. Upon completion of the project, we will understand age differences in the molecular and functional properties of microglia, the role of resident microglia vs. infiltrating myeloid cels in surgery- induced CNS inflammation and cognitive decline, and how general anesthesia affects the process and defined a strategy for specifically targeting microglia to restore their homeostatic molecular signature, reduce CNS inflammation, and improve postoperative cognitive outcome in older subjects. Importantly, we will also specifically target microglia to restore their homeostatic molecular signature in order to reduce CNS inflammation and improve postoperative cognitive outcome. The work proposed is innovative because it uses state-of- the art methods and technology to explore a novel microglial mechanism for postoperative cognitive decline in older patients and significant because of the scale of the clinical problem and potential to identify new ways of preventing it."
"9444089","The humoral response to malaria is critical in the control of blood stage parasitemia and the breadth of the antibody response is protective against the development of clinical malaria. It is not understood why some children fail to develop adequate humoral immune responses to Plasmodium infection early in life. Both Plasmodium falciparum malaria and Epstein Barr virus (EBV) are childhood infections in sub- Saharan Africa. The majority of children become seropositive for EBV within the first years of life, an event that is normally asymptomatic but accompanied by potent immunosuppression. The long term goal of this proposal is to provide mechanistic evidence that overlapping acute gammaherpesvirus coin- fections are responsible for suppressing the development of humoral immunity during Plasmodium in- fection in children. Using well established mouse models of EBV (MHV68) and malaria the objective of this proposal is to identify how the humoral immune response to malaria is altered by an MHV68 la- tency associated protein (M2), and to identify which features of the humoral response are affected (magnitude, breadth, affinity and longevity). The central hypothesis of this proposal is that the induction of IL-10 by M2 in MHV68-infected B cells impairs the ability of T follicular helper cells to provide B cell help for effective, broad spectrum antibody production to incoming Plasmodium infection. This hypothe- sis has been formulated from our published and preliminary data showing that M2 induces substantial amount of IL-10 in B cells and that pre-existing suppression of humoral immunity to Plasmodium by MHV68 in a primary infection also resulted in an ineffective memory responses upon challenge infec- tion. The rationale for the proposed work is that the development of new therapeutic strategies to en- sure protective humoral immunity develops in children depends on an understanding of the contributing factors that prevent the development of the humoral response in the first place. Guided by strong pre- liminary data, the central hypothesis will be tested by pursuing 3 specific aims: 1) To determine how the response of Tfh cells to an incoming Plasmodium infection is altered by M2-induced IL-10 secretion from MHV68-infected B cells 2) To determine how the breadth, affinity and longevity of the anti-malarial humoral response is altered by pre-existing gammaherpesvirus infection (3) To demonstrate that hu- moral immunity to P. falciparum in children is reduced by acute immunosuppressive EBV infection. The approach is innovative because our proposed research uses novel rodent models of EBV and Plasmo- dium co-infection and incorporates transcriptional profiling of B cell populations to enable the breadth of humoral immune responses to malaria to be determined. The proposed research is significant because it is expected to advance understanding of how the development of immunity to malaria can be ad- versely impacted by viral co-infections."
"9275394","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The impact of overweight/obesity on Veterans' health and VA healthcare costs is staggering and a better understanding of the mechanisms by which overweight/obesity lead to metabolic dysfunction, as well as the mechanisms by which exercise improves this dysfunction, is required to effectively treat these comorbidities. In addition to the storage of energy, adipose tissue contributes to metabolic homeostasis by buffering plasma free fatty acids, limiting ectopic lipid accumulation and secreting adipokines. Appropriate adipose tissue blood flow is required for normal adipose function and is influenced by its resistance artery vasoreactivity and vascular density. Thus, arterial dysfunction characterized by a loss of nitric oxide (NO) may contribute to metabolic dysfunction by impairing adipose artery endothelium dependent dilation (EDD) and angiogenesis, limiting both blood flow and the entopic storage of lipids in white adipose depots. Recently, the pro-angiogenic effects of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were shown to be inhibited by the actions of roundabout4 (Robo4) and the downstream GTPase, ARF6. Here, we will determine if altered endothelial Robo4/ARF6 activity underlies adipose artery dysfunction and subsequent metabolic dysfunction with high fat feeding. In contrast to obesity, chronic exercise has beneficial effects on metabolism that may be mediated by adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK). With exercise, increased AMPK activity leads to activation of energy conserving pathways in metabolically active tissues; whereas, in endothelial cells, AMPK activity leads to NO production that occurs downstream of VEGF. However, it is not known what role AMPK activation may play in improving adipose tissue function, if endothelial Robo4/ARF6 signaling modulates the activity of AMPK or if pharmacological activation of AMPK can serve as an exercise mimetic and improve adipose tissue function in the face of obesity."
"9269585","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is an established clinical therapy for movement disorders and is positioned to grow as a treatment for neuropsychiatric disorders. Subcallosal cingulate white matter (SCCWM) DBS has potential to improve the lives of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD); however, the specific white matter pathway(s) responsible for therapeutic benefit from stimulation remain unknown. The goal of this project is to identify the key axonal pathways directly stimulated by therapeutic SCCWM DBS. We will combine patient-specific diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) based tractography with neurostimulation modeling to enable probabilistic identification of the axonal pathways whose direct activation is linked to changes in clinical outcome metrics measured in SCCWM DBS patients. We hypothesize that therapeutic benefit from SCCWM DBS is dependent upon activation of pathways associated with the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vmPFC) and its subcortical connections. We will use patient-specific tractography-activation models (TAMs) to evaluate our hypothesis by analyzing patients enrolled in investigator initiated clinical trials of SCCWM DBS (FDA IDE G060028 & FDA IDE G130107). Our specific aims call for the development of TAMs in a cohort of 35 total SCCWM DBS patients. Results from these models will enable us to evolve our hypothesis on the target pathways for stimulation and help us to differentiate between therapeutic and non-therapeutic pathways by creating a probabilistic stimulation atlas (PSA). We will also compare our SCCWM results with TAMs derived from ventral capsule (VC) DBS for TRD, as it may be possible that common target pathways exist between the different surgical targets. Finally, we will use our TAMs to investigate theoretically optimal methods for stimulating our PSA-identified target pathways. The results of this study have great potential to assist in the evolution of neuropsychiatric DBS technology and help guide future clinical protocols."
"9409249","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Osteoporosis is a highly prevalent disorder in older postmenopausal women, with 1 in 2 women of white race expected to experience an osteoporotic fracture in her lifetime - a risk that is substantially reduced with osteoporosis therapy. In clinical practice, the oral bisphosphonate drugs are considered one of the primary therapies for osteoporosis, based on strong randomized clinical trial evidence showing a significant reduction in the risk of hip, vertebral and non-vertebral clinical fractures during the first 3-5 years of therapy. However, data are limited regarding fracture outcomes beyond this initial treatment period, and recent reports of atypical femur fracture in women receiving long-term bisphosphonate therapy have raised concerns regarding the optimal duration of treatment. The atypical femur fractures present as a transverse fracture in the femoral diaphysis extending medially from an area of localized periosteal reaction in the lateral femoral cortex. These unusual fractures are thought to develop secondary to chronic suppression of normal bone remodeling and impaired micro-crack repair, with pathologic extension of unimpeded crack progression in an area of high mechanical stress. Preliminary findings point to an increased risk of atypical femur fracture in patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy. Furthermore, while the risk of atypical fracture appears to be much lower than the risk for typical osteoporotic hip fractures, the risk of atypical fracture is increased with longer bisphosphonate treatment duration and may be much higher for women of Asian race. This study will utilize two population cohorts to address two Specific Aims: Aim 1 will examine the association of early discontinuation of bisphosphonate therapy and subsequent risk of atypical femur fracture among women who initiate bisphosphonate therapy. Aim 2 will examine the association of long-term continuation of bisphosphonate therapy and risk of atypical femur fracture among women who have been treated for at least three years. This collaborative investigation, to be conducted within Kaiser Permanente Northern and Southern California, will assemble one of the largest populations of women receiving bisphosphonate therapy for which treatment exposures and femur fracture outcomes can be systematically identified. With an anticipated large subpopulation of Asian women comprising up to 15-20% of women with bisphosphonate exposure, this study will fill an important knowledge gap in the management of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and potential racial/ethnic disparities in treatment outcome."

"9303441","ABSTRACT Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a leading cause of non-relapse mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT). Current GVHD prophylaxis relies on broadly suppressive tacrolimus-based combinations that fail to tolerize donor T-cells. Tacrolimus inhibits T-cell receptor (TCR) activation and impairs regulatory T-cell (Treg) longevity and function. Rather than targeting the TCR, the novel approach tested in this application is concurrent blockade of T-cell costimulation and cytokine activation as a strategy to spare Tregs, prevent GVHD, and maintain graft-versus-leukemia (GVL). CD28 costimulation of T-cells requires signal transduction by mTOR and Aurora kinase, where inhibiting either molecule ameliorates GVHD in rodents. The IL-6 receptor directs JAK2 to phosphorylate STAT3, which polarizes pathogenic Th1 and Th17 development over beneficial Tregs. We observed that STAT3 activity is increased in alloHCT recipients who later develop acute GVHD. Blockade of JAK2 or STAT3 also reduces murine GVHD. Our data support the concept that dual inhibition of CD28 and IL-6 activity is synergistic and offers durable GVHD prevention with intact GVL. Aim 1 of this application will test this hypothesis in a proof-of-principle clinical trial by combing pacritinib with sirolimus-based immune suppression to respectively target JAK2 and mTOR signaling and reduce GVHD. Aims 2 and 3 will test the hypotheses that neutralization of downstream signaling molecules directed by CD28 and IL-6 will yield distinct immune outcomes and collectively more complete control over donor T-cells. Unlike JAK2, STAT3 molecularly counteracts Treg development. We provide evidence that JAK2 blockade permits natural Treg development, while STAT3 inhibition increases inducible Tregs (iTreg). In Aim 2, we will investigate whether STAT3/mTOR inhibition is better than JAK2/mTOR inhibition in reducing GVHD in mice by enhancing iTreg differentiation. We provide evidence that inhibition of Aurora kinase significantly increases iTreg suppressive potency. In Aim 3, we will determine whether targeting STAT3/Aurora is better than JAK2/Aurora to prevent GVHD by increasing both iTreg differentiation and function. These experiments will direct future translation and development of tacrolimus-free GVHD prophylaxis regimens. Our long-term goal is to develop selective immune suppression strategies that effectively prevent GVHD and maintain essential T-cell responses needed to preserve GVL."
"9273277","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It is now evident that many cases of psychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders, as well as disorders of cognitive function, are due to highly penetrant, rare genetic variants. 22q11.2 deletion is a prominent example of such a variant. Carriers of deletions in chromosome 22q11.2, which predominantly occur de novo, exhibit a spectrum of cognitive deficits and develop schizophrenia in adolescence or early adulthood at a rate of 25-30%. Recurrent 22q11.2 deletions account for as many as 1-2% of cases of sporadic schizophrenia in the general population. Because of its leading role in the genetic landscape of psychiatric disease and cognitive dysfunction, functional analysis of the 22q1.2 deletion holds great promise for providing the biological insights necessary for development of new treatments for these conditions. In this project, we propose to study the impact of 22q11.2 deletions on neuronal structure and function in exquisite depth. Our proposed research focuses on this highly significant problem using state-of-the-art techniques, reliable animal models, and patient- derived neurons, and is designed to improve our understanding of the chain of events leading from the mutation, through its effects on neural cells and circuits, to clinical phenotype and inform the development of new therapeutics. A major aspect of our effort will be to implement carefully controlled translational paradigms to test many of the alterations that we find in mouse models in neurons from patients. Along these lines, we propose to pursue detailed comparative studies between human and mouse, using cortical neurons derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) from humans carrying the 22q11.2 deletion. The strength of this approach is undeniable since it will allow in-depth analysis at the level of the individual neuron and synapse, which are otherwise inaccessible in patients."
"9264458","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K08 award application for Dr. Salvatore Spina, a behavioral neurology fellow and clinical instructor at the University of California, San Francisco, Memory and Aging Center who is establishing himself as an independent investigator as a clinician-scientist focusing on neuropathological substrates of brain network dysfunction. This K08 award will provide Dr. Spina with the necessary support to accomplish the following: (1) gain expertise in molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration; (2) develop proficiency in the use of structural and functional MRI methodologies; (3) gain expertise in the use of cutting-edge methodologies for quantification of molecular markers of degeneration by the use of an innovative multiplexed fluorescence platform; (4) gain experience on the significance of proteomics and mass-spectrometry data of protein post-translational modifications as they relate to neurodegeneration; (5) advance his knowledge of biostatistics; and (6) develop an independent research career. To achieve these goals, Dr. Spina has assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team with primary mentor Dr. William Seeley (a behavioral neurologist with expertise in neuropathology and functional imaging); two co-mentors: Dr. Bruce Miller (a neurologist with expertise in behavior, neurodegenerative disease, and clinical research) and Dr. Lennart Mucke (a neurologist and neuroscientist with expertise in molecular biology and experimental models of neurodegeneration); and five advisors: Dr. Lea Grinberg (a neuropathologist with expertise on selective neuronal vulnerability and stereological neuropathological methodologies); Dr. Eric Huang (a neuropathologist with expertise in neurodevelopment and neurodegeneration); Dr. John Kornak (a biostatistician with expertise on statistical analysis of neurodegenerative diseases); Dr. Julie Schneider (a neuropathologist with expertise on brain aging and TDP-43 proteinopathies); and Dr. Judith Steen (a neurologist with expertise in proteomics, mass- spectrometry and tau-protein post-translational modifications).  The proposed research investigates the relationship between in-vivo neuroimaging markers of neurodegeneration and neuronal dysfunction, and post-mortem molecular markers of disease pathogenesis. The central hypothesis is that brain network vulnerability, imaging changes, and disease phenotypic expression are driven by selective and distinct molecular pathways of neurodegeneration in tauopathies and TDP-43 proteinopathies. We will collect imaging data on a well-characterized cohort of subjects with diverse types of frontotemporal lobar degeneration syndromes and will analyze the correlations with neuropathological findings assessed in post-mortem neuropathological specimens from the same individuals. We will establish correlations between regional brain atrophy or reduced brain network integrity, and both semi-quantitative and quantitative measures of neurodegeneration (Aim 1). We will assess correlations between regional brain volume loss or impaired intrinsic connectivity and quantitative measures of a large scale of molecular markers as assessed by multiplexed fluorescence (Aim 2). We will explore correlations between specific profiles of tau protein post-translational modifications in tauopathies with imaging measures of regional neurodegeneration and network dysfunction, as well as with quantitative measures of molecular markers of disease pathogenesis (Aim 3). This research will increase the understanding of the neuropathological substrate of neurodegeneration and brain network dysfunction, direct future studies for the identification of new potential targets of disease treatment, and provide insights on the use of neuroimaging methodologies for the prediction of specific molecular mechanisms of degeneration in-vivo. This K08 training will enable Dr. Spina to apply concepts of selective vulnerability to the understanding of neurodegenerative diseases."
"9328745","7. PROECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT:  The packaging, transport, recognition, and fusion of vesicle-enclosed cargo is an essential hallmark of eukaryotes, and must be tightly regulated for basic cellular organization. A key step in vesicular trafficking is a tethering event where vesicles are attached to their pre-determined target membrane prior to SNARE mediated fusion by tethering complexes. Multi-subunit tethering complexes (MTCs) are one such categorization of conserved tethering proteins, and are required for a majority a membrane trafficking steps within the cell. However, despite their name, there is a dearth of biochemical evidence showing the capacity of these MTCs to recruit and hold vesicles to a target membrane prior to fusion. Thus, I propose a series of experiments to reconstitute vesicle tethering in vitro using post-Golgi secretory vesicles and the MTC exocyst to definitively observe the proposed tethering activity of the complex and to gain structural and mechanistic insights into tethering events. To accurately and sensitively observe vesicle tethering, we seek to employ a single molecule assay TIRF microscopy based assay to observed individual tethering events and changes to exocyst conformations in real-time. Furthermore, we seek to gain structural insights into the overall architecture of the exocyst complex and the binding sites for various proteins that are thought to participate in the tethering event using negative stain electron microscopy techniques. The information gained from these experiments will not only determine the proposed tethering activity of exocyst and serve as a platform for other MTCs to be tested, but reveal mechanism details of the poorly understood, but essential tethering set in membrane trafficking."
"9275324","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the human stomach. H. pylori infection is associated with an increased risk of cancer of the distal stomach and peptic ulcer disease. In previous studies, we have conducted detailed analyses of a secreted H. pylori toxin (VacA). The H. pylori genome contains three genes that are distantly related to vacA, and each encodes a protein >250 kDa in size. Similar to VacA, these VacA-like proteins are predicted to be secreted by a type V (autotransporter pathway). Bacterial proteins that are secreted by autotransporter pathways typically have important roles in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. In contrast to VacA, which has been studied in great detail, thus far there has been very little study of H. pylori VacA-like proteins. Recent studies provide evidence that one of the VacA-like proteins (FaaA) localizes to flagella and has a role in H. pylori motility, and another VacA-like protein (ImaA) has anti-inflammatory activity. Hypotheses: The overarching hypotheses of this proposal are as follows: (i) the transcription of VacA-like proteins is tightly regulated in response to multiple stimuli, thereby allowing orchestrated expression of these in a manner that optimizes H. pylori colonization of the human stomach, and (ii) each of the VacA-like proteins has a specialized function designed to enhance H. pylori colonization of the stomach. Study Objectives: The long-term goals of this work are to understand the molecular mechanisms that allow H. pylori to colonize and persist in the human gastric mucosa, to understand the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori infection leads to the development of gastric cancer or peptic ulcer disease, and to develop effective strategies for the prevention of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer disease. The specific objectives are (i) to define the mechanisms by which faaA and imaA are regulated; (ii) to define the roles of FaaA and ImaA in H. pylori colonization of the stomach and H. pylori-induced gastric disease; and (iii) to define mechanisms by which ImaA modulates H. pylori-induced inflammatory responses. Methods: To investigate the regulation of faaA and imaA expression, we will undertake in-depth studies of the promoter regions of these genes and identify regulatory systems that are responsible for the observed regulation of gene expression. We will investigate the roles of FaaA and ImaA in vivo through use of a system that allows expression of these proteins under control of an inducible promoter. Finally, we will use multiple approaches to investigate how the presence or absence of ImaA influences multiple phenotypes, including assembly of the cag type IV secretion system."
"9275426","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Prostate cancer (PCa) is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in US men. The TMPRSS2/ERG (T/E) fusion gene occurs in 50% of PCas and has multiple biological activities that can promote tumor progression. We have shown using gene knockdown targeting the T/E fusion gene can markedly decrease tumor growth in vivo. Thus the T/E fusion gene is an outstanding therapeutic target in PCa. The T/E mRNA fusion junctions are present only in PCa cells since these two genes are not transcribed into a single mRNA in normal cells. Specifically targeting these junctions using highly specific siRNAs should not have any specific off-target effects in normal tissues so toxicity should be minimal. We have recently developed non-toxic liposomal nanovectors. We have used these nanoliposomal vectors to deliver gene knockdown agents (siRNAs) targeting the fusion junctions in vivo and seen significant anti-tumor effects without toxicity. However, we need to further enhance delivery in order to maximize therapeutic efficacy since the ERG protein was not completely eliminated and tumors continue to grow, although at slower rates. We will try several approaches to increasing siRNA delivery. First, several chemical modifications of the nanoliposome will be used to both increase stability in the circulation and target tumor cells. Second, we will use drugs that are already in common use to enhance intratumoral nanoliposome delivery. Docetaxel chemotherapy is widely used to treat advanced PCa but is not curative. Radiation therapy is also a major therapy for PCa. Our preliminary data indicates that knockdown of the T/E fusion can enhance these therapies in vitro. We will determine if the optimized knockdown of the T/E fusion gene in vivo using non-toxic siRNA approaches can be used to enhance the efficacy of these therapies in PCa. A significant advantage of such targeted adjuvant therapy is that it will be tumor specific and thus minimize side effects in non-tumor tissues. The ultimate goal is to translate these approaches into clinical practice that will positively impact survival for men with PCa. As a monotherapy nanoliposomal SiRNA knockdown may be useful in men with advanced PCa. Every year tens of thousands of men receive docetaxel or radiation therapy for PCa and fail such therapies and thus there is a pressing clinical need to enhance these therapies. Significantly, the lack of toxicity of DOPC nanoliposomes has already been established in primates. Thus there is a clear path forward to translate our preclinical studies into clinical practice to benefit men with prostae cancer."
"9321884","ABSTRACT  A shortage of primary care physicians makes it difficult to deliver quality diabetes care to America?s aging population. A frequently recommended approach to compensate for escalating primary care physician shortages, while still meeting the chronic illness care needs of an aging population, is to incorporate physician assistants (PAs) and nurse practitioners (NPs) into primary care teams. While a number of team models incorporating PA&NPs have delivered quality care to patients with chronic illnesses such as diabetes, data is limited regarding which clinician team approaches are most effective. Identifying effective approaches to incorporating PA&NPs into primary care teams that care for older patients will require identification of effective PA&NP roles, as well as features of PA&NP and physician interaction (interdependence and coordination) that can improve patient outcomes.  Interdependence between primary care PA&NPs and physicians occurs when they provide care to, or ?share? common patients. Managing shared patients between clinicians requires coordination. Coordination can be accomplished through multiple methods including routines (ex: clinical pathways), boundary spanners (ex: case managers), team meetings (ex: huddles), and relational coordination (i.e., communication and relationships) and is believed to be a key mechanism by which clinician teams will improve patient outcomes, particularly for older, complex patients with multiple chronic conditions. Focus has been placed on improving patient outcomes by coordinating care between settings, such as between specialists and primary care. To our knowledge, however, no studies have evaluated the impact of interdependence and/or coordination within primary care on patient diabetes outcomes such as glycemic and lipid control or development of patient treatment goals.  My long-term goal is to improve chronic illness care for older complex patients through identification and implementation of effective primary care teams. In order to develop and evaluate team interventions, it is critical to address the medical and social aspects of team-based care delivery. Designing and evaluating interventions that address both aspects of team care require a range of knowledge and skills, including expertise in mixed methods research approaches, organizational theory, and implementation science. The objective of this application is to determine if PA&NP and physician interaction (interdependence and coordination) on teams impacts outcomes for older patients with diabetes. My health policy background, clinical experience as a PA, and formal quantitative research training will provide the foundation for the proposed project. I will pursue career development in mixed methods, and implementation science and organizational theory at both Duke University and the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill (UNC).  The specific aims of the proposed project are to describe the methods of coordination utilized between PA&NPs and physicians on primary care teams (Aim 1), to evaluate the relationship between the interdependence of PA&NPs and physicians on primary care teams and outcomes (glycemic and lipid control as well as patient treatment goals) for older patients with diabetes (Aim 2), and to determine if methods of coordination mediate the relationship between PA&NP role, interdependence and outcomes for older patients with diabetes (Aim 3). To achieve these aims, I propose a mixed methods approach. I will collaborate with Duke Primary Care to conduct interviews and surveys with health care professionals from Duke?s clinics regarding the full range of coordination mechanisms used within their teams and practices (Aim 1). This information will be combined with data derived from electronic health records for medically complex patients over the age of 65 with diabetes in order to match PA&NP and physician interactions (Aim 2) with patient outcomes (Aim 3).  Synthesis of Aims 1-3 will inform development of a primary care team-based intervention involving clinician interdependence and coordination for an R01 proposal aimed at improving chronic disease management in complex older patients with diabetes. This proposal sets forth essential development steps that are analogous to preclinical/phase 1 studies that are pivotal to guide later successful intervention trials. Skills gained in organizational psychology, mixed methods and implementation science will complement my prior clinical and research training to position me for success as an independent health services researcher with the skills to design and implement health care teams that improve chronic disease management for complex older patients."

This innovative and versatile system, will replace the old and obsolete RT-PCR cyclers within the Analytical Instrumentation Core (AIC) that are no longer being supported by the manufacturer. Over the past eight years, more than 50 principal investigators and their laboratories have used the AIC's qPCR instruments. This new system will not only allow researchers to continue their on-going studies, but it will also create opportunities for new and original projects. In addition, having the latest software analysis tools and the additional capabilities of the new instrument will further promote the diversity and efficacy of nucleic acid research. It will allow the users to perform a wider-range of assays using different detection platforms at both the micro and nano- scales much more efficiently and will enhance data processing. Dr. Kenneth Walsh is the Principal Director and Principal Investigator (PD/PI) for this team project and is a leading scientist in the field of cardiovascular disease. His laboratory examines the molecular events that promote cardiac cell muscle growth, starting from differentiation and ending with cell death. Dr. Bryant will continue to use the AIC to determine the contribution of natural genetic variation on the mechanisms that confer susceptibility vs. resilience in substance abuse addictions. Dr. Myers will take advantage of the new qPCR system by conducting miRNA profiling to further examine the role of genes and gene regulation in both Huntington's (HD) and Parkinson's Diseases (PD). The above three scientists composed the Major User Group. The new instrument will enable other BU investigators (both major and minor users) to examine the molecular mechanisms involved in various areas of research that include: metabolic heart disease (Dr. Colucci), Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (Dr. Wolozin and Dr. Qiu), diabetes (Dr. Ruderman and Dr. Rameh-Plant), ischemic limb vascularization (Dr. Matsui), obesity (Dr. Jing), calcium signaling (Dr. Bolotina), breast cancer and melanoma (Dr. Thiagalingam and Dr. Cui), dental disease (Dr. Gibson), sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) (Dr. Wetzler), virology (Dr. Connor) and hepatic disease (Dr. Bachschmid). The new instrument will also be used by AIC personnel to continue being able to provide the ?Gene Array Service? for all members of the BU research community. The new instrument will be housed within the AIC's qRT-PCR facility which is located on the 2nd floor at 670 Albany Street. The AIC has extensive experience when it comes to maintaining instruments and ensures that they are in excellent working condition with very little down time. Finally, the AIC has a long track record of having excellent equipment usage when it comes to RNA studies.  "
"9353282","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The neural mechanisms that mediate the decline of brain performance with aging are poorly defined and affect many aspects of normal aging life: reductions in motor dexterity, sensory discrimination, executive function, and attention which impact the degree of independence, number of injuries, and fatal accidents. We will define mechanisms of age-related changes in synaptic plasticity and investigate their impact in memory and learning. Our hypothesis is that in the aged cerebral cortex, disruption of the excitation/inhibition balance at the level of the microcircuits of layer 5 (L5) pyramidal neurons leads to reduced formation of long-lasting stable synapses between excitatory neurons, resulting in impaired learning. We have recently described that dendritic spine density of aged mice is stable, but that their dynamics are elevated in somatosensory cortex. But, we do not if density and dynamics of dendritic spines are differentially affected by age in different brain areas. Also, the mechanisms underlying the alteration in synaptic dynamics in the aging brain are unexplored. One possibility is that the intracortical inhibition controlling synaptic plasticity in the adult brain is released with aging allowing the formation of excess synaptic contacts, many of them meaningless and subsequently be eliminated and making the handling and storing of information less effective. Thus, increasing levels of intracortical inhibition in the aged brain may prevent alterations in synaptic dynamics and preserve brain performance. We will test the following hypotheses: (a) elevated dendritic spine dynamics in the aged brain impedes the creation of memory-forming synaptic contacts and impairs the ability of cortical circuits to store/manage information; (b) age- related reduction in inhibitory transmission at the level of the local circuitry of L5 pyramidal neurons is responsible for the increased instability of dendritic spines; (c) restoring intracortical inhibition in the primary motor cortex of aged mice will stabilize dendritic spines of L5 pyramidal neurons and improve performance in a motor learning task. We will use transgenic mice for in vivo 2PE microscopy and optogenetics in the conditional expression of viral vectors, behavioral tasks, and electrophysiological recordings of synaptically connected neurons: Aim 1 will determine that the alteration of synaptic dynamics in the aged brain is a maladaptive mechanism impairing learning. Aim 2 will identify age-dependent changes in PV and SOM neurons of the L5 cortical microcircuit responsible for instability of dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons and impaired learning. Aim 3 will confirm that the age-related decrease of inhibition in L5 pyramidal neurons impairs synaptic plasticity and learning. By using state-of-the-art techniques and innovative experimental approaches will elucidate the effects of normal aging on the assembly and maintenance of cortical circuits to facilitate future development of therapeutic interventions designed to delay the onset of aging-related brain decline and prolong the quality of life and welfare of the elderly. Results from the proposed research may be applied and used for studies on other neurodegenerative disorders."
"9263677","Summary: Title: Structural Basis of G-protein selectivity in GPCRs using Multiscale Dynamics Upon binding to agonists G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate multiple signaling pathways by coupling to intracellular transducer proteins such as G proteins and/or ?-arrestins. Certain agonists exhibit selectivity in their efficacy to specific G-protein signaling pathways. Such selective ligands provide precise therapeutic benefits with fewer side effects as drugs compared to GPCR-targeted drugs in the market. There are very few G-protein selective GPCR agonists known to date, because designing G-protein selective agonists is a daunting experimental challenge. Additionally, there is a serious lack of understanding of structural information on how GPCRs modulate their functional selectivity for their cognate G-protein in cells. There are several contributing factors to how an agonist- GPCR pair shows selectivity to specific G-protein. These factors include, nature of conformational ensembles of the agonist-GPCR-G-protein complexes, and several cellular factors. Delineating the contribution from the structural ensemble of the agonist-GPCR-G-protein complexes has been sparse due to huge experimental challenges in crystallography and NMR of these complexes. We propose to combine two state-of-the-art dynamics techniques, such as ensemble based multi-resolution molecular dynamics method tightly integrated in an iterative fashion with scalable genetically coded FRET sensor biophysical measurements in live cells, to probe the structural basis of G-protein selectivity. The scalability of these two techniques is a huge advantage to probe the functional selectivity of several agonist-GPCR pairings. We propose to use the combination of these two techniques to (a) identify the structural determinants in the agonist-GPCR complex that contribute significantly to G-protein selectivity in nine different agonist-GPCR pairs. (b) We also propose to delineate the structural determinants that contribute to functional selectivity when the GPCR is bound to a partial agonist as opposed to a full agonist, and when the agonist-GPCR is also bound to an allosteric modulator. The outcome of the proposed work will enable structure based design of selective agonists for class A GPCRs, and also provide an understanding of the biological process of how GPCRs recognize their cognate G-proteins in live cells."
"9314696","Summary Current Population Survey (CPS) data document the persistence of food insecurity among America's children despite an array of government programs geared toward improving food access and nutrition. The significance of child food insecurity (or CFI) lies in its negative developmental, health, educational, and later-life consequences. Yet the members of the US population arguably most vulnerable to such consequences?homeless children and their families?are not captured by the CPS study design. Hence, much of what is known about homelessness and food insecurity comes from research that is local in scope, based on shelter or clinical samples, or restricted to certain kinds of homeless youth (e.g., adolescent runaways). Differences across studies in methodology and substantive emphasis, coupled with an atheoretical bent, further fragment this research and limit its integration into the larger body of food insecurity scholarship. To remedy these problems, we propose a comprehensive analysis of food insecurity among children in homeless and precariously housed families. Guiding our research is a theoretical model of family resource allocation in which risk and protective factors, operating partially through parents' managerial capacity, influence their offspring's access to food. Older (1996) but unexploited data from the National Survey of Homeless Assistance Providers and Clients (NSHAPC) are used to evaluate the model. The NSHAPC client interview contains selected child and adult measures drawn from the CPS food security module that allow us to (1) estimate the extent of CFI among homeless families, including comparisons to all US households with children, the subset of those households below the poverty line, and precariously housed families in the NSHAPC sample; (2) identify which theoretically relevant variables predict the likelihood of homeless and precariously housed families having food-insecure children, with attention to the relative importance of parental capital, parental vulnerabilities, family composition, and instrumental behaviors by parents (to achieve housing stability, obtain government assistance, and facilitate their children's institutional integration); (3) account for the food acquisition strategies of the sample families, detailing the number and types of food sources employed and the degree to which different strategies are associated with the factors noted in aim 2; and (4) probe the relationship between parent food insecurity and CFI within homeless and precariously housed families, which may be concordant (when parent and child food security statuses align) or discordant (when they do not). We address these four aims by examining the experiences of the 738 parent respondents (487 currently homeless, 251 precariously housed) in the NSHAPC sample and the 1,614 children under age 18 in their care. For the initial aim, 1996 CPS food security microdata will enable the necessary comparisons. Most of the descriptive and multivariate analyses, however, will examine variation among the NSHAPC families (homeless vs. precariously housed, food-insecure vs. secure)."
"9249453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My patient-oriented research platform in preventing falls and fractures in older adults has given me the opportunity to develop skills in complex intervention development for frail populations. These skills include analysis of longitudinal and administrative data, qualitative methods, pilot studies, randomized trials, and economic analysis. Complexity Science and Adaptive Leadership models have been informative conceptual frameworks for designing interventions for complex syndromes and healthcare settings. As an Associate Professor at Duke University Medical Center, I have begun to train aging researchers from diverse professions and specialties in aging research methods, however, I would benefit from protected time to develop a mentoring program in intervention development for complex problems in older adults.  The immediate goal of this K24 proposal is to expand my research platform by integrating my fall and fracture research programs, and improve my mentoring skills through training the next generation of patient oriented researchers developing pragmatic interventions to reduce falls and fractures. My long-term career goal is to develop and implement pragmatic interventions to reduce the devastating consequences of osteoporotic fractures in older adults. Environment: Duke University Medical Center is a rich environment for aging researchers. The Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development includes faculty with a wide range of expertise across the University. The Duke Claude O. Pepper Older Americans Independence Center provides research support services; I currently serve on the Leadership Core and co-chair the Research Career Development Core. My research and mentoring activities also occur within the Durham VA Geriatrics Research and Education Center, where I am Assistant Director, the Durham VA Health Services Research Center of Excellence (COIN and CREATE Centers), the Duke Clinical Translational Science Award Center (CTSA), and the Duke School of Nursing NIH-funded ADAPT Center. Research: Key elements of my mentoring plan (Specific Aim 1) include training and curriculum development in my research area to improve my mentoring skills. Specifically, I will participate in formal mentor training through the Duke CTSA Mentor Pipeline Program, run a mid-career peer mentoring group of patient oriented researchers focused on mentoring, and develop a 12 part workshop series on Intervention Development. For Specific Aim 2, I will enhance my research skills through formal professional development and practical experiences in pragmatic study design (adaptive designs, community engaged research). For Specific Aim 3, I will mentor patient oriented research in fall and fracture prevention emerging from 6 current grants and involving 7 trainees. These projects include 3 studies newly proposed for this application. The centerpiece of these studies is the development and pilot testing of nurse-led multifactorial fall prevention protocols within an existing regional Fracture Liaison Service, delivered using telehealth technologies to expand their scope and reach. At the conclusion of the award, I will be well positioned to obtain funding for a large pragmatic trial testing integrated fall and fracture prevention programs delivered within a health system and targeted to high risk older adults."
"9321968","Background: The presence of multiple chronic conditions (multimorbidity) has profound impacts on the health and health care of older adults. As a result, epidemiologic and clinical research on older adults depends on being able to measure multimorbidity in an accurate and conceptually valid manner. Yet, existing methods of measuring multimorbidity have critical gaps. Most existing measures that use commonly-available data sources include only diseases that predict hospitalization and death. These methods are ill-suited to measure other aspects of multimorbidity, including its impact on older adults' ability to function independently in daily life ? an outcome of vital importance to this population. The large and growing body of research and clinical programs that focus on functional outcomes thus lack the proper tools to address multimorbidity. Innovative uses of claims data hold great promise to develop new measures of multimorbidity focused on its impact on functional outcomes. Moreover, these approaches offer a unique opportunity to improve upon existing multimorbidity measures that focus on ?traditional? outcomes such as hospitalization and death. Aims: (1) To develop and validate claims-based measures of multimorbidity that predict decline in ability to perform basic and instrumental activities of daily living (ADLs, IADLs); (2) Using an expanded range of disease characteristics measurable in claims data, to develop and validate measures of multimorbidity that predict hospitalization and death; (3) To compare the predictive validity of our measures for functional decline, hospitalization, and death with existing measures of multimorbidity such as the Charlson Index. Methods: Using Medicare claims data linked to self-report ADL and IADL data from the Health and Retirement Study, we will build 4 indices of multimorbidity using the framework of prognostic model development. Each index will be developed to predict a separate outcome related to multimorbidity, including decline in ability to perform ADLs (e.g. bathing), decline in ability to perform IADLs (e.g. shopping), hospitalization, and death. Predictors in these models will be disease characteristics that can be measured in claims data including diseases, markers of disease severity, and disease-disease interactions. These prognostic models will be converted into simple indices, where each disease characteristic will be assigned a number of points, and the sum of these points will give a patient-level multimorbidity score. We will internally validate our indices using bootstrapping techniques, and externally validate them in a cohort of older adults from the National Health and Aging Trends Study. Throughout this process, we will consult with a group of expert advisors to ensure that we develop our measures in a manner that is maximally useful to researchers and health systems leaders. Relevance / public health significance: Improved measures of multimorbidity that reflect patient-centered outcomes will be crucial tools for clinical epidemiology, health services research, and clinical programs that seek to improve care for older adults."
"9357507","Abstract Alzheimer's disease (AD), a rapidly growing health problem in the United States, has created serious public and personal crises at both medical and financial levels. Developing therapeutic strategies for AD is of critical importance, as no cure is currently available. Accumulation of ?-amyloid (A?) in the CNS has been proposed to play a causative role in the pathogenesis of AD. Dysfunction of the innate immune system for A? clearance is crucially involved in cerebral A? deposition and in pathological progression. The resident microglia and bone marrow-derived monocytes/macrophages (BMDMs) are the key innate immune cells to clear A? in the CNS. During disease progression, microglia turn to a pathological phenotype and fail to clear A?. BMDMs show robust effects in A? elimination, revealing a target for developing A? clearance therapies for AD. In fact, the hematopoietic system for generating BMDMs is defective in AD patients. BMDMs as well as stem cell factor (SCF) and granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) are significantly reduced in AD patients. SCF and G- CSF are the essential hematopoietic growth factors that regulate blood cell generation. Critically, elucidating the role of SCF and G-CSF in generating BMDMs and in restricting A? accumulation may help in developing a cure for AD. We have recently discovered that SCF+G-CSF not only enhances BMDM generation but it also increases BMDM recruitment and enhances BMDM phagocytosis of A?, and ultimately induces long-term effects in A? reduction and cognitive improvement in APP/PS1 mice, a mouse model of cerebral amyloidosis. The objective of this project is to define how SCF+G-CSF regulates BMDMs to restrict A? accumulation and improve cognitive function in APP/PS1 mice. We hypothesize that the SCF+G-CSF-increased A? clearance in the brain with amyloidosis is coordinated through the enhancement of BMDM generation, of BMDM recruitment, and of BMDM function in A? removal. Using approaches ranging from molecular biology to live brain imaging, this hypothesis will be tested through the following 3 Aims: Aim 1 will determine how SCF+G- CSF enhances BMDM production in APP/PS1 mice, Aim 2 will examine how SCF+G-CSF regulates entry of BMDMs into the brains of APP/PS1 mice, and Aim 3 will define how SCF+G-CSF increases BMDM uptake of aggregated A?. Through these 3 Aims, the interaction between BMDM-related A? removal and neuroinflammatory changes will also be examined. We expect these studies to define the mechanisms underlying the SCF+G-CSF-increased A? clearance and cognitive improvement. This project is innovative in the unique approach, originally developed by our group, of targeting the hematopoietic system to enhance BMDM-mediated A? removal by SCF+G-CSF. This study is significant as it will shed light on how SCF+G-CSF ameliorates the defective innate immune system in the AD-like condition to reduce A? load. Importantly, this research could be readily translated into clinical trials because SCF+G-CSF therapy has been approved by the FDA for bone marrow stem cell recovery after chemotherapy in cancer patients."
"9420202","Abstract: The goal of this project is to test how to deliver intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) effectively to convey feedback or instructional information for potential use in neural prostheses. Significant research has focused on developing brain machine interfaces (BMIs) as a rehabilitative means for restoring function to individuals with a neurological disorder or injury. One aspect that has been missing in these BMI results is the incorporation of sensory feedback. Proprioceptive feedback proves to be an important component of natural hand and arm movements. Without subconscious proprioceptive feedback informing the brain about position and movements, motor control relies entirely on visual feedback to ensure tasks are executed correctly. For neuroprosthetic devices, feedback delivered to the nervous system eventually will be needed to improve performance and reduce reliance on visual feedback for manipulating the device. This afferent feedback will provide a means of ?closing the loop? to allow the user to make adjustments and provide a sense of embodiment. The present project will utilize a BMI environment in which an avatar hand is controlled voluntarily using neural signals. ICMS will be delivered to convey either feedback information about the movements and positioning of the avatar hand or instructive information about the target configuration for the hand. The choice of where to provide ICMS is based on existing views of how neural information flows during hand movements. To deliver sensory feedback about the movements of the avatar hand, ICMS will be delivered in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), which has direct projections to the primary motor cortex (M1) and where we know ICMS can be perceived. To deliver instructional information about the target hand configuration, ICMS will be delivered in the ventral premotor cortex (PMv), which also has direct projections to M1 and receives visual information about target objects. In addition, the studies proposed here will test the general hypothesis that ICMS delivered in a specific context produces plastic changes in cortico-cortical connectivity."
"9355562","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose data production to expand, enhance, and harmonize a new, recently disseminated, publicly accessible but still incomplete database for Latin American mortality (LAMBdA). Currently the data base contains about 400 life tables documenting close to 170 hundred years of mortality for 19 countries (see webLAMBdA). We propose to (a) collect missing raw data to complete the series beginning in 1820 and update the database as needed, (b) formulate new methods and fine-tune those already implemented to enrich the database with multiple mortality estimates per country-year, (c) introduce adjusted cause of death information and associated cause-specific life tables (d) extend life tables in single years of age up to 100; (e) use mixed methods to construct cohorts life tables; and (f) harmonize LAMBdA with other mortality data. The final product will be a database ready for use in comparative mortality analyses, estimation of old age mortality models, fine-tuned population projections and forecasts, and to study the evolution of longevity in a region with a singular history of mortality decline and currently experiencing demographic aging of unprecedented speed. We also propose data analyses on LAMBdA (and other databases) to test both standard and new theories of old age mortality and longevity. To do so we use the enriched version of LAMBdA (and other databases) to estimate a broad spectrum of statistics that inform trajectories of old age mortality, to estimate new model life table patterns, to formulate new formal models of old age mortality and test their predictions and, finally, to develop and employ a platform for statistical inference about mortality including multiple estimates and assessment of associated levels of uncertainty. The analyses will shed light on processes that could improve (worsen) the course of longevity in countries with adverse economic, social, and institutional conditions. These analyses will complement and extend those carried out in high income countries and will improve our understanding of trajectories of human longevity.  1Acronyms used throughout the text: LAMBdA: Latin American Mortality Database<website> HMD: Human Mortality Database<website> LAC: Latin American and Caribbean countries webLAMBdA LAMBdA official web site<www.ssc.wisc.edu/cdha/latinmortality>"
"9275397","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cholangiocyte growth and remodeling are critical for the maintenance of biliary mass and secretory function during the pathogenesis of chronic cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC), and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). Cholangiocytes, the epithelia lining the biliary system, participate in a diverse array of cellular processes. In cholestatic livr diseases, cholangiocytes, through the products of their cellular activation, are implicated as the key link between bile duct injury and the subepithelial fibrosis that characterizes chronic hepatobiliary injury. Targeting specific factors that respond to the mechanical stress resulting from tissue injury may help limit inflammation and fibrosis that occur in hepatobiliary damages and diseases such as PBC, PSC and liver fibrosis. Emerging evidence indicates that exposure to cigarette smoke may stimulate the progression of chronic liver disease towards fibrosis such as PSC, PBC, chronic hepatitis C, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Although mechanical stress such as occurs with biliary distention (commonly observed in PSC) and tobacco use (accelerates fibrosis in patients with PBC) activate cholangiocytes, the cellular and molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenotype remain unclear. The ?7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (?7-nAChR) mediates the proliferative and fibrogenic effects of nicotine and can also be activated by mechanical stress. We propose the overall hypothesis that ?7-nAChR activation is a key and common pathway responsible for mediating the profibrogenic cholangiocyte phenotype. This postulate will be tested in three Specific Aims, which will determine whether (i) ligand-dependent activation of ?7-nAChR during mechanical stress induces a profibrogenic phenotype via enhanced expression of miR-181 and -200; (ii) activation of mechanosensitive ?7-nAChR stimulates Ca2+-dependent ACh secretion and miR-181 and -200 expression; and (iii) inhibition of ?7-nAChR attenuates the activated biliary phenotype and fibrosis in vivo in cholestatic BDL mice. Completion of proposed studies will provide a framework for understanding how mechanical stimuli trigger local and systemic responses mediate hepatobiliary fibrosis. The findings will likely lead to new therapeutic approaches for cholestatic liver diseases and a reduction of morbidity and mortality in American Veterans with liver diseases."
"9404233","Abstract Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is currently the leading cause of vision loss in working-aged adults. With the anticipated growth of the diabetic population, the number of visually impaired diabetic people who cannot work or care for themselves will continue to be a major public health concern. Diabetes is known to cause alterations in the retinal microvasculature and tissue that can progressively lead to visual impairment. Currently, prevention of vision loss due to DR requires early diagnosis, regular monitoring, and timely therapeutic intervention. However, a key impediment is distinguishing diabetic individuals who will develop retinopathy and progress to vision-threatening diabetic macular edema or proliferative DR. Furthermore, it is not known why anti-vascular endothelium growth factor treatment of diabetic macular edema is effective in improving vision of only some individuals. Since multiple concomitant factors likely contribute to the pathophysiology of DR, single biomarkers of retinal structure have had limited success in predicting DR progression and treatment outcome. The current research proposal will overcome this limitation by an innovative approach of comprehensive and comparative characterization of both anatomical and physiological ocular biomarkers. The specific aims are to identify ocular biomarkers of microvascular, neural, and metabolic function that are predictive of development, progression, and treatment outcome of DR. These ocular biomarkers will be obtained by non-invasive multimodal optical imaging technologies. The findings will also provide insight into how microvascular, neural and metabolic biomarkers interact synergistically in contributing to the development of DR and other diabetes complications. Future incorporation of the identified ocular biomarkers into clinical practice will aid in prevention of visual impairment, thereby significantly impacting the quality of life of diabetic people."
"9444791","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors."
"9388090","Abstract T cell exhaustion is a state of T cell function often observed under conditions of chronic exposure to antigen, for example in some chronic viral infections and in solid tumors. However, the signals that drive and maintain exhaustion in T cells are still not well understood. Numerous surface protein markers of exhausted T cells have now been identified, including the transmembrane proteins PD-1 and Tim-3, among other markers. Antibodies that block the inhibitory effects of PD-1 are now licensed by the FDA for the treatment of melanoma and some lung cancers, with many more clinical trials still underway for other indications. Development of Tim-3 as a therapeutic target is progressing, but lags behind other targets, including PD-1, among others.  Despite the extensive amount of correlative evidence linking Tim-3 expression to dysfunction of T cell activation during exhaustion, little is known about the mechanisms by which Tim-3 contributes to the development and/or maintenance of exhaustion. This has been challenging, in part due to the fact that multiple promiscuous ligands to Tim-3 have been identified. In addition, putative ?blocking? antibodies to Tim-3 have not been thoroughly characterized for their effects on interactions of Tim-3 with its various ligands. Finally, we have provided evidence in multiple cell types (including T cells) that Tim-3 may actually enhance early signaling through antigen receptors, raising the question of whether some Tim-3 antibodies may actually function by actively crosslinking of Tim-3. There is therefore a need for new reagents and model systems that will allow for the more direct definition of Tim-3 function in primary T cells.  Unlike PD-1 or other negative regulators of T cell activity, Tim-3 contains no motifs for recruitment of inhibitory phosphatases. Rather, our recent work suggests that Tim-3 expression actually increases signaling through pathways normally associated with positive outcomes, i.e. efficient TCR/CD3-mediated T cell activation, at least under acute conditions. Data from other groups indicate that T cell exhaustion results from chronic antigenic stimulation that extends the effector phase of T cell activation, at the expense of T cell memory. We hypothesize that signaling through the cytoplasmic tail of Tim-3 contributes to T cell exhaustion and/or the rescue of T cells in a population of exhausted T cells associated with chronic T cell activation.  This hypothesis will be tested with two Specific Aims. In Aim 1, and based on our previous structure/function studies, we will generate novel mouse models for inducible knockout of Tim-3 or truncation of its cytoplasmic tail. In Aim 2, we will first determine the effects of inducible Tim-3 KO or truncation, specifically in T cells, on acute T cell responses to Listeria and LCMV; in addition, we will determine the effects of inducible, T cell-specific, KO or truncation of Tim-3 on chronic infection with LCMV-Clone 13."
"9265726","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is projected to triple by 2050. To address this imminent public health concern, in 2011 the NIA-AA published revised diagnostic criteria for AD dementia and its anteceding stage, mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These criteria allow providers to determine the likelihood that a patient's cognitive impairment is due to AD using biomarkers of cerebral amyloidosis (e.g. via Amyloid PET) and neurodegeneration (e.g. hippocampal atrophy via structural MRI). Recent tests of these criteria indicate that MCI patients who have biomarker evidence of neurodegeneration are likely to develop dementia, irrespective of amyloidosis. Thus, given the consequential impact of neurodegeneration on dementia onset, the proposed study seeks to address the need for complementary biomarkers of neurodegeneration that can provide specific topographical and neurobiological correlates of cognitive deficits in MCI. The Applicant proposes to develop white matter tract integrity (WMTI) biomarkers of neurodegeneration derived from the biophysical modeling of diffusional kurtosis imaging (DKI) parameters. Study participants will be composed of 80 clinically diagnosed MCI patients who will undergo a clinical evaluation, neuropsychological testing, MRI, and a 2-year follow-up clinical evaluation for diagnostic confirmation. The study aims to determine the extent WMTI metrics of axonal density and myelin integrity detect neurodegeneration throughout the brain beyond hippocampal atrophy, correlate with psychometrically sophisticated tests of memory, language, and executive functions, and complement other investigational MRI biomarkers of neurodegeneration (i.e. cortical atrophy, functional connectivity). The candidate for this Mentored Patient-Oriented Career Development Award (K23), Dr. Benitez, is a clinical neuropsychologist whose career goal is to improve the diagnosis and prognosis of cognitive decline in aging and AD. The proposed K23 will extend her prior training in quantitative MRI of brain white matter compromise in cognitive aging during her institutional KL2 award. Specifically, she proposes didactic and applied training experiences to 1) become proficient in multi-modal MRI research to the level of an independent investigator, 2) acquire foundational knowledge on the neurobiology of aging/AD on which the interpretation of MRI findings is predicated, and 3) develop essential skills in the responsible conduct of clinical research in aging/AD, with the support of an outstanding mentoring team of senior researchers in MRI (Dr. Helpern), aging/AD neurobiology (Dr. Granholm), patient-oriented clinical research (Drs. Clark and Ovbiagele), and biostatistics (Dr. Nietert). By the end of the award, Dr. Benitez will have preliminary data for an R01 that will extend this project to a longitudinal study including Amyloid PET. This R01 will investigate WMTI metrics as clinical biomarkers of both neurodegeneration and amyloidosis, as recent preclinical findings suggest this may be possible with DKI but not diffusion tensor imaging. This work will address a multi-institute funding priority for biomarkers of cognitive decline across neurodegenerative diseases, for which no effective therapies exist."
"9471715","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1-4) cause the most important mosquito-borne viral disease of humans, with ~400 million infections annually. The mechanisms by which the host immune response to DENV provides either protection or enhancement in a subsequent infection with a different DENV serotype are poorly understood, and this has been a major hindrance in vaccine development. The suboptimal results from the first proof-of-concept dengue vaccine efficacy trial highlight the critical need t better understand the immune response to natural DENV infections and vaccine candidates and to identify robust correlates of protection. This P01 Program applies state-of-the-art immunological methods in the context of long-term ongoing clinical and epidemiological studies of natural DENV infections in Nicaragua as well as Phase 2 and 3 vaccine trials of the Takeda tetravalent live-attenuated dengue vaccine (TV-LAV). We propose to study qualitative and quantitative features of B and T cell immune responses in humans under a coordinated P01 Program including three projects: 1) B cell and antibody responses to natural dengue virus infections; 2) B cell and antibody responses following live attenuated dengue virus vaccination; 3) T cell responses following DENV natural infections and live-attenuated dengue virus vaccination. The overall hypothesis is that DENV-naïve and DENV-exposed individuals develop fundamentally different protective B and T cell responses upon exposure to a new DENV infection or live vaccine. Moreover, we posit that it is the quality as well as the quantity of neutralizing antibodies that determines protective efficacy. The P01 is highly synergistic in that samples from the same individuals and/or sample sets, as well as specific assays and methodologies, are being shared among the Projects, which are supported by an Administrative Core, Immunology Core, and Clinical & Data Management Core. The P01 also leverages a number of existing grants and contracts supporting dengue studies, vaccine trials, and epitope mapping programs. We have formed a Consortium of world-renowned investigators with extensive experience and on-going programs in dengue clinical, immunological, and virological research and vaccine development - thus ensuring a high-quality successful research program, especially since the investigators have a long history of productive collaboration (>190 joint publications). The P01 should result in: 1) Improved understanding of what constitutes protective adaptive immunity in 1° and 2° DENV infections and in naïve and previously DENV-exposed recipients of a dengue TVLAV, which can inform future vaccine formulations; 2) Identification of natural and vaccine-induced B cell/antibody and CD4+/CD8+ T cell correlates of protection that can be used to assess existing and future vaccines; 3) Identification of potential therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and T cell peptide vaccines; and 4) Mapping of novel epitopes and generation of recombinant viruses that can serve as new epitope-specific diagnostic tools."
"9316713","Affecting over 1% of the world?s population, including 3 million Americans, schizophrenia is a debilitating psychiatric disorder characterized by an array of symptoms including hallucinations, delusions, difficulty expressing emotions, and deficits in attention and memory. Despite the currently available antipsychotics, patients suffering schizophrenia have a life expectancy 10 years lower than that of the general population, are prone to substance abuse, homelessness, and are at risk of suicide. As a result, both the toll exacted on the lives of individuals suffering from the disorder and the public health costs are substantial. There is currently no cure for schizophrenia, and research into the causes of the disease, including the anatomical and physiological disruptions in the brain, has been difficult because little is known about the underlying pathology of cells in patients. To elucidate the anatomical and physiological deficits found in the patients with schizophrenia, this proposal will develop a novel model for the disorder by transplanting reprogrammed human inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) into an animal system. During the mentored portion of this grant, the anatomical (Aim 1) and physiological deficits (Aim 2) that occur in neurons derived from patients with schizophrenia will be characterized. Both aims are underway, and schizophrenia stem cells have been successfully engrafted into mice. Additionally, novel computational methods for studying the anatomical and physiological complexity of these cells have been developed. Based on the discoveries made in the first two aims, the independent portion of this proposal (Aim 3) will relate the anatomical and physiological disruptions identified in individual cells to the global patterns of neuronal activity that are disrupted in patients. The proposed studies have the potential to provide fundamental insights into the biological basis of schizophrenia. The results and tools developed in this project will advance the basic understanding of neuronal function, and could pave the way for high-throughput assays with which to screen new drug therapies for the treatment of the disorder."
"9387954","SUMMARY Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor neuron loss and skeletal muscle atrophy. SMA is the most common genetic cause of death in infancy, but no effective treatment is currently available. Reduced levels of the survival motor neuron (SMN) protein cause SMA. Although the SMN complex is a multifunctional machine involved in several aspects of RNA metabolism, its best molecularly defined function is in the assembly of the small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs) that are essential for post-transcriptional RNA regulation, including pre-mRNA splicing and 3'-end processing of histone mRNAs. Recently, we demonstrated that SMN-dependent splicing events are essential for motor neuron function in vivo and directly linked defective splicing of a gene with essential neuronal functions to the phenotypic consequences of SMN deficiency in animal models of SMA. These findings revealed disruption of SMN function in snRNP assembly as the molecular mechanism underlying SMA pathology. The identification of signaling pathways that regulate SMN function is critical not only for revealing fundamental aspects of post- transcriptional gene regulation but also strategies for SMA therapy. However, little is known of post- translational modifications that control SMN biology. In preliminary studies, we have found that SMN is modified by SUMO (Small Ubiquitin-like Modifier) and that inhibition of sumoylation alters SMN subcellular distribution. Sumoylation is a reversible post-translational modification involved in a variety of cellular processes. Importantly, sumoylation has been implicated in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. This project will investigate our hypothesis that sumoylation of the SMN complex is a regulatory mechanism for the control of snRNP biogenesis and other RNA processes that are disrupted in SMA. In Specific Aim 1, we will use cell model systems to determine the requirement of sumoylation for the expression, stability, localization and function of the SMN complex. In Specific Aim 2, we will investigate the link between sumoylation of SMN and SMA pathology. To achieve this, we will study the function of wild-type and non-sumoylatable SMN mutants using AAV-mediated expression in a mouse model of SMA to determine whether SMN sumoylation is required for the critical in vivo function whose disruption contributes to SMA pathology. Successful completion of this project will reveal the role of sumoylation in the regulation of SMN biology. In addition to the relevance for unraveling novel regulatory networks that control fundamental RNA-dependent cellular processes, this project has the potential to link sumoylation to SMA pathology and open the way for future studies of this pathway as a candidate therapeutic target for this devastating human disease."
"9266287","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT?CLINICAL SITE MONITORING GROUP   The Clinical Site Management Group (CSMG) will provide clinical site monitoring support for the consortia  included in the Allergy and Asthma Disease Group (AADG), Autoimmune Disease Group (ADG), and  Transplantation Group (TG) except for the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN), which is handled by a different  contract. Rho currently provides a robust on-site and centralized site monitoring strategy for all of these  consortia, except for Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) and will maintain our high quality of  monitoring activities for these consortia and CoFAR as part of this cooperative agreement. The goal of the  CSMG is to achieve effective monitoring and site management for all clinical trials conducted by the consortia  included in the AADG, ADG, and TG. Rho proposes to achieve this goal through a combination of on-site  visits, interim monitoring calls, remote/centralized data review, and in-house management conducted by  clinical research associates (CRAs), study managers and/or other DAIT statistical and clinical coordinating  center (Center) staff. Due to the specific requirements of different disease areas and their population/study and  research focus needs, each disease group will create a clinical monitoring plan which will provide guidelines for  site monitoring visits and centralized monitoring strategies, as well as plans for training, activation, and  management of sites participating in the Center's trials. In addition, for each protocol, the Center will create a  study-specific addendum to the network plan, which provides trial-specific work instructions, and references to  trial-specific procedures, forms, documents, materials and guidelines. The primary purpose of these monitoring  plans will be to serve as a resource for and provide standardized structure to CRAs, study managers and other  Center staff. Centralized monitoring practices will be in place for each trial in order to supplement periodic on-  site visits or phone contact. This allows issues or trends (both site and protocol specific) to be proactively  identified. Following each on-site visit or call, the CRA will document the visit in a written trip report. The report  describes the activities completed by CRA and site personnel, any issues identified during the visit/call and  actions taken to correct deficiencies. Routine, non-serious issues will generally be resolved by the CRA or  other Center team members in collaboration with the site staff. If site performance or regulatory compliance  issues of significant concern are identified through on-site activities, centralized monitoring activities, or by a  DAIT team member, a for-cause visit and/or audit may be recommended and completed by Rho staff. If it is  determined that a for-cause visit is not needed, Rho staff and DAIT-NIAID Project Management may work with  the site through phone calls, additional trainings, and email to resolve the issues. Rho will continue to leverage  its experience in allergy, asthma, autoimmune, and transplantation trials and existing relationships with the  study sites in order to monitor and manage sites effectively."
"9223586","Abstract Disturbances of the redox environment in various cellular compartments are linked to many pathologies, including neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular disease and aging. Since the ratio of oxidized to reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotides is a major contributor to the cellular redox environment, engineering tools to perturb this ratio would enable the study the role of redox imbalances in driving these pathologies. In this work we examine the fundamental mechanisms used by some microorganisms to control their optimal redox environment, as well as the possible applications of these mechanisms in mammalian cells. A number of microaerophilic bacteria and protozoa lack a conventional multi-complex respiratory chain, and instead rely on enzymes which catalyze a H2O-forming NADH oxidase reaction to recycle NAD+ and to eliminate toxic oxygen from the environment. Since the product of this reaction is benign water and not hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), these enzymes represent attractive reagents to perturb metabolism in mammalian cells. In this work we propose to engineer a bacterial H2O-forming NADH oxidase towards NADPH specificity. This NADPH oxidase will then be expressed in different compartments of mammalian cells, and its effects on cell viability and metabolism will be systematically evaluated. Since no tool has previously been reported to safely increase the NADP+/NADPH ratio in cells in a compartment specific manner, our work will provide fundamental insights into NADPH metabolism and its regulation, as well as into the sizes of NAD(P)H pools in different cellular compartments. Our work also explores the mechanisms of how microaerophilic human protozoan parasites like Giardia intestinalis, Trichomonas vaginalis and Entamoeba histolytica, which lack conventional respiratory chains, control their redox environments in order to support energy metabolism. We have identified in T.vaginalis a natural protein which represents a fusion between a flavodiiron core protein with its redox partners: rubredoxin and rubredoxin oxidoreductase. This fusion protein catalyzes a four-electron reduction of oxygen to water using reducing equivalents of NAD(P)H. Our studies of the structure and mechanism of this fusion protein will provide insights into how these human parasites are able to maintain their optimal redox environment. These mechanisms can be attractive targets for therapeutic intervention, allowing us to combat diseases caused by human protozoan parasites."
"9275399","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Breast cancer (BC) continues to be the most common cancer in women and is responsible for almost 40,000 deaths per year. According to the VA Center for Women Veterans, women are the fastest growing subgroup of U.S. veterans and this number is expected to grow in the next 10 years. Therefore, as the population ages, VA health care will be in high demand by women veterans. This is because some of the same risk factors that are associated with poor prognosis in the general population are also found in the VA population. The VA also treats a moderately high volume of male BC and, unlike the declining mortality for female BC, death rates from male BC have not decreased. Compared with the general population, a higher proportion of the male and female BC patients in the VA system are African-American, relative to the private sector, and this population exhibits higher mortality and morbidity rates. Therefore, identifying effective therapeutic targets to treat these diverse groups of veterans is highly relevant to the VA patient care mission.  The previous VA Merit funded project addressed questions about how breast cancers acquire hormone independence and become metastatic or spread throughout the body. We suspected that this type of tumor progression was controlled by a BC protein (RUNX2) that regulates expression of genes that promote growth and metastasis. We also proposed to discover compounds that would inhibit the ability of this factor to increase BC progression. We found that the RUNX2 factor promotes BC progression to a more aggressive, metastatic form by increasing glucose metabolism, inhibiting mitochondrial respiration, and reducing epithelial- specific gene expression, or differentiation. We also used novel drug screening methods and activity assays developed in the laboratory to characterize several compounds related to vitamin D that inhibited the RUNX2 factor and BC growth. Given these observations, in this VA Merit renewal application we propose the hypothesis that the RUNX2 factor can alter BC metabolism and inhibit cell differentiation while promoting tumor progression. We further propose that targeted inhibition of this factor using novel vitamin D derivatives will restore normal cell metabolism and differentiation, prevent further tumor progression, and inhibit BC growth.  The goal of this proposal, therefore, is to perform a comprehensive but focused analysis of the relationship between RUNX2-mediated breast cancer growth and differentiation. RUNX2 may promote a metabolic progression favoring glycolysis and suppressing mitochondrial respiration. Several specific BC cell models and novel compounds that promote BC cell differentiation will be used to define the mechanisms regulating breast cancer progression and metastasis. The goals are to (1) define the RUNX2-regulated relationship between BC cell differentiation, metabolism, and progression, (2) define how Vitamin D3 prohormone regulates RUNX2 DNA binding and BC differentiation through its regulation of cell metabolism, and (3) determine the mechanisms regulating RUNX2 DNA binding and BC differentiation by oxidized variants of Vitamin D3. Many patients within the Veterans Administration health care system also suffer from lung, colorectal, and head/neck cancers, which are prevalent in elderly veterans who are smokers. Our study may provide insight into understanding the molecular pathways regulating these malignancies. Because the hypotheses we are testing are also relevant to how RUNX2 regulates vascular disease, therapeutic targeting strategies discovered in this study may have applicability and clinical relevance for other pathologies prevalent in the veteran population that are exacerbated by aging and smoking, such as cardiovascular disease. !"
"9274058","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal builds on the foundation established in Haiti during three decades of NIH research and training support to Weill Cornell Medical College and the Groupe Haitien d'Etude du Sarcome et des Infections Opportunistes (GHESKIO). The focus of this training program is improving the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of AIDS related tuberculosis, with an emphasis on multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). A cadre of 10 Haitian clinicians will receive 2 years of research training which will include an MPH from the Cornell-GHESKIO- Quisqueya program in Haiti. We will also respond to an urgent need expressed by the Haitian Ministry of Health for skilled laboratory leaders and establish a 2 year MS in Laboratory Science program for 8 Haitian laboratory trainees. These 18 clinical and laboratory trainees will conduct their mentored MPH and MS theses in the following priority research areas: 1) translational research on M. tuberculosis latency, persistence, and drug discovery; 2) clinical trials of new drugs for the treatment of MDR-TB, including patients with HIV; 3) maternal- child tuberculosis diagnosis, HIV/TB treatment, and prevention; 4) community-based case detection of HIV/TB and MDR-TB molecular epidemiology; 5) implementation science to scale-up new TB diagnostics and HIV/MDR-TB treatment. The program will also train research staff including nurses (6), data managers (2), social workers (2), and pharmacists (2) to participate in the aforementioned research areas. Haiti has the highest prevalence of HIV (2.2%) and tuberculosis (296/100,000) in the Western Hemisphere. There are an estimated 1,540 prevalent MDR-TB cases in Haiti, but only ~150 patients are currently treated, in large part due to the lack of skilled clinical and laboratory personnel. Therefore over 90% of MDR-TB patients are left untreated in the community. This public health risk is compounded by the fact that 1/3 of patients are also HIV-positive. The development and validation of new diagnostics and anti-tuberculous therapies, coupled with a targeted research training program will address this urgent need. This program not only responds to the priorities of the Haitian Ministry of Health but will also train the next generation of Haitian leaders in the field of HIV and tuberculosis research. Their accomplishments will have a direct effect on the national HIV/TB program in Haiti and have the potential for a major global impact."
"9302004","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This proposed project aims to use genetics to help develop an approach for classifying severe mental illness (SMI) that has a stronger scientific foundation than the systems currently used in both research and clinical practice. These classification systems have, for more than a century, divided the bulk of SMI into dichotomous diagnostic categories: psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia [SCZ]) and mood disorders (including bipolar disorder [BP] and major depressive disorder [MDD]). However the overlap of symptomatology across mood and psychotic disorders, and growing evidence for the genetic correlation between these categories, demonstrate that they imprecisely represent the biological underpinning of SMI. It has been proposed that frameworks based on symptom-level and dimensional (quantitative) information, such as the NIMH Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), would better reflect the genetic contribution to SMI and would therefore provide a more useful framework for their classification. However the evidence supporting this hypothesis remains sparse, in large part because we lack the right datasets to test it. In this project we will generate a unique SMI dataset, using electronic health records to ascertain individuals who have received inpatient treatment at a single psychiatric hospital that serves the entire 1 million inhabitants of the state of Caldas, Colombia. All of the individuals whom we will investigate are members of the ?Paisa?, a genetically and culturally homogeneous population that comprises the majority in this region of Colombia. By recruiting 8,000 participants across the full range of severe mood and psychotic disorders (as well as 2,000 demographically-matched controls); performing uniform phenotyping of these 10,000 individuals using diagnostic and quantitative assessments; and genome wide genotyping, we will establish dimensional phenotypes that index core deficits of SMI and that reference multiple RDoC domains. We will then conduct genetic analyses of symptom-level and quantitative phenotypes, evaluating their relationship to known SMI loci and to polygenic risk scores (PRS) that represent the overall contribution of common genetic variation to these disorders; the SCZ, BP, and MDD workgroups of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) will provide us with up-to-date genetic data for each diagnosis. Additionally, we will conduct genome wide association analyses of the quantitative traits, including meta-analyses for traits that have been assessed in other study populations. We will also contribute our data (including genotypes available to us for an additional 6,000 Paisa controls) to the case-control meta-analyses of the PGC workgroups, contributing to the diversity of their datasets by adding a substantial number of samples from a previously underrepresented (Hispanic) population. ."

(2015), nominated by peers. Offering a hands-on education emphasizing close relationships with faculty, F&M has a wide range of academic and pre-professional programs in biomedical and biobehavioral fields, STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields, and public health. The College ranks #49 among all baccalaureate-origin institutions of 2002?2011 recipients of doctoral degrees in Science and Engineering (S&E) and #27 among Baccalaureate institutions (NSF, 2013). Recent strategic efforts have deepened our student talent pool and bolstered the enrollment of first-generation and underrepresented minority students: F&M was the first LAC to agree to host a STEM Posse through the Posse Foundation, has emphasized building recruitment networks with national charter school and college access organizations, and has eliminated merit aid while significantly enhancing need-based aid to lower- and middle-income students. We have benefited from these strategic decisions (e.g., more than tripling Pell-eligible students from 2008 to 2015 and more than doubling the percentage of domestic students of color since 2005) and are eager to create even more opportunities for our increasingly diverse student body to engage with faculty in collaborative research. Increased activity and expectations by incoming faculty and efforts to tap the full grant-seeking potential of mid-career faculty members have placed heightened pressure on F&M's sponsored research operations. Our innovative pre-award Office of College Grants (OCG), launched in 2012, is now insufficient to the expressed needs of faculty, resulting in the piloting of a lifecycle model of grants administration. Despite this shift, F&M still has deficiencies in a. research administration (RA) and research compliance (RC) systems and infrastructure; b. training and support of professional staff; and c. faculty development related to seeking research grants. Hired in 2o12 as the OCG was formed, Director of Faculty Grants Amy Cuhel-Schuckers will lead the transition to a lifecycle model with a primary goal to strengthen our fledgling pre- and post-award lifecycle model and thus provide strong support to our research- active biomedical and biobehavioral research (BBR) faculty. Aims are to 1. Improve pre-award, post-award, and compliance structures and services, and strengthen staff training and professional development, and 2. Provide increased research-related mentoring, professional development, and incentives to BBR faculty. We will apply proven strategies to lead and effect change, including the use of external peer reviews and collaboration with an experienced Mentor from UPENN."
"9270085","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall objectives of this proposal are to elucidate the mechanism of action of different classes of next generation ?-secretase modulators (GSMs), to determine their synergistic effect, and to apply them in examining the role of A?42, A?38 and A?37 in amyloid pathology, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. The development of GSMs that suppress ?-secretase activity for A?42 production and yet do not affect overall APP processing and cleavages of other substrates has emerged as a promising strategy for AD therapy. Progress in the development of these clinical candidates depends on a deeper understanding of the drug-target interactions. To this end we propose to map the binding site of acid GSMs within the ?-secretase complex and to investigate the structural basis of ?-secretase modulation. Additionally, we will determine the mechanism of cooperatively between the ?-secretase active site and the imidazole based GSM binding site(s). Finally, we will examine the synergistic effect of two classes of GSMs in cellular and animal models with a focus on safety, synaptic plasticity and learning and memory. The proposed research will provide mechanistic insights into GSM modulation of ?-secretase, the function of A? in disease and new therapeutic strategies, shaping our understanding of GSM selectivity and advancing our ability to design effective treatment."
"9275239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The identification of patients at high risk of recurrence is one of the most important assessments in the clinical management of breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node status is the current gold standard for clinical discrimination between good and poor prognosis and for deciding if patients receive adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery. However, ~30% of women with node-negative status experience recurrence within 10 years of initial treatment, while ~25% of women with node-positive status do not. Accordingly, there is a need for additional prognostic methods to assess recurrence and survival in breast cancer patients. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor type-1 (PAI-1) have been validated at the highest level of evidence (LOE-1) as clinical biomarkers of prognosis in breast cancer. The American Society of Clinical Oncology recommends using uPA and PAI-1 levels in breast tumors for the routine assessment of prognosis in patients with newly diagnosed breast cancer and for deciding whether node-negative breast cancer patients can forgo adjuvant chemotherapy. The sole validated method for quantifying uPA and PAI-1 levels in breast tumor tissue is a colorimetric ELISA assay requiring a minimum of 300 mg of tumor tissue. Generally, only open (excisional) biopsy will yield 300 mg of tissue, while the more common vacuum-assisted core needle biopsies yield d 110 mg of tumor tissue. The 300 mg requirement also places a restrictive lower limit on the size of tumors that can be evaluated. Accordingly, the availability of a reliable method to accurately quantify uPA and PAI-1 levels in d100 mg of biopsy tissue would have a profound impact on the clinical management of breast cancer. The objective of the studies outlined in this proposal is to develop technologies to rapidly and accurately quantify levels of uPA and PAI- 1 in small tissue specimens (10-100 mg) obtained by fine needle core biopsies of breast tumors. Our central hypothesis is that the combined use of an innovative pressure cycling technology to solubilize tissue proteins and a novel and highly sensitive immunoassay format, called immunoliposome-polymerase chain reaction (ILPCR), developed in our laboratory will achieve the level of quantification for uPA and PAI-1 stated in our objective. The rationale for these studies is that their successful completion will provide clinicians with more reliable means to determine those node-negative patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy following surgery for beast cancer. Accordingly, our project proposes the following three specific aims. Aim 1 is to develop and optimize a method to rapidly and quantitatively extract soluble uPA and PAI-1 from breast tumor tissue using rapid pressure-cycling technology. Aim 2 is to develop and optimize ILPCR assays that can accurately quantify uPA and PAI-1 from 10-100 mg of breast tumor tissue with an assay sensitivity and specificity of e95%. Aim 3 is to validate the rapid pressure-cycling extraction method and ILPCR assays for uPA and PAI-1 against the gold standard ELISA assay by using tissue obtained from the same breast tumor for both assays. These studies are innovative because they will overcome a critical barrier to the use of uPA and PAI-1 for the prognostic evaluation of breast tumors. This research will also improve clinical practice because it will provide clinicians with more reliable means to determine those node-negative patients most likely to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, particularly those patients with hormone receptor-negative and node-negative grade 2 tumors who are borderline candidates for chemotherapy. Finally, this research is relevant to Veterans and the VA health care system because it will improve the survival and quality of life of breast cancer patients. It will also facilitate the detection and prognostic assessment of breast tumors at earlier stages where clinical options are greatest and where treatment outcomes are most likely to be favorable."
"9311685","Project Summary Identifying the susceptibility genes and variants of neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diseases will not only contribute to our understanding of these diseases, but also point to potential therapeutic targets. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are commonly used to study complex diseases, including neuro-psychiatric diseases. Nevertheless, GWAS focus on common variants, and have not been successful in studying early- onset diseases, including many developmental disorders, whose risk alleles are generally kept at very low frequencies in population. Additionally, the results of GWAS often cannot be directly translated into knowledge of risk genes and disease mechanisms.  The goal of this project is to develop comprehensive statistical methods for analyzing genetic data of neuropsychiatric diseases to map their susceptibility genes and gain insights of the disease genetics. (1) We propose methods to analyze exome and genome sequencing data from patient families. Unlike existing methods for genetic studies which often focus on type of data per time, our methods will integrate a broad spectrum of genetic variations at the level of genes, including non-synonymous and regulatory non-coding mutations, both de novo and inherited from parents in origin. This leads to a higher power of detecting risk genes. (2) Copy number variants (CNVs) make substantial contribution to neurodevelopmental disorders. But CNVs often overlap multiple genes and it is difficult to identify risk genes within disease-related CNVs. A new algorithm is proposed to extract gene-level information from CNVs. This allows us to combine CNV data and nucleotide variation data from sequencing, to better detect disease genes. (3) Importance of non-coding variants to complex disease has now been firmly established and expression QTL (eQTL) is a promising strategy to map non-coding variants that have functional effects on gene expression levels. We propose a novel statistical approach to joint analysis of eQTL and GWAS data. The method is unique in that it uses information of all eQTL of a gene to test its role in disease, including both cis- and trans-eQTL, across the entire range of effect sizes. (4) A key component of our effort is the integration of the methods we develop into user-friendly software that could benefit the broad psychiatric genetic community."
"9298063","Project Summary Anhedonia, traditionally defined as a diminished capacity to experience pleasure, has long been considered a core feature of schizophrenia. Modern studies indicate that interview-based ratings of anhedonia predict a number of important clinical outcomes, such as disease liability, subjective quality of life, community functional outcome, and recovery. Unfortunately, attempts to remediate anhedonia via pharmacological and psychosocial interventions have been ineffective. Limited progress in treating anhedonia is due in part to poor conceptual clarity regarding emotional experience abnormalities in schizophrenia. Prior studies indicate that ratings of anhedonia made on clinical interviews are best conceptualized as a reduction in the frequency of pleasurable activity, rather than a deficit in initial reward responsiveness or hedonic capacity. This raises an important question: why do apparently normal hedonic responses not translate into motivated behaviors aimed at obtaining rewards in schizophrenia? The goal of the current project is to answer this question by applying a novel conceptual framework that explains anhedonia as resulting from abnormalities in the temporal dynamics of emotion. A well-validated approach to studying the temporal dynamics of emotion in the context of every day activities will be implemented, Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA). People diagnosed with schizophrenia (n = 84) and demographically matched healthy controls (n = 84) will complete three types of EMA surveys (signal-contingent, interval-contingent, and event-contingent) of emotional experience at multiple time points in the day, over the course of 7 days. Mathematical modeling approaches, such as network analysis and Markov chain analysis, will be applied to the EMA data to evaluate stochastic dynamic changes in emotional states to determine how they interact, unfold over time, and influence real-world reward-seeking behavior. Using mathematical modeling, we aim to extend our preliminary data indicating that reductions in the frequency of pleasurable activity reflect deficits in the sustained responsiveness to reward in people with schizophrenia. Findings will provide a specific, mechanistic account of anhedonia that can be used to develop novel treatment targets for technology-based Ecological Momentary Interventions."

In spite of all the beneficial interventions implemented, renal injury progresses in most of these patients. Additional treatment modalities that modulate the pathogenic pathways involved in obesity and diabetic nephropathy are therefore urgently needed. In this proposal we will test the potential role of inhibition of the sterol regulatory element binding proteins in prevention and treatment of kidney disease in obesity and diabetes. IN SPECIFIC AIM 1 WE WILL DETERMINE THE EFFECTS OF RENAL PODOCYTE SPECIFIC SREBP OVEREXPRESSION or RENAL PODOCYTE SPECIFIC SREBP DELETION IN KIDNEY DISEASE IN OBESITY AND DIABETES. In Specific Aim 1A we will determine the effects of diet induced obesity and diabetes in development of renal disease in a) wild type vs. b) podocyte SREBP overexpressing mice. In Specific Aim 1B we will determine the effects of diet induced obesity and diabetes in development of renal disease in a) wild type vs. b) podocyte SREBP knockout mice. In Specific Aim 1C we will determine the direct effects of SREBP silencing or overexpression in response of human podocytes to high glucose or fatty acids.

We will determine the effects of dissimilar inhibitors of SREBP activity 1) Betulin, 2) FGH10019, and 3) Metformin in diabetic kidney disease. In Specific Aim 2A we will perform preventive studies; that is treatments will be started at the onset of diabetes. In Specific Aim 2B we will perform treatment studies; that is treatments will be started once there is evidence of kidney disease which will better simulate the clinical setting. In Specific Aim 2C we will determine if Betulin, FGH10019, and Metformin have direct effects to modulate the response of human podocytes to high glucose and fatty acids and if these affects are specifically mediated via inhibition of SREBPs. Impact and Innovation: The potential role of the small molecule inhibitors of SREBP activation in modulating renal disease in obesity and diabetes renal disease is very novel and will have major translational implications for the treatment of diabetes and obesity-related renal and cardiovascular complications. Innovative aspects of this proposal include: a) Determine the effects of recently developed small molecule inhibitors of SREBP activity in the kidney; b) Study mice with kidney podocyte specific knockout or overexpression of SREBPs to determine the direct renal effects of SREBPs in regulation of renal lipid metabolism and kidney disease in obesity and diabetes. c) Determine the effects of SREBP overexpression or knockout and the small molecule inhibitors of SREBP activation in human podocyte cells in culture to determine the direct effects of SREBPs in renal cells independent of systemic alterations in metabolism; d) Mechanistic studies in podocytes in culture to determine how SREBPs modulate podocyte cell function and cell injury."
"9286465","PROJECT SUMMARY Despite the critical importance of germline mutation in human genetics, we still lack the answer to basic questions, notably about how and why rates differ among individuals. We also lack a comparative context for interpreting findings, as, other than for one chimpanzee family, there are no direct estimates of germline mutation rates for non-human primates. These gaps in our understanding have important implications for evolutionary biology as well, leading in particular to considerable uncertainty about the steadiness of the ?molecular clock? in primates. We therefore propose to obtain direct estimates of germline mutation rates within humans, in chimpanzees, and in three Old World monkey (OWM) species. In Aim 1, we will elucidate variation in human mutation rates with age, sex, and across families, separately for different mutation types. We will generate and analyze high-quality genome sequences for eight nuclear families of Hutterites (86 individuals) who belong to a single, 13-generation pedigree. Their relatively high consanguinity allows us to estimate mutation rates both in transmissions from parents to children and in autozygous segments descended from an older common ancestor. By relying on three-generation families with 3?6 children each, instead of the standard trio design, we can assign mutations to male or female germlines, verify transmission of putative mutations, and estimate rates of germline mosaicism. To these ends, we will also resequence a subset of mutations at deep coverage. In Aim 2, we will obtain the first direct estimate of mutation rates in an OWM species. Specifically, we will generate and analyze high- quality genome sequences for seven three-generation families of vervet monkeys (43 individuals, for which ages are known). These individuals belong to a colony of 2,000+ in an 11-generation pedigree, so the data are very similar in structure to that of the Hutterites, and will be analyzed by the same approaches, providing a well-matched comparison to humans. In Aim 3, we will examine the evolution of mutation rates across apes and OWMs. We will generate high-quality genome sequences for ten overlapping nuclear families of western chimpanzees (54 individuals), five families of rhesus macaques (22), and two families of olive baboons (13), for which parental ages are known. The genomic data will be generated using a uniform approach, and a subset of putative mutations will be resequenced to estimate error rates. This analysis will yield the first direct look at the evolution of mutation rates across a set of closely related species, and allow us to revisit the chronology of primate evolution with a more reliable molecular clock. Thus, this study will elucidate variation in the mutation process within human and among closely related species. As a byproduct, the data will enable primate evolutionary genomics and mapping efforts in primate model organisms."
"9482362","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral mucosal defects are secondary to oncologic resection, traumatic events or congenital craniofacial malformations such as cleft palate. Current repair treatments such as autologous grafts are restricted by donor site morbidity, tissue shortage, and retention of the original characteristics of the donor tissue. AlloDerm, a native acellular dermal matrix, with an intact basement membrane, is currently used as a dermal oral soft tissue graft, however, a second procedure for epithelial grafting is required. Keratinocyte populated acellular dermal substrates in ex vivo produced oral mucosal equivalents have been proposed, however, the low cell number obtained from harvested tissue results in graft failure. The proposed research studies will address the capacity of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) to regenerate the oral mucosa epithelium by mimicking an environment in vitro similar to that seen in the human body. Bone marrow- derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are capable of self-renewal, differentiation into cell phenotypes of mesodermal lineage, and transdifferentiation into other cell lineages including epithelial cells. Their local microenvironment composed of growth factors and extracellular matrix (ECM) is known to play a critical role in controlling the proliferation and differentiation fate of stem cells. Our hypothess is that tissue-specific extracellular matrix provides a native microenvironment that governs the ability of multipotent stem cells seeded on Alloderm to both self-renew and differentiate into functional full-thickness oral mucosa epithelium. The following specific aims will be proposed to test this hypothesis: 1) Determine the capacity of MSCs maintained on tissue-specific microenvironment to differentiate into an epithelial cell lineage and form oral mucosa epithelium in vitro; 2) Demonstrate the capacity of predifferentiated MSCs maintained on AlloDerm for oral mucosa epithelium regeneration in vivo using an athymic nude mouse model. These studies will provide training in stem cell maintenance and differentiation, quantitative gene expression, immunochemistry, flow cytometry, FACS sorting, animal modeling, and cell culture. This study is innovative because human bone marrow-derived MSC capability to transdifferentiate into epithelial cells for engineering oral mucosa epithelium has not been explored. The proposed research is significant because it will facilitate the optimization of in vitro oral mucosa equivalnt models for studies of oral mucosa biology and pathology as well as a model alternative to animals for testing of consumer products. These findings will have an impact by initiating human bone marrow-derived MSC research exploration of the field of craniofacial regenerative medicine and lay the foundation to further study the molecular complexity and dynamics of native and tissue-specific ECM in the regulation of MSC proliferation, survival, and differentiation. A better understanding of these mechanisms will move the field closer to bone marrow-derived MSC based therapeutic application by utilizing bone marrow- derived MSCs as an unlimited source of stem cells and treatment of craniofacial defects. Through these studies, I will acquire state-of-the-art knowledge and skills toward my goal to become an established dentist- scientist."
"9269949","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to validate the role and explore the molecular mechanism of RIP1 kinase as a mediator of inflammatory response in Alzheimer's disease (AD), a devastating neurodegenerative disorder and the leading cause of dementia of the elderly. Chronic brain inflammation, characterized by the presence of an increased number of microglia and elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, is a hallmark of AD. Increased levels of cerebral spinal TNF? were found in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) at risk to develop AD, suggesting that CNS inflammation is an early event during the pathogenesis of AD. The role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of AD was further highlighted by a recent network-based integrative analysis of a large collection of gene expression profiles from patients of late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) which discovered the immune/microglia system, including multiple TLR receptors and TNF?, as the molecular system most strongly associated with the pathophysiology of the LOAD. When activated, microglia may release proinflammatory cytokines to drive the chronic progression of AD by exacerbating A? deposition and neuronal death. Identification of the molecular targets in microglia that can be safely modulated to inhibit their inflammatory response may provide new options for the treatment of AD. However, there is a lack of knowledge about the neuroinflammatory mechanism that can be specifically and effectively modulated.  We have developed a highly specific and potent inhibitor of RIP1 kinase, 7-Cl-O-Nec-1, a small molecule with excellent oral availability and safety profile, and highly CNS permeable. RIP1 kinase, a death- domain containing Ser/Thr kinase, has an established role in mediating multiple downstream signaling pathways downstream of TNFR1. We found that RIP1 kinase also plays an important role in mediating the production of TNF? by microglia induced by A? in vitro and in PSAPP transgenic mice in vivo which can be effectively inhibited by 7-Cl-O-Nec-1. Furthermore, oral administration of 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 led to the reduction of amyloid plaques and improved behavior and memory of B6.Cg-Tg(APPswe, PSEN1dE9) 85Dbo/J mice (PSAPP) mice, a model for AD. Our study suggests that RIP1 kinase is an important target for inhibiting neuroinflammatory response in AD. This proposal is to test this hypothesis and investigate the mechanism by which RIP1 kinase mediates neuroinflammatory responses in microglia. Specific Aim 1: Investigating the role and mechanism by which RIP1 kinase mediates inflammatory response in microglia activated by oligomeric A? by testing the possible involvement of MKK7 and TLR signaling as downstream mediators of RIP1 signaling. Specific Aim 2: Investigating the role and mechanism of p62 in A? mediated RIP1 kinase activation in microglia by testing the hypothesis that oligomerized p62 provides a platform for mediating RIP1 activation. Specific Aim 3: Genetic confirmation of the role of RIP1 kinase in mediating inflammatory response in AD transgenic mice using a RIP1 kinase dead knockin mouse line."
"9210546","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Stroke represents a major cause of death and disability in our elderly veterans. Stroke is also a major risk factor for cognitive decline, most often due to vascular cognitive impairment. Veterans with stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) due to large-artery disease are at highest risk for early recurrence and are, therefore, most often subjected to aggressive interventions. Furthermore, large- artery disease has been recognized as an independent risk factor for cognitive impairment. The ability to predict recurrence and prognosis following stroke is crucial for developing novel prevention and treatment strategies. Current diagnostic criteria for stroke include clinical and imaging data. However, no biomarker is currently available that can reliably predict recurrence and prognosis. Lack of such knowledge limits our ability to prevent future ischemic strokes or cognitive decline.  Coated-platelets are a subset of procoagulant platelets observed after co-activation with collagen and thrombin. Coated-platelet levels are significantly higher in patients with ischemic stroke or TIA compared to unaffected controls. In addition, higher levels, measured after the initial infarct correlate with an increased risk for recurrent stroke. Among stroke patients, those with stroke due to large-artery disease and elevated coated-platelet levels have a rate of early recurrent stroke 6-7 fold higher than those with lower coated-platelet levels. Research efforts focusing on platelet biology have shown that platelet micro-RNA (miRNA) has considerable potential for deciphering mechanisms underlying differences in platelet reactivity through modulation of gene expression and protein translation. In preliminary studies, we have shown increased coated-platelet production in patients with stroke due to large-artery disease compared to patients with stroke due to cardiac causes and we have found that differences in the expression of platelet miRNA species may be linked to coated- platelet production. These findings raise the possibility that coated-platelets will serve as an additional risk stratification tool in stroke, through mechanisms that involve platelet miRNA  expression.  The research hypotheses for the current grant are: 1) Coated-platelet levels in patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease are markers for prognosis and recurrence risk: higher levels indicate increased likelihood of recurrent ischemic stroke while lower levels indicate an increased likelihood of hemorrhagic complications, 2) Elevated coated-platelet levels predict the presence and progression of cognitive impairment in patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease, and 3) Increased coated-platelet production is mediated through individual micro-RNAs in stroke patients.  The objective of the current application is to determine the relationship of coated-platelets to stroke due to large-artery disease. Three specific aims will test these hypotheses: 1) Determine the relationship between coated-platelets levels and prognosis in patients with stroke/TIA due to large- artery disease, 2) Test the hypothesis that elevated coated-platelets are predictive of cognitive impairment in stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease, and 3) Identify micro-RNA (miRNA) species associated with coated-platelet production. We plan to test our hypotheses in a large group of patients with stroke/TIA due to large-artery disease (N=430).  The rationale for the proposed research is that once we understand the relationship between coated-platelets and cerebrovascular disease we will be able to improve health care delivery for our veterans with stroke through individualized risk assessment strategies and to identify potential targets for novel pharmacological interventions that involve miRNA-mediated platelet reactivity."
"9272345","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Old age is by far the greatest risk factor for the majority of neurodegenerative diseases, yet few attempts have been made to identify aging-associated therapeutic targets for any of these diseases, including Alzheimer's dementia (AD). During the last ten years the Salk laboratories have developed nerve cell culture drug screening assays that are based upon old-age-associated CNS pathologies, including the loss of trophic support, reduced energy metabolism, oxidative damage, and the accumulation of intracellular aggregated proteins. Using these assays in conjunction with iterative medicinal chemistry, an exceptionally potent compound, called J147, was made that is neuroprotective in all of the above assays with EC50s in the low nanomolar range. This compound also enhances memory in young and very old (30 mo) mice, improves cognitive function and synaptic structure in old (23 mo) AD transgenic mice, and extends the life span of flies. SinceJ147 prevents cell death in multiple cell culture models that lack any of the recognized AD drug targets of the amyloid pathway, it must be acting on highly relevant molecular target(s) and target pathways that are unrelated to the amyloid pathway and that contribute to its therapeutic efficacy. Given that J147 is neuroprotective in multiple, functionally distinct, age-associated toxicity assays, it should be  possible to define common, shared neuroprotective pathway(s) which will then be used as the basis for identifying new therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD. This proposed chemical biology approach to identify drug targets originated in 1785 with the isolation of digoxin from foxglove, followed by morphine from poppies in 1806, and aspirin from salicylic acid in 1897. Not only did these molecules make tremendous contributions to medicine, they also were the key factors in the ++ identification of the molecular pathways and drug targets involving the Na -K -ATP pump, opiate receptors, and the cyclooxygenase enzymes, respectively, leading to a succession of derivative drugs that are in the clinic today. The overall goal of this application i to use a chemical biology approach based upon the J147 compound to identify and validate novel, old-age-associated targets for AD treatment and prevention. This will be done by using molecular biology and proteomics to define the shared molecular signaling pathways that lead to neuroprotection in multiple toxicity assays, and chemistry and proteomics to isolate the molecular target(s) of J147. In vivo target validation will be done in part in an animal model that  is not biased toward the familial AD/amyloid pathway, but rather reflects most aspects of human aging and AD, the senescence-accelerated SAMP8 mice."
"9302002","Project Summary Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the biggest killer in the western world and is the cause of death for nearly 500,000 Americans each year. The symptoms of MI can be vague and non- specific and 7 million adults present to hospital Emergency Departments in the US each year with suspected MI. Advances in cardiac biomarkers have had a large impact on the diagnosis, risk stratification and management of suspected MI patients and rapid and sensitive testing of cardiac biomarkers, specifically troponin, has become the cornerstone for diagnostic workup and care of suspected MI patients. Rapid troponin testing can decrease time to appropriate treatment for MI patients and allow for faster MI rule-out, which will help decrease the billions expended annually for the care of non-MI patients in coronary care units. Yet, despite the clear need for sensitive and rapid cardiac troponin measurements to quickly diagnose and manage patients, there is no POC system that can match the analytical performance of contemporary sensitive laboratory systems. This project is intended to develop and commercialize a fully integrated POC immunoassay platform, based on a CMOS microchip, that is as easy to use as an over the counter pregnancy test and as accurate as high sensitivity laboratory tests. In addition to troponin, which is critically important, the system will be able to measure a myriad of other biomarkers for heart failure, pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis, sepsis and other conditions where speed, convenience and in the field measurement of biomarkers is important."

PhenX measures have become integral to other resources such as Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC), and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Common Data Element (CDE) Resource Portal. PhenX measures are being incorporated in several major studies and are being used in consortiums including the Precision Medicine Initiative, which plans to enroll 1 million or more volunteers; the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study, which is the largest long-term study of brain development and child health ever launched in the United States; and the Tobacco Centers of Regulatory Science. The proposed 5-year research plan ?Genomic Resource Grant for PhenX Toolkit ? expansion and sustainability? focuses on limited expansion of the Toolkit and on providing users with new tools for comparing measures and connecting studies. We will continue collaborations that facilitate interactions between the Toolkit and resources such as dbGaP, REDCap, and the NLM CDE Resource Portal and LOINC. We will also develop educational modules and resources that will help existing users with the new tools and introduce the PhenX Toolkit to the next generation of researchers. The PhenX multidisciplinary team will ensure that the PhenX Toolkit continues to meet the needs of the scientific community through the following Specific Aims. Overall Specific Aim 1: Expand PhenX Toolkit research domains: Address the evolving needs of Toolkit users and the National Institutes of Health by adding PhenX measures related to cancer, environmental exposures, pediatrics, and mental health. Overall Specific Aim 2: Maintain and extend existing collaborations: Raise awareness of complementary efforts and facilitate navigation between the Toolkit and resources such as dbGaP, REDCap, the NLM CDE Resource Portal, and LOINC. Overall Specific Aim 3: Raise awareness and increase impact: Toolkit users and the studies they lead will benefit from increased uptake of PhenX measures. We propose a multifaceted educational component to raise awareness and increase use of PhenX measures and tools. In summary, we will increase the breadth and depth of the Toolkit to support the evolving needs of the scientific community, extend successful collaborations to further integrate PhenX with existing resources, and take advantage of educational environments to promote use and introduce the next generation of scientists to the PhenX Toolkit."
"9276554","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The last period of T32 funding was accompanied by growth in the presence of aging research with the installation of 2 new Centers within the institute for Aging research and its ~50 investigators. The Nathan Shock Center of Excellence in the Basic Biology of Aging (NIA) has Cores and pilot and feasibility grants and the Glenn Center for the Biology of Human Aging provides pilot and feasibility studies to move into human genome, tissues and drug research. Together with 3 aging-related program projects (P01) in genetics and the biology of aging, R01s, K awards funding from AFAR and the Ellison Medical Foundation, and a graduate course in Biology of Aging, we have capabilities for great exposure to aging research when training graduates and post-doctoral fellows. This last period of T32 funding has been a success judging by the quality of candidates, their scientific and academic achievement, the number of trainees who are now successful faculty members, the number of MDs trained and the number of minority individuals trained. Because we do not wish to reject or defer excellent candidates, we ask for one additional slot for pre-doctoral trainees and one for postdoctoral trainees for our program. For this competitive renewal application for this Training Grant, we propose new approaches and changes to our training: 1) Our focus is on the 3 'legs' of modern aging research with all investigators funded at least in part for aging research: Aging-Genomics (Jan Vijg, group leader); Aging-Metabolism (Nir Barzilai, group leader); and Cellular-Aging (Ana Maria Cuervo group leader); 2) We have a cadre of young funded investigators who will become mentors alongside an experienced co-mentor. Thus we do not limit this opportunity only to senior mentors with a more extensive track record and make ensure quality training. 2) We will encourage participation in P01 projects where the group exposure is more intense and projects tend to have translational aspects. 3) Based on our success during the last funding period, we will continue to seek MDs who are ready to transit to academic life in genetics or biology of aging. 4) All of our trainees commit to take the 30 hour, highly ranked, graduate course on the biology of aging. 5) Numerous seminars, retreats and symposiums are available for trainees to present their work and interact on an Institutional level. Thus, our training program has been very strong and is getting stronger due to the uniqueness of our Institute and its resources, allowing participants to gain state-of-the-art research training, enabling them to embark on careers involving research in aging and aging-related diseases."
"9278104","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a major public health challenge and a growing problem for the Veteran's Affairs (VA) Health System and the Department of Defense (DoD)[1]. While effective treatments for PTSD such as Prolonged Exposure (PE) have been developed [4], a significant number of patients remain symptomatic or are unable to utilize these treatments to their full potential [4, 5]. Thus, optimization of these treatments is essential. Optimizing PE is ot simple, and isolating specific components and then empirically testing them requires multiple studies, large numbers of subjects and thus, is prohibitively expensive. Alternatively, integrating affective neuroscience methods, such as identifying specific potential biomarkers of treatment change can make each study more informative, effective, and less expensive. Neurobiological studies of PTSD have linked specific candidate biomarkers [endogenous glucocorticoids and neurosteroids, i.e. cortisol, allopregnanolone (ALLO) and metabolites, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA/DHEAS)] to PTSD severity and potentially to treatment response. Identifying the mechanisms involved in treatment response can assist in improving therapeutic techniques by targeting specific neurobiological processes involved. Identifying the mechanisms involved in treatment response can assist in improving therapeutic techniques by targeting specific neurobiological processes involved. For instance, identified biomarkers may be used to guide augmentation prior to PE or may lead to directing certain patients to alternate PTSD treatment To this end, we propose an add-on study for an ongoing STRONG STAR affiliated PTSD treatment trial comparing Prolonged Exposure-Web (PE-Web) and Present Centered Therapy (PCT). In our add-on study, we will examine the role of specific candidate biomarkers (endogenous glucocorticoids and neurosteroids, i.e. cortisol awakening response, cortisol response to specific challenge, ALLO and metabolites, and DHEA/DHEAS) collected at Baseline, week 4, Week 8 (post), and one month follow-up as: a) predictors of treatment response, and b) indices of therapeutic change during PTSD treatment. We aim to: 1) identify specific changes in neuroendocrine and neurosteroid patterns that track PTSD symptom changes following effective treatment, 2) examine the specificity of PE-induced neuroendocrine and neurosteroid changes by directly comparing patterns across PE-Web and PCT, and 3) examine whether treatment response related changes in these peripheral biomarkers are directly associated with treatment changes. We expect that increased cortisol responsivity and increases in neurosteroid levels between Baseline and week 8 will be associated with PTSD symptom reduction. Establishing the link between treatment responses and specific biomarkers will allow: mechanism-informed selection of effective treatment (optimizing PE effectiveness), more feasible and effective treatment response studies (increasing efficiency), as well as better individualized treatment tailoring (personalized medicine)."
"9275400","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Liver fibrosis is the result of chronic liver damage from various etiologies including alcohol abuse, obesity, or viral hepatitis. Chronic liver disease may progress to cirrhosis, an end stage disease and major cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States and in particular among Veterans. Patients with chronic liver disease show intestinal bacterial overgrowth and dysbiosis. They also demonstrate increased intestinal permeability, and disease severity correlates with systemic levels of bacterial products. Although experimental liver fibrosis is dependent on gut derived bacterial products, yet the exact contribution of the commensal microflora to liver fibrosis is unknown. Since the interaction of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) with the innate immune system can also confer protection to the host, we subjected germfree mice to experimental models of liver fibrosis. Results from our laboratory demonstrate that germfree mice show exacerbated liver fibrosis as compared with conventional mice. Livers of germfree mice have a decreased expression of the antioxidant heat shock protein (Hsp)-25, more oxidative stress and a higher rate of apoptosis. The focus of this application is to further characterize the relationship between the intestinal microflora and the progression of chronic liver disease. We hypothesize that the commensal microflora is an important suppressor of oxidative stress and hence fibrosis upon chronic liver injury in mice. Our experimental approach is to apply mouse models of toxin-induced and cholestatic liver fibrosis to germfree and conventional mice and to investigate the contribution of the bacterial microflora to chronic liver disease (Aim 1). We will then assess the mechanism by which the microflora ameliorates experimental liver fibrosis. The focus will be on Hsp25 that is lower expressed in hepatocytes of germfree mice as compared with conventional mice and that has antioxidant properties. We will test the new concept that bacterial products or metabolites induce Hsp25 in hepatocytes. We will also focus on hepatic stellate cells to explain the phenotype with increased fibrosis under germ-free conditions (Aim 2). We will then supplement germfree mice with one bacterial metabolite or colonize germ-free mice with indole-3-propionic acid (IPA) synthesizing bacteria, and subject them to experimental liver fibrosis. A preventive and therapeutic approach will be chosen. Bacterial products or metabolites might confer antioxidant properties directly or via the induction of antioxidant molecules to the liver (Aim 3). We believe these studies will provide important insights into the contribution of the commensal microflora to liver fibrosis. This will establish a novel shift in the current paradigm that all translocated bacteria and their products are bad for liver injury and chronic liver disease. Eventually this approach might lead to new therapeutic targets and therapies for patients with chronic liver disease."
"9352668","PROJECT SUMMARY Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) constitute a recently identified cell population that produces type 2 cytokines such as IL-5 and IL-13 in response to a growing number of environmental signals and epithelial cell-derived cytokines. Initially described as a key source of IL-13 in anti-helminth innate immunity, studies now show increased ILC2 activity in asthma and many widespread allergic diseases. In murine models of asthma, ILC2s are sufficient to provoke eosinophilic inflammation accompanied by airway hyperreactivity (AHR) independent of adaptive immunity. Based on these findings, identifying agents capable of modulating ILC2 function is an important step towards advancing treatment of asthma. This project is motivated by our recent finding that sodium butyrate, a short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) naturally present in our body?s tissues and fluids, significantly suppresses the production of type 2 cytokines by ILC2s and relieves ILC2-dependent AHR. We additionally found that pulmonary ILC2s highly express a receptor for sodium butyrate, GPR109a and do not express GPR41 or GPR43. Further transcriptome analyses revealed that GATA-3, a key transcription factor in ILC2 development and function, was significantly down-regulated after treatment with sodium butyrate. Given that intestinal bacteria are the predominant source of butyrate in mammals, we now propose to characterize the mechanisms by which microbial-derived sodium butyrate potentially modulates ILC2 effector function in distal tissues and reduces ILC2-dependent AHR. The overall goal of this research project is to discover a comprehensive set of molecular signatures and markers that can be used as therapeutic targets to treat allergic disease and asthma. In order to achieve this objective, we will first fully characterize the phenotype, function, and mechanisms of action of sodium butyrate in animal models of AHR. Next, utilizing a recently described ILC2 humanized mice (Maazi et al, Immunity 2015, Galle et al, Nature Communications 2016), we intend to assess the capacity for therapeutic intervention in the presence of absence of GPR109a receptor. Finally, we will aim to prevent development of ILC2 dependent AHR via altering microbiome of mice with high butyrate producing strains of bacteria and compare the results to the recipients of microbiome without capacity to produce butyrate. This translational research proposal will provide critical clues that enable us to develop therapeutic approaches for the treatment of patients with allergic disease and asthma."
"9405331","DESCRIPTION  (provided by applicant)    Dr. Bilgen is a current CDA-1 recipient (2008) and has a strong bioengineering background with hands-on research experience over 10 years in cartilage tissue engineering.  Dr. Bilgen's research interests include bioengineering applications to clinical problems in orthopaedics, specifically skeletal biology, repair and regeneration.  This application aims to develop a transplantable biocomposite to restore cartilage of a traumatized joint. Limb trauma in young veterans often results in loss of cartilage tissue function that leads to severe arthritis and osteoarthritis.  Total national cost of arthritis was $81 billion in medical costs and $47 billion in lost wages in 2003.  US veterans face increased risks of arthritis compared with non-veterans due to orthopedic injuries at the military. Implantation of engineered cartilage that is produced by the patient's autologous chondrocytes is not fully successful in healing cartilage defects.  This project addresses two main problems in cartilage tissue engineering: 1) limited availability of adult autologous chondrocytes and limited differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), 2) insufficient mechanical properties of engineered cartilage.  Due to limited chondrocyte availability, adult mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are widely used to produce cartilage tissue, but they do not secrete cartilage matrix at the same rate as chondrocytes.  We and others have shown that co-culturing adult stem cells with chondrocytes improve the biochemical composition of engineered cartilage.  Application of intermittent mechanical loading such as compression or shear during tissue cultivation has been shown to improve cartilage formation, however the optimum dose differs with cell and tissue properties.  The central hypothesis is that the combination of co-culturing chondrocytes and MSC and application of biaxial mechanical loading will synergistically enhance deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM) and improve the functional properties of cartilage tissue after transplantation. Over the five-year CDA-2 program, Dr. Bilgen aims to achieve three research goals: 1- Develop a co-culture system to address the limited availability of chondrocytes: The approach is to optimize ECM deposition using a combination of chondrocytes and synovial MSC and growth factors. The expected outcome is a novel cell sourcing methodology that utilizes co-cultures of chondrocytes and synovial MSC. 2- Create a cartilage biocomposite with improved mechanical properties: We designed a novel biaxial loading device, which was shown to be compatible with the development of tissue-engineered cartilage biocomposites in long term in vitro studies. The approach is to investigate the effects of uniaxial and biaxial mechanical loading in vitro on the differentiation of cells and the mechanical properties of engineered tissue. The expected outcome is the development of a novel biaxial loading system to create a biocomposite that can successfully repair and restore function to cartilage. 3- Develop an in vivo-compatible biocomposite for cartilage repair: The approach will be to cultivate the biocomposite in vitro to improve functional properties followed by implantation in vivo in a chondral defect in a minipig model. The expected outcome is the development of a biocomposite that can successfully repair cartilage in vivo. The innovation in this grant proposal lies in the synergistic application of instructive co- culturing and a novel mechanical loading scheme on a cartilage tissue engineering system using mesenchymal stem cells. The broader impact is that the developed techniques are anticipated to treat degenerative joint diseases and prevent joint replacement surgeries, thus impacting nearly half of the population."
"9325394","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Cognitive decline continues to be one of greatest health threats affecting the elderly. In fact, aging remains the single most dominant risk factor for dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease. When considering, the rate at which the human population is aging, it becomes imperative to identify means by which to maintain cognitive integrity by protecting against, or even counteracting, the effects of aging. Presupposed dogma holds that the old brain is unable to combat the effects of aging due to a lack of inherent plasticity that facilitates permanent age-related functional impairments. We, and others, have begun to challenge such dogma by showing that systemic manipulations such as heterochronic parabiosis (in which the circulatory systems of young and old animals are connected) can enhance adult stem cell function in the aged brain. Moreover, my lab recently demonstrated that neuronal and cognitive rejuvenation is possible in the aged brain by systemic administration of young blood plasma, and identified the transcription factor Creb as a critical mediator of brain rejuvenation. While the burgeoning field of rejuvenation research is fast growing, the current focus thus far has been placed on identifying individual blood-borne factors in young blood. However, this approach has left fundamental questions unexplored: 1. How long lasting are the rejuvenating effects of young blood on the old brain? 2. What mechanistic changes does young blood elicit in the old brain to promote rejuvenation? 3. Do the beneficial effects of young blood on the aged brain extend to dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease? The purpose of the proposed study is thus to investigate the rejuvenating and therapeutic effects of young blood on the aged brain. Specifically, our hypothesis is that systemic exposure to young blood elicits long lasting rejuvenation of synaptic and cognitive functions, while ameliorating neurodegenerative phenotypes. We will test this theory with three Specific Aims: 1. Characterize the kinetics of brain rejuvenation following systemic exposure to young blood. 2. Identify molecular mechanisms downstream of Creb underlying brain rejuvenation by young blood. 3. Distinguish rejuvenating versus therapeutic effects of young blood in a model of accelerated aging and Alzheimer's disease. Ultimately, these studies will challenge traditional views of brain aging by using the rejuvenating effects of young blood to obtain a mechanistic understanding of the cellular events required for unleashing the latent plasticity within the old brain. The results will also have significant translational potential, revealing pathways that could be targeted for novel therapies to ameliorate dementia-related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease."

"9266512","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A significant percentage of people in the US suffer from behavioral disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety disorders, and drug addiction, that are effectively diseases of memory dysfunction. Therefore, an understanding of the cell biology of learning and memory should facilitate the development of treatments for these disorders.  One of the fundamental forms of associative learning is classical conditioning. During classical conditioning an animal learns to associate a neutral stimulus (the conditioned stimulus) with the delivery of a reinforcing stimulus (unconditioned stimulus). This project will exploit the significant experimental advantages of the marine mollusk Aplysia californica to develop a mechanistic understanding of classical conditioning. This animal has a simple nervous system that is highly suited to electrophysiological, pharmacological, and molecular experimental techniques. The project will focus on a classical conditioning of the defensive withdrawal reflex in Aplysia. This form of learning is mediated by a combination of homosynaptic, NMDA receptor-dependent plasticity and heterosynaptic, serotonergic neuromodulation. The PI hypothesizes that the postsynaptic motor neuron is a major cite of associative interaction between these two processes. The project will investigate the potential postsynaptic interactions between Hebbian and neuromodulatory processes. Toward this end, the PI will perform imaging of calcium in the motor neuron to determine whether intracellular calcium resulting from postsynaptic NMDA receptor activity and calcium released from postsynaptic intracellular stores by serotonin stimulation interact. In addition, the potential rol of postsynaptic calcium- calmodulin kinase II and postsynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors will be examined. The PI will also investigate the role of modulation of postsynaptic AMPA receptor trafficking in classical conditioning by expressing constructs in Aplysia motor neurons that block AMPA receptor trafficking. The proposed studies will use both sensorimotor cocultures and reduced preparations of Aplysia."
"9268538","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): One of the major gaps in our understanding of the evolution of Alzheimer's disease is how the deposition of amyloid triggers tauopathy. Moreover, it is now widely recognized that it is common for the CNS of individuals with a neurodegenerative phenotype to develop multiple pathologic abnormalities. The basis for the preponderance of mixed pathology is poorly understood. We hypothesize that insults that compromised function of the proteostasis network may lay the foundation for the development of mixed proteinopathies. The basic concept here is that high levels of misfolded proteins produce an added burden on the proteostatic network by occupying various activities required to dissociate such aggregates and degrade the misfolded proteins. This concept was first uncovered in C. elegans models, where the expression of proteins that produce intracellular inclusions leads to the secondary misfolding of by-stander proteins that are particularly dependent upon the proteostatic network. Recently, we have extended this concept to mammalian model systems. In proteomic studies of brain from mice with high levels of Alzheimer-amyloidosis, Drs. Xu and Borchelt identified a number of cytosolic proteins that appeared to lose solubility - a finding that is consistent with the hypothesis that amyloid deposition can, by some manner, impinge on the function of the proteostatic network to cause secondary misfolding. The Lewis laboratory also recently found that two independent lines of mice that model tau pathology also develop cytoplasmic TDP-43 immunoreactive inclusion pathology. Thus, in our mouse models, we are beginning to uncover evidence that the accumulation of one misfolded protein, can by some manner, impact on the folding of others. Our central hypothesis is that these secondary pathologies are the consequence, at least in part, of a disturbance in the cellular protein quality control network, or proteostasis network, to cause collateral misfolding. In the present application, we propose 3 Aims that seek to determine the contribution of proteostatic network dysfunction to the evolution of AD-related pathology. Aim 1 will create a novel paradigm in which mutant tau expression is induced in a preexisting environment of amyloid pathology and disturbed proteostatic function. Aim 2 will determine how the mixed pathology of AD may synergize to produce by-stander misfolding and whether the severity of such misfolding produces functional deficits in critical cellular processes (e.g. energy metabolism). Aim 3 will determine whether augmentation of proteostatic networks mitigates by-stander misfolding. Collectively, these studies will provide new insight into how AD-related pathology impacts CNS protein homoeostasis and whether augmentation of the network in later stages of disease may provide significant benefit."
"9410815","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental exposures during critical periods of development can permanently reprogram normal physiological responses to increase susceptibility to disease later in life, a process termed developmental reprogramming. The Principal Investigator and Co-Principal Investigator of this U01 application are among the leaders identifying epigenetic targets for developmental reprogramming. However, studies in the field have focused on the target tissues for reprogramming events, and virtually nothing is known about whether similar and/or correlative epigenetic changes occur in surrogate tissues. This presents a Central Challenge for the field to move from experimental studies on target tissues and exposure-associated pathologies in murine models, to making connections between exposure-induced epigenetic changes in surrogate tissues and health outcomes in human populations. To address this Central Challenge, we have assembled an outstanding team of investigators, comprised of leaders in fields critical for success of the TaRGET II Consortium (T2C): Developmental reprogramming (Walker and Bartolomei), Epigenetics and Bioinformatics (Huang, Sun and Wang) and mouse models of genetic diversity (Threadgill). In Aim 1, we will generate reference epigenomic maps to identify epigenetic alterations induced in target and surrogate tissues by developmental reprogramming in response to specific environmental exposures, focusing on histone modifications and DNA methylation. Since surrogate tissue biomarkers may be accessed and/or interrogated at different times during an individual's lifetime, in Aim 2, we will track specific epigenetic alterations induced in target and surrogate tissues across the life course. In Aim 3 we will test the hypothesis that genetic heterogeneity modulates reprogramming events and/or the appearance and persistence of epigenetic alterations in target and surrogate tissues using genetically diverse mice from the Collaborative Cross. Together, these studies will identify those epigenetic marks that are the most robust against genetic background and most likely to be stable biomarkers of exposure and/or phenotypic consequence across the life course and genetically diverse populations."
"9276253","RESEARCH CENTER SUMMARY The overall objectives of this BETRNet Research Center (RC) are: 1) to conduct a rigorous, integrated spectrum of transdisciplinary human research in Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) 2) to increase the biological understanding of key observations made by our clinical researchers; 3) to translate knowledge derived from genetic, epigenetic, and transcriptome research to solving clinical dilemmas in detection, prognosis, prevention, and therapy of BE in order to prevent EAC and improve the outcomes of EAC; 4) to foster a transdisciplinary and translational research culture and to effectively expand and enhance scientific research focused on BE and EAC; 5) to evaluate research and transdisciplinary programs and to continuously improve research, productivity and enhance translational implementation. These objectives build and synergize on existing multi-institutional collaborative networks and the considerable clinical, basic science, and translational expertise available at our institutions, focusing on improving the outcomes of patients with BE and EAC. The overarching organization framework for this RC proposal is 1) to focus laboratory research on understanding the genetic susceptibility, genomic and epigenetic changes that influence the development of BE and EAC; and 2) to then translate laboratory discoveries into clinical applications for effective detection, molecular risk stratification, and prevention of progression from BE to EAC."
"9268548","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The polymorphism of amyloid fibrils is well-established, but little is known how these various structures relate to disease pathogenesis. Our overall goal is to understand possible structure-malfunction relationships, i.e., relationship between the Aß aggregate structure and disease phenotype. This proposal is based on our previous work on Alzheimer's Disease (AD) brain-seeded fibrils (two papers, in PNAS (1), and in Cell (2)), the main findings of which were: 1) Brain Aß fibrils can be examined using amyloid from AD patients to seed isotopically labeled Aß solutions, thus producing replicate fibrils for solid-state NMR. 2) We obtained unprecedented structural detail, comparable to crystallography in resolution, of an AD brain- seeded Aß fibril. 3) Aß fibrils seeded from AD brain amyloid hav unique structures, which are providing startling new insights into AD pathogenesis. Remarkably (given the usual polymorphism of amyloid fibrils (4)), three different brain regions (from each of two individual patients) each yielded seeded fibrils with only one structure, i.e., identical in al three anatomic sites. But the fibrils from one patient were clearly of different structure from those of a second patient. As described in the proposal, our results raise a host of questions, including the possibility that during the development of AD, aggregated material might spread throughout the brain, seeding fibril formation in different regions. In the proposed studies, we wil examine replicate fibrils made by seeding with Alzheimer Disease (human and mouse model) brain amyloid. There are two specific aims: Aim 1) To study the structure of brain-seeded amyloid fibrils from patients with classical AD and clinically atypical forms of AD, including Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA). (Further sub-aims are described in the proposal.) We will use brain amyloid from patients with AD and its variants to produce replicate Aß fibrils for study by solid- state NMR and other methods. Aim 2): A) To compare the structure of brain-seeded amyloid fibrils from AD patients to those from mice with five select models of cerebral amyloidosis/AD. These mice have cerebral amyloidosis, but have a range of neurological deficits. B) To compare human AD brain-seeded Aß40 fibrils to: human AD brain-seeded Aß42 fibrils, and Aß40 fibrils seeded by synthetic Aß42 fibrils. Through these studies, we will obtan critical information on the range of fibrils occurring in patients and mouse models of AD, and probe the possibility of a relationship between aggregate type and symptomatology, which will go beyond straightforward assessments of quantity of Aß deposits. These studies also have important implications for individualizing therapies and early diagnostic procedures (see 3)."
"9332028","Abstract The focus of this proposal is to host a triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)-focused scientific conference entitled ?1st International TNBC Conference: Illuminating Actionable Biology in TNBC? to a diverse, international audience on Sept. 25-26, 2017, in Atlanta, GA. The broad, long-term objective of the proposed conference is to help realize the promises of precision medicine for TNBC patients, for whom there are still no approved targeted drugs or prognostic assays. As a result, a diagnosis of TNBC confers a bleak prognosis that contrasts starkly with that of non-TNBC patients, for whom advances in precision medicine have revolutionized clinical care. In addition, African American (AA) breast cancer patients have an increased risk of poor clinical outcomes, such as metastasis and death, compared with European American (EA) patients, because: (a) AA women have a 2-3-fold greater likelihood of developing TNBC and (b) even among TNBC patients, AAs experience a more aggressive disease course than EAs. Thus, the biology of TNBC differs fundamentally between AAs and EAs, leading to a glaring racial disparity in breast cancer outcomes. Progress in TNBC research has thus stagnated because of the overwhelming complexity, inter-patient and intratumor heterogeneity of this disease. To deconvolve this complexity, it is necessary for a diversity of TNBC investigators across the globe, with their unique perspectives, distinct areas of expertise, and complementary resources, to join together to identify and validate actionable TNBC biology, which if exploited, can transform clinical care for TNBC patients. However, at present, there are limited opportunities for TNBC investigators to meet one another because TNBC-focused conferences are exceedingly rare. Thus, there is an urgent unmet need for an international scientific conference exclusively dedicated to TNBC research, which we propose to fill through three specific aims: Aim 1: To present the latest research on actionable biology in TNBC from leaders in the field to a diverse, international audience. Talks will be given on topics related to actionable biology in TNBC (biology of TNBC, big data analysis, health disparities, prognostic/predictive biomarkers, novel drug targets, and treatment strategies), with the keynote address delivered by Prof. Ian Ellis of the University of Nottingham. Registration will be capped at 250. Travel awards and waived registration will be provided to meritorious applicants from groups underrepresented in the life sciences, and measures will be taken to assist attendees with childcare needs. Aim 2: To provide a forum for labs across the world to present their latest research findings on TNBC in a poster session. Up to 50 abstracts will be accepted and presentations will be judged by an esteemed panel of researchers. Aim 3: To host an engaging, innovative and participant-led ?Talk It and Chalk It? brainstorming session to generate new research ideas. The impact of successful completion of these aims will be to disseminate cutting-edge research findings about actionable biology in TNBC to diverse researchers from around the world and to stimulate collaborative TNBC research that can advance precision medicine for the TNBC patients."
"9329860","PROJECT SUMMARY  Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading contributor to racial disparities in life expectancy and uncontrolled hypertension is a critical risk factor underlying this disparity. Despite interventions to overcome barriers to hypertension control, accumulating evidence demonstrates that well-meaning, egalitarian providers can harbor implicit biases that affect patient interactions, clinical decision-making, and the effectiveness of interventions to mitigate cross-cultural differences. We propose a program called COmmuNity-engaged SimULation Training for Blood Pressure Control (CONSULT-BP), a theory-based, multi-component, training intervention that targets medical residents and nurse practitioner students. CONSULT-BP will adapt and test a theory-based, `awareness, exposure and skill-building' intervention, applied in the safety of a simulation-based learning center, to improve providers' interaction skills with minority and poor patients. We will use our established platform of community-based participatory research to implement CONSULT-BP in an academic medical center with a large, safety-net health system that serves a minority and poor population. The CONSULT-BP project will: 1. recruit and hire Community Advisors (CA) representing diverse underserved populations who will participate in the adaptation of evidence-based hypertension communication tools and the design, development, and implementation of the training curriculum; 2. use online self-assessments of clinicians' implicit bias for race and patient compliance to raise bias self-awareness and to examine the effect of bias on knowledge and skill development; and 3. hire Community SPs to (a) conduct face-to-face, simulated clinical encounters with medical trainees and NP students, and (b) provide evaluation and feedback about communication skills along with trained CA observers and faculty facilitators. The educational intervention is a program of two, 90-minute, sessions, spaced 5 weeks apart that combine online learning with in-person skill practice. To understand how much training exposure is required to `move the needle' of clinical skills and patient outcomes, we will assess the effect of CONSULT-BP by conducting two, sequential, randomized trials. Trial 1 will evaluate the effectiveness of one-time CONSULT training on outcomes, and Trial 2 will evaluate the effect of repeat, booster training on outcomes. To support training feasibility in Trial 1, CONSULT-BP will train cohorts of IM, FM, and NP trainees over a 3-year period, and will target advanced (2nd or 3rd-year) trainees within a given academic year for one-time exposure to the training intervention. Within each academic year, we will randomize training times to 1 of 5 start dates using a stepped wedge design to accommodate pre-existing training schedules and to mitigate the effect of temporal trends in clinical skill proficiency. Trial 2 will randomly assign continuing trainee participants from Trial 1 to a second CONSULT-BP booster training exposure versus no booster training. The primary outcome for both trials will be patient BP control. Secondary process outcomes will include trainees' communication skills and patient adherence to medications, visits, and diet changes. We will also examine effect modification by patient characteristics (baseline BP control) and trainee characteristics (implicit bias and awareness of bias). Trainee measures will be from trainee self-report (implicit bias, bias awareness), community SP report (trainee communication skills), and clinic patient surveys (trainee communication quality and patient adherence). Clinical BP outcomes will be from the EMR. We will use analytic mixed effect models accounting for patient and clinician characteristics, patient correlations within randomization clusters and within clinicians, and repeated measures within patient. The CONSULT-BP multi-staged, community-engaged, education model will change how medical educators think about helping providers develop bias-aware, patient-centered, communication skills."
"9228433","PROJECT SUMMARY Family psychoeducation for adults with psychotic disorders in Tanzania Global health officials have called for treatment of psychotic disorders to be prioritized in low- and middle- income countries where they have been severely neglected. A major obstacle to care for those living with psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia globally is an absence of evidence-based practices appropriate for cultural contexts where resources are scarce, families are fundamental for treatment, and where many affected individuals and their families hold traditional (i.e. non-biomedical) ideas about the cause of psychosis and seek treatment from traditional practitioners. Family psychoeducation (FPE) is an evidence-based practice used in high-income countries to help individuals with psychotic disorders and their relatives to cope more effectively with the illness; however, FPE has never been tested in a low-resource country nor have the mechanisms of action for this psychosocial intervention been fully identified in any context. This project posits that FPE has great potential for improving the reach, quality, and effectiveness of mental health services for those with psychotic disorders in Tanzania and other similar contexts worldwide?namely, by using family members as co-facilitators for the intervention and by explicitly addressing the traditional beliefs and practices of affected individuals and their caregivers. The goal of this R34 proposal (RFA-MH-16-410) is to pilot test a tailored Family Psychoeducation model (FamPE) for adults with psychotic disorders and their relatives that is appropriate for cultural settings inclusive of both traditional and biomedical ideas about mental illness and that incorporates relatives as co-facilitators of the intervention. We will utilize formative research [70 qualitative interviews], an expert review panel, and a small randomized controlled trial (RCT) [72 patient/relative dyads] to meet these specific aims: 1) Assess how family psychoeducation can improve client outcomes, engage families and address gaps in mental health services in Tanzania from various stakeholder perspectives; 2) Develop the FamPE intervention for use in Tanzania by building upon and tailoring the SAMHSA Family Psychoeducation Evidence-Based Practice Kit; 3) Elucidate the mechanisms of action and refine the mediation and study outcome measures for the future R01; and 4) Pilot test the FamPE intervention to a) assess the feasibility and acceptability of an adapted FPE intervention for 12 weeks, and b) explore its impact on patient relapse, quality of life and disability. This pilot effectiveness trial of FamPE will adequately prepare us for a subsequent R01 submission for a fully powered RCT of FamPE against the standard of care in Tanzania. This project supports NIMH's strategic priority of effectiveness research on therapeutic interventions with previously demonstrated efficacy for use with broader target populations and it also supports NIMH's priority for clinical trials to explicitly address whether the intervention engages the hypothesized mechanisms of action."
"9321776","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the aging of the U.S. population there has been a fundamental shift among patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI); the typical patient is now older, with more comorbidities, than even 20 years ago. While there has been significant progress in the development of AMI management strategies such as coronary revascularization procedures and antithrombotic medications, their benefits and harms were studied in trials of younger patients or in older adults without aging-related comorbidities. In practice, the average older adult with AMI is now being managed more aggressively with these therapies, although it remains challenging to precisely characterize and explain potential treatment-related harms such as renal failure after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), stroke after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), and bleeding from dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT). While an accurate assessment of these potential harms is a critical component of AMI shared decision making (SDM) for older adults, an effective means of prediction is lacking. Physiologic age, which is manifested by geriatric impairments in domains such as mobility, strength, and cognition, shows promise as a determinant of post-AMI risk, but most studies have failed to measure it. We propose to address this gap in knowledge by first analyzing data from the SILVER-AMI study, an NIH-funded longitudinal cohort enrolling 3000 participants aged ?75 with AMI (Aim 1), and subsequently performing primary data collection at NYU Langone Medical Center (Aims 2-3). In Aim 1 we will develop a risk score for in-hospital coronary revascularization-related complications that incorporates geriatric impairments. In Sub-Aim 1 we will then explore the association between geriatric impairments and bleeding related to DAPT within 6 months of AMI. In Aim 2 we will use a qualitative methodology to assess decisional needs related to coronary revascularization, and in Aim 3 we will then develop and pilot a web-based decision aid to be used prior to revascularization. Our proposed work is innovative because it builds on a study (SILVER-AMI) that provides a rigorous assessment of geriatric impairments post-AMI and their prognostic importance. We also incorporate patients' perspectives (through a qualitative methodology), and provide patient-specific risk estimates in our decision aid which will allow for more individualized SDM discussions. My overall career goal is to become an independent investigator and thought leader in geriatric cardiology with the ability to perform research that improves care for older adults. To achieve this goal I will use the training period to gain skills n quantitative methods, qualitative research, decision aid development, and clinical trials, and to build leadership capabilities that can influence practice. I have assembled a team of Mentors with expertise in Geriatrics (Dr. Caroline Blaum, Dr. Daniel Matlock) and Cardiovascular Clinical Research (Dr. Sarwat Chaudhry, Dr. Stuart Katz), which is supplemented by experienced Advisors and Collaborators. In parallel with my 75% research effort, I will build a practice as a geriatric cardiologist and therefore perform clinical work directly relevant to my research."
"9310766","PROJECT SUMMARY Cancer related fatigue (CRF) is persistent exhaustion related to cancer and/or its treatment. CRF is the most severe during treatment and can severely interfere with activities of daily living. Pharmacologic agents to treat CRF have been studied but there is insufficient evidence to recommend their use. Non- pharmacological interventions for CRF have also been studied but are costly to implement and involve significant patient burden particularly among those in active treatment. Given the clinical impact of CRF, the goal of this project is to investigate a novel low-cost/low-burden intervention: systematic light exposure (sLE) to treat CRF. Two hundred forty-eight breast cancer (BC) patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy will be recruited from Mount Sinai Medical Center, Roosevelt Hospital, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and randomized to one of two conditions: bright white light (BWL) or dim red light (DRL), a common comparison condition in light studies. The BWL intervention consists of exposure to full spectrum bright light whereas the DRL condition will involve exposure to less intense red light (< 50 lux). Both groups will self-administer 30 minutes of light from identically appearing boxes daily throughout 4 cycles of chemotherapy. Outcomes will be assessed through standardized subjective and objective measures at eight separate time points. The study will specifically address recommendations made for interventions for CRF from the NCI Clinical Trials Planning meeting (JNCI,2013).The proposed study will be the first large multisite randomized control trial (RCT) to: 1) determine if sLE affects CRF among BC patients undergoing adjuvant chemotherapy; 2) investigate whether sLE improves sleep and depressive symptoms and normalizes circadian activity and diurnal cortisol rhythms; 3) explore the possible mediational roles of sleep, circadian activity/cortisol rhythms, and depressive symptoms 4) test and intervention that can be widely and inexpensively disseminated with no harm to patients; and 5) address areas of investigation identified by the NCI as a top priority. This RCT will have major"
"9285678","Project Summary Hip and knee replacements improve function and quality of life for people with severe arthritis, yet there have been long-standing racial disparities in the use and outcomes of these surgeries. Black Americans are about 40-50% less likely to receive hip or knee replacements (also called lower extremity joint replacements, or LEJR) than whites. Even if they receive LEJR, black patients are more likely to have complications leading to readmissions or death. Despite national awareness of this issue, this disparity persists. In April 2016, Medicare implemented the Comprehensive Care for Joint Replacement (CJR) model, a program that may substantially affect racial disparities in LEJR. The CJR, Medicare's first mandatory bundled payment program, represents an ambitious attempt to move away from the predominant fee-for-service system with the potential to serve as a model for future payment systems. Under CJR, hospitals are accountable for the cost of care for 90 days after patients with LEJR are discharged. An innovative component of CJR is that it is being implemented in 67 randomly selected metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs). This design provides a unique opportunity to estimate the causal effect of this payment reform. The CJR program may have a profound effect on racial disparities. CJR does not adjust for patients' socioeconomic status when they set target payment rates. This may lead hospitals to avoid admitting LEJR patients with more complex social service needs during recovery. Since a disproportionately high percentage of those patients may be black, existing disparities in the receipt of LEJR could be exacerbated. On the other hand, once the decision is made to provide LEJR, hospitals and post-acute care providers under CJR face new incentives to work together to improve care coordination for high-needs patients. These changes may reduce racial disparities in post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Our proposed research makes use of the unique randomized design of the CJR program to assess its effects on black-white disparities in LEJR. Our central hypothesis is that CJR increases disparities in the receipt of LEJR, but reduces disparities in the quality of post-acute care following LEJR and patient outcomes of LEJR. Specifically, this proposal aims to assess the effect of the CJR program on black-white disparities 1) in the receipt of LEJR, 2) in post-acute care following LEJR, and 3) in patient outcomes of LEJR. To assess the effects of the CJR program, we will use Medicare claims to conduct difference-in-difference-in- differences regressions to examine the effects of CJR on racial disparities at hospitals located in MSAs affected by CJR relative to hospitals in comparable MSAs elsewhere. Accomplishing these aims will provide critical knowledge for payment reforms designed to decrease racial disparities not only in LEJR but in health care more broadly."
"9271225","Storage of red blood cells (RBCs) is a necessary logistical maneuver to allow a sufficient supply of RBC units for transfusion into patients with a wide variety of underlying pathologies. However, storage of RBCs (for up to 42 days at 4C) is a distinctly unnatural process that results in damage to the stored RBCs such that 25% of transfused RBCs (on average) of each unit are cleared within the first 24 hours after transfusion. In addition to decreasing efficacy, the cleared RBCs have the capacity to induce damage to the recipient through both an iron bolus and also through the induction of inflammatory cytokines. In addition, it has been well documented that there is an accumulation of a variety of degradation products during RBC storage, with the potential to cause toxicity when transfused into patients. Included in these products are a wide variety of eicosanoids (i.e. prostaglandins and leukotrienes), which have the capacity to affect immunity, vascular tone, and coagulation. One of the distinct difficulties in both studying the effects of transfusion and also of managing the blood supply is the issue of donor variability. It has long been appreciated that there is wide variation in RBC storage from donor to donor with regards to post-transfusion survival of RBCs. More recently, we have observed that this variation has a basis in underlying metabolic pathways in humans (as studied in project 1 of this application). In the current application, we have applied a tractable mouse model to this issue, and have observed that in mice (as in humans), there is substantial variability in RBC storage from genetically distinct donors. Our preliminary data demonstrate that B6 and FVB mice have profound differences in RBC storage with regards to post-transfusion survival of RBCs and generation of eicosanoids. Moreover, in parallel to human studies (see project 1), FVB RBCs have significantly higher levels of cytidine than do B6 RBCs. In this application, we propose a genome wide association study (GWAS) to elucidate the genetic elements responsible for differential storage. We also propose to go past association, to test causality, through congenic breeding of identified elements. In this context, the grant proposes two specific aims. Specific Aim 1: Identify genetic correlates of RBC storage biology and metabolism. Specific Aim 2: Investigate the causal role of candidate genes in RBC lifespan and storage biology."
"9275328","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Depression is consistently one of the top causes of morbidity and mortality, and veterans are afflicted more commonly than non-veterans. In addition, veterans are more than twice as likely to die from depression- related suicide than the general population. Despite current antidepressant medications, a disappointingly large number of patients are refractory to current treatments, all of which target similar mechanisms. Thus, new medications with novel mechanisms of action are urgently needed. Using animal models that can predict antidepressant and anti-anxiety effects in humans, we identified a novel molecule in depression and anxiety- related behaviors, the acid-sensing ion channel 1a (ASIC1A). Pharmacologically inhibiting and genetically disrupting ASIC1A in mice produced antidepressant-like effects in the forced swim test, tail suspension test, and following chronic unpredictable stress. Moreover, the effects were independent of and additive to several currently used antidepressant medications. Disrupting ASIC1A also reduced conditioned and unconditioned fear behaviors, which model post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other anxiety disorders. Together these findings suggest the exciting possibility that targeting ASIC1A will relieve depression and anxiety through a novel mechanism of action. To take full advantage of this possibility we need to know more about how ASIC1A is activated in the brain. The exquisite sensitivity of ASIC1A to low extracellular pH suggests that acidic pH might play an important signaling role. Supporting this possibility, we recently identified a novel current during synaptic transmission in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) that depended on ASIC1A and ASIC2, and was inhibited by the ASIC antagonists amiloride and psalmotoxin. Furthermore, inhibiting or genetically deleting carbonic anhydrase 4 (CA4), a key pH-buffering enzyme in the brain, increased this novel ASIC- dependent synaptic current. Finally, loss of ASIC1A and the associated current was accompanied by significant structural and functional changes at glutamatergic synapses, which we suspect may underlie the behavioral consequences of ASIC disruption. Based on these observations we hypothesize that ASICs and CA4 play key roles in depression-related synaptic physiology in the NAc and depression-related behavior. To test this hypothesis we propose to answer the following questions: 1) Do ASIC1A and ASIC2 contribute to synaptic and behavioral responses to chronic stress? 2) Does carbonic anhydrase 4 contribute to synaptic plasticity in the NAc and depression-related behavior? And, 3) can inhibiting or deleting ASIC1A reverse effects of chronic stress on depression-related behavior, and is the NAc a key site of ASIC1A action? The answers to these questions will provide important steps towards our long-term goals of better understanding the role of ASICs in brain function and behavior and learning to target these processes for therapeutic purposes."
"9275414","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Our long-term goal is to understand the pathogenesis of renal anemia and to develop new and safe therapies for its treatment. Anemia is a classic manifestation of advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD) and results from the diminished ability of the diseased kidney to produce adequate amounts of erythropoietin (EPO), the glycoprotein hormone that is essential for red blood production. Anemia associated with CKD or end stage renal disease (ESRD) is typically treated with recombinant EPO. The use of recombinant EPO not only represents a major cost factor in the care of patients with advanced CKD and ESRD, but also has raised significant cardiovascular safety concerns, which prompted the FDA to issue several black box warnings. While the administration of recombinant EPO to renal patients has been a hallmark of supportive care in Nephrology for more than 20 years, the molecular mechanisms that underlie the pathogenesis of renal anemia are surprisingly poorly understood. A key pathway in the regulation of renal EPO production is the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) pathway. Although the hypoxic induction of EPO serves as a paradigm for hypoxic gene regulation, the regulation of renal EPO synthesis under renal injury conditions is incompletely understood on both, the cellular and the molecular level. Over the last 5 years our laboratory and other groups have demonstrated that HIF-2 regulates the hypoxic induction of EPO in the kidney and liver, and that the HIF pathway can be pharmacologically targeted to treat patients with anemia. To understand the regulation of renal EPO production on a cellular and molecular level we have begun to use genetic and pharmacologic approaches to dissect the HIF/EPO axis in normal and in injured kidneys. Under this grant, we hypothesize that HIF-2 controls renal EPO production by regulating renal interstitial cell plasticity. We use genetically engineered mice to a) define the cell types in the kidney that have EPO-producing ability, b) to determine their contribution in the regulation of erythropoiesis at baseline and under hypoxic stress conditions, c) to characterize the role of the three major HIF prolyl-hydroxylases in the regulation of renal interstitial hypoxia responses and d) to examine HIF-2 function under renal injury conditions."
"9223634","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         It is estimated that there will be 140,430 new diagnoses of urogenital cancers and 30,000 associated deaths in 2013. Metastatic progression is the primary cause of cancer-related death. Managing care for cancer patients with progressive disease is an arduous challenge and poses an increasing financial burden on our medical institutions. Therefore, is imperative that we elucidate the molecular mechanisms that drive metastasis and identify clinical biomarkers that can specifically recognize invasive disease and rapidly assess therapeutic response. Fluid-based biomarkers are ideal for disease surveillance and therapeutic monitoring because they allow for non-invasive, repetitive sampling. The clinical impact of such a biomarker would be multifaceted by reducing healthcare costs, reducing toxicities associated with ineffective drugs, and improving the implementation of drug trials. In summary, successful implementation of active monitoring for recurrence and rapid identification of treatment response is synonymous with reducing morbidity, mortality, and the associated health care cost."
"9260961","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interaction between and among humans, animals, and the ecosystem has created an optimum condition for the emergence and dissemination of zoonotic, vector- and foodborne pathogens. These diseases impose a much higher disease burden on low- to middle-income countries because of several factors including malnutrition, poverty, and poor hygienic conditions. The lack of appropriate infrastructure, particularly skilled manpower to conduct regionally relevant and innovative investigations is a major limitation. In the proposed program, we hypothesize that by using electronic systems, the gaps in scientific knowledge, technology transfer, and scientific networking between partners in the U.S. and in East Africa can be narrowed significantly. We aim to address this by: 1) developing institutional eCapacity that will enable researchers to gain the expertise needed to implement innovative Information and Communication Technology (ICT) activities including on-line teaching/learning opportunities; 2) developing a tablet computer and mobile phone-based application for research data capture, crowd sourcing, and analyses, 3) providing mentored, targeted practicum ICT project support in the area of infectious diseases at the human, animal and ecosystem interface and 4) establishing regular webinars and e-workshops to facilitate scientific networking among East African partners and Ohio State. The proposed effort is built upon the foundation of two NIH Fogarty International Center funded programs: 1) D43 (TW008650)- Molecular Epidemiology of Foodborne Pathogens in eastern Africa (ongoing) and 2) R25 (TW008101) Framework Grant to Establish a Health Science Center on Global Health (previous). We propose to conduct four activities including: 1) Digitizing four professional and graduate courses using iTunesU and CARMEN systems building upon the successful launching of our consortium's first online course on Molecular Epidemiology of Infectious Diseases in January, 2014; 2) Adopting and customizing a mobile application for five current research projects conducted by NIH Fogarty Global Infectious Disease (GID) fellows using the MAGPI platform for initial phase and implementation of the iOS-based OneH Application currently under prototype testing developed by our consortium; 3) Cross-train 15 Eastern African ICT and Health professionals with Ohio State counterparts using intensive Boot Camps on ICT technologies including but not limited to iTunesU, CARMEN, AdobeConnect, Mobile teaching, ICT protocols, network security and policy, etc. The ultimate outcome of this program will be to strengthen the ICT capacity of partner East African institutes; sustain the current and previous NIH FIC-funded framework, research, and training programs (D43 and R25); and foster and strengthen intra-regional scientific networking in East Africa and between Ohio State and East African partners."
"9275428","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mutations in the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 cause amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Inclusions enriched in TDP-43 in the cytoplasm of spinal cord neurons in both familial and sporadic ALS are hallmarks of the disease. Two recent yeast genome-wide loss-of-function toxicity suppressor screens revealed the strongest suppressor of TDP-43-mediated toxicity is the ablation of the gene encoding the metallophosphoesterase (MPE) Dbr1, the only enzyme known to hydrolyze the 2',5'-phosphodiester bonds formed within introns during their excision from pre-mRNA by the spliceosome. Decreasing Dbr1 activity results in the accumulation of RNA lariats that are proposed to sequester pathogenic TDP-43, preventing it from interfering with normal RNA metabolism. Supporting this hypothesis, knockdown of debranching activity in yeast, a human neuronal cell line, and in primary rat neurons protects them from TDP-43-mediated toxicity. The high degree of sequence identity in the catalytic domains of Dbr1 proteins across all eukaryotic species supports the observation that Dbr1's influence on TDP-43 activity is similar from yeast to man. We recently determined the first crystal structures of an RNA lariat debranching enzyme alone and in complex with a synthetic RNA containing a bona fide branchpoint identical to those found in intron RNA lariats. Dbr1 from the eukaryotic organism Entamoeba histolytica (Eh) crystallized most readily, revealing several unexpected features of Dbr1 enzymes relative to other MPE family members. All Dbr1 enzymes are mononuclear, possessing an invariant active site cysteine residue in the position of the aspartic acid observed in all previously characterized MPE superfamily members, all of which are active as dinuclear enzymes. In addition, all Dbr1 proteins contain a highly conserved insertion loop not found in other MPEs we term the lariat recognition loop (LRL). Functional data coming from in vivo complementation assays using multiple Dbr1 variants expressed in trans in ?dbr1 yeast support the proposed mononuclear enzymatic mechanism, as well as the roles assigned to the various unique structural elements observed in the crystal structures. The structures also reveal the molecular basis for how Dbr1 distinguishes 22,52-phosphodiester linkages from the far more abundant 32,52-phosphodiester linkages. With these results in-hand, we are now in possession of the tools needed to test the hypothesis that inhibition of Dbr1 represents a novel therapeutic avenue to treat TDP-43-mediated ALS. These tools include: 1) large quantities of purified Dbr1 proteins from multiple species, including human; 2) a tested, robust in vitro RNA debranching assay amenable to high throughput screening (HTS) of small molecule libraries for inhibitors; 3) the ability to synthesize, in parallel with the HTS inhibitor search, branched RNA analogs through the introduction of sugar modifications and linkers in order to mimic the conformation of the branched RNA we observe bound to the enzyme crystallographically, which differs from the conformations of these species in solution; 4) an in vivo complementation assay to test the effectiveness of potential inhibitors coming from both of the pipelines mentioned above; 5) the ability to rapidly observe the atomic details of inhibitor?Dbr1 complexes to enable the rational design of compounds with greater affinity and specificity; 6) the ability to perform initial toxiciy screens of candidate Dbr1 inhibitor compounds using cultured human neurons; and 7) the ability to pursue the structure of human Dbr1. The completion of the work outlined in this proposal on the Dbr1 enzyme is required before testing inhibitors in cell-based and murine models of TDP-43 mediated toxicity in ALS can begin."
"9471107","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With this proposal we aim to further the development of novel and safe oral inhibitors of sEH for the treatment of peripheral neuropathy in diabetic patients. Preclinical studies with our candidate EC5026 demonstrated efficacy for diabetic neuropathy. EicOsis has selected EC5026 for its efficacy with good PK/ADME properties and stability to enter further development stages for this indication. EicOsis also tested the compound and a backup in vitro for off target effects against an array of enzymes, determined the potential inhibition of major cytochrome P450 enzymes, and tested for de-risking with a contract research laboratory. EicOsis has used these data as a basis for an application to work with Blueprint Development Teams to create a development plan and initiate studies to test the safety of EC5026 in Phase 1 clinical trials. To further develop the compounds selected from the completed Phase I application we propose here to radiolabel the candidate and backup to carry out detailed metabolism studies and develop the label as a tracer for human Phase I clinical trial. Additionally we propose to use conventional material to test for off-target toxicity in vivo and to explore the breadth of activity of the inhibitors in alternate pain models. The studies are designed to address understanding metabolism and the spectrum of activity which if lacking often prevent drugs from being developed. The results will empower scientists in the pharmaceutical industry with critical data that speaks to the wider spectrum of activity of sEH inhibitors as analgesics of the future."
"9276575","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Induction of heat-shock proteins (HSPs), such as via Hsp90 inhibition of heart shock protein 90 (Hsp90), is being investigated as a treatment option for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). This is believed to be mediated primarily via activated heat-shock transcription factor/HSF1, a major eukaryotic stress-responsive factor that is expressed in most cell systems and protects cells from cell death. Recently, we administered a CNS-permeable Hsp90 inhibitor (NXD) in cultured neurons and mice, and found that this upregulated not only HSPs (iHSp70, Hsp40, Hsp27, etc.), but also several pre- and post-synaptic protein genes (e.g., synapsin, synaptophysin, PSD95, BDNF) at transcriptional levels. We found that this inhibitor completely rescued synapses from the detrimental effects of soluble Aß in C57BL/6 mice, preventing deterioration in hippocampus-dependent contextual fear conditioning. Notably, when a specific HSF1 inhibitor (KRIBB11) was co-administered with Aß and NXD to mouse brain, it completely abolished NXD's effect. Furthermore, chronic treatment of early symptomatic Tg2576 mice (9-12 MO) with systemic NXD completely rescued the spatial memory deficit, as determined by various maze tests, accompanied by increased iHsp70 as well as PSD95 and BDNF proteins in treated mice. Most interestingly, NXD treatment induced rapid and sustained HSF1 heat shock-like response, as evidenced by nuclear translocation (active state) and induced iHsp70 expression, which was most prominently expressed in the pyramidal neurons of hippocampal CA1, as compared to distal CA3 or neocortex. Together, our findings strongly suggest an important role of HSF1 in synaptic plasticity; to date, its neuronal functions remained largely unknown. We hypothesize that HSF1 is a key regulator of synaptic transcriptome, and regulates a large number of genes crucial and related to synaptic functions; NXD's protective effect on synapses is largely mediated via HSF1-dependent mechanisms. Since the NXD compound represents a good candidate for future development of new AD therapeutic strategies, we aim to investigate in-depth mechanisms underlying its protective effects, with special focus on HSF-1 dependent transcription. Accordingly, three specific aims are to test several hypotheses that 1) HSF1 plays a crucial role in AD and transcriptionally active HSF1 is required for Hsp90 inhibitor's effects in mice, 2) HSF1 can globally modulate the synaptic transcriptome related to synaptic plasticity (LCM/RNA-seq) of CA1/CA3 dendrites), and 3) chronically activated HSF1 works equivalently as Hsp90 inhibitor in rescuing AD mice. Successful outcomes from this study will likely validate HSF1 as a therapeutic target for synaptic and memory disorders."
"9056328","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Cystogenesis is critical for early kidney development; however, if renal cystogenesis is delayed and/or occurs in an incorrect context, the resulting cysts can destroy kidney structure, thereby promoting polycystic kidney disease (PKD) and renal failure. Virtually all forms of PKD in human patients and animal models are associated with perturbations in renal primary cilia structure and/or function. For example, mutations in genes encoding the ciliary proteins polycystins-1 and -2 cause autosomal dominant PKD (ADPKD), the most common potentially lethal monogenic disorder in humans, while mutations in multiple ciliary proteins lead to nephronophthisis, a form of PKD that is the most common genetic cause of renal failure in children and young adults. Although maintenance of primary cilia structure and function appears to be key to preventing/treating PKD, it is not entirely clear how aberrant ciliogenesis promotes disease. Moreover, since there are no approved treatments for any form of PKD, and even the most promising treatments have significant side effects and/or toxicities, a more thorough understanding of primary cilia formation/function is critical for the identification of future therapeutic targets for the treatment of PKD. The long-term goal of our laboratory is to identify the mechanistic basis for ciliogenesis, and determine how aberrations in this process contribute to PKD. Our laboratory was the first to show that the highly-conserved eight-protein exocyst complex, which promotes targeting and docking of vesicles carrying proteins from the trans-Golgi network (TGN), localizes to, and is necessary for formation of, primary cilia. Notably, mutations in an exocyst protein, identified in a family with nephronophthisis, support a role for the exocyst in prevention of PKD. The exocyst has been shown to be critical for targeting Rab8-positive vesicles bearing ciliary proteins to the nascent cilium. More recently, we demonstrated that both the small GTPase Cdc42 and Tuba, a Cdc42 ciliary-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), regulate targeting of the exocyst itself to the nascent cilium, where the Sec10 component of the exocyst directly interacts with the Par complex. Most notably, we recently demonstrated that cdc42 knockdown in zebrafish causes ciliary defects and Cdc42 kidney-specific knockout in mice prevents ciliogenesis, which leads to a PKD nephronophthisis phenotype, renal failure, and death. Preliminary data show that tuba knockdown in zebrafish results in a similar phenotype. Based on these data, we hypothesize that activation of Cdc42 by one or more ciliary-specific GEFs is required to recruit the exocyst to the nascent cilium, thereby  promoting Sec10/Par6 stabilizing interactions that allow for the targeting of Rab8-positive vesicles bearing ciliary proteins to promote ciliogenesis (tested in Aims 1 and 2). We are in a unique position to undertake these experiments as we have all the necessary tools, techniques, and reagents. As proper cilia formation and function are critical for preventing PKD, further understanding of a major delivery route for ciliary proteins will likely identify a number of novel  candidate targets and points of therapeutic intervention. We also showed that Cdc42 and Sec10 disruption in vitro and in vivo leads to MAPK activation and an increase in phosphorylated ERK (pERK). As MAPK activation occurs in the nephronophthisis pcy mouse, and pharmacologic normalization of pERK prevents cystogenesis, we further hypothesize that inhibition of exocyst localization/stabilization at the nascent cilium results in abnormal MAPK activation that, in turn,  leads to PKD. In Aim 3, we will take a pharmacologic approach to test this hypothesis in our Cdc42 and Sec10 knockdown zebrafish and conditional murine knockout models, and will also exploit our recently described novel adeno-associated viral (AAV) vector, and retrograde delivery system, that allows for gene expression in murine kidney tubule cells. Taken together, our work opens up new avenues for the treatment of PKD: utilizing pharmacologic means to inhibit the MAPK pathway, and molecular biology to deliver wild-type genes to rescue inherited ciliopathies."
"9243094","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           In Veterans, gambling disorder (GD) is at least twice as prevalent as in the general public, and it  is associated with devastating outcomes including suicidal attempts in up to 43% of the patients. However, little is known about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying this disorder while such knowledge may be vital for the development of successful therapeutic interventions. Drug addiction models have heuristic value in this regard as GD is classified among Substance-Related and Addictive Disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition. Both drug and gambling addiction are characterized by decreased sensitivity to natural reinforcers and stress-like emotional states. In drug addiction, such symptomatology has been attributed to respective reward deficiency and anti-reward allostatic neuroadaptations. In the present proposal we seek to determine whether similar neuroadaptations exist in GD by integrating functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), cognitive psychology and psychopharmacology to measure reward and stress responses in 40 Veterans with GD and in 40 healthy Veterans. As a second comparison group, we will enroll 40 Veterans with cocaine use disorder (CUD) matched to the GD group by the addiction severity. Three experimental procedures on this project include: (a) evoking social reward and stress by visual processing of rewarding and stressful images, (b) intravenous administration of yohimbine, a noradrenergic agent that reliably increases physiological and psychological stress responses and (c) monetary reward incorporated into a gambling task. Our preliminary data using these procedures to compare GD and healthy subjects identified unique patterns of fMRI signal changes in the ventral tegmentum, nucleus accumbens, amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex and sublenticular extended amygdala along with related structures during reward and stress processing. In the proposed experiments, it is predicted that, in comparison to healthy controls, Veterans with GD and CUD will exhibit diminished and exaggerated responses in the domains of rewarding and stressful stimuli, respectively. The impairments in the GD group are expected to be less prominent consistent with more severe deleterious effects of chronic cocaine exposure. An association is also predicted between those neural responses and clinical characteristics of GD and CUD. Our finding will allow understanding the distinctive features of behavioral addiction, GD, vis-à-vis those of a substance addiction, CUD, and their unique contribution to the common addictive process. In addition to providing important leads for understanding and preventing the development of GD particularly in the context of chronic stress exposure, our project will offer insights on the pathogenesis of emotional numbing and stress sensitivity symptoms, which cause severe disability not only in addicted patients, but also in those suffering from other neuropsychiatric conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia and major depression."
"9210537","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Hyperglycemia is the major risk factor for development of diabetic retinopathy. Tight control of serum glucose levels is currently viewed as the primary means to slow progression to retinopathy, but the mechanisms by which glucose enters the retina and how they become perturbed in diabetes remains unclear. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of how hyperglycemia affects the outer retina (RPE and photoreceptors) and identifying methods to ameliorate glucose-induced outer retina dysfunction and early biomarkers of diabetic retinopathy is important. Recently, it has been shown that systemic reduction of the facilitative diffusion glucose transporter, GLUT1 will reduce glucose levels in the retina; however, these studies do not provide a mechanism or means to control glucose entry specifically to the retina via the blood retinal barrier (BRB). The first objective of this proposal is to determine if reductions in GLUT1 within the RPE leads to reduced retinal glucose accumulation within the RPE/outer retina, prevention of RPE dysfunction and early biomarkers of diabetic retinopathy in mouse models of diabetes. The second objective is to investigate mechanisms of GLUT1 modulation by insulin and to determine if abrogation of insulin signal transduction in the RPE can mitigate abnormal RPE function in mouse models of diabetes by regulation of GLUT1 expression and localization. We hypothesize that (1) hyperglycemia-induced increases in the expression and redistribution of GLUT1 in the RPE mediates diabetes-associated reductions in RPE/outer retina function and early signs of retinopathy, (2) that insulin also modulates glucose transport by GLUT1 in the RPE and (3) that blockade of insulin signaling in the RPE will exacerbate retinal pathophysiology found in a mouse model of diabetes. To test these hypotheses, a mouse model of type 1 diabetes will be employed to investigate GLUT1 expression and distribution within the apical and basolateral membranes of the RPE and determine if this is concomitant with an accumulation of intracellular glucose. To determine if reductions in GLUT1 expression prevents outer retina dysfunction, a haploinsufficient Glut1+/- mouse and mice in which the Glut1 gene is specifically inactivated only within the RPE will be utilized. To additionally assess how insulin affects GLUT1-mediated glucose entry and accumulation in the retina, conditional inactivation the insulin receptor (IR) will be employed to abrogate downstream signaling from this receptor. In vitro analysis of cultured RPE cells will also be used to determine if insulin treatment alters glucose transport through regulation of GLUT1 by affecting its association with a binding partner, GIPC and/or the E3 ubiquitin ligase, Nedd4-2. These experiments will determine the role that GLUT1 plays in outer retina dysfunction as a result of hyperglycemia, elucidate how insulin is involved in GLUT1 modulation, and identify a mechanism which can be targeted for therapeutic intervention."
"9298011","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT. Post-partum weight retention contributes to obesity for many women, increasing risk for cardiovascular disease and other chronic diseases and complicating future pregnancies. Lifestyle interventions have shown to be modestly efficacious for post-partum weight loss in randomized controlled trials, yet interventions with numerous visits are logistically challenging for many post-partum women. Innovative and efficacious treatment models for post-partum weight loss that fit into the busy lives of new moms are needed, and cost-effectiveness is critical for adoption. Facebook may be an efficient platform for delivering evidence-based weight loss programming to post-partum women. Delivering interventions via Facebook allows us to connect with post- partum women where they are, more fully integrating into their lives and daily routines. We have developed a post-partum weight loss intervention based on the Diabetes Prevention Program, tailored to needs of post- partum women and for delivery via Facebook. The goal of the proposed project is to gather critical preliminary data to finalize the design of a large randomized trial to compare the non-inferiority and cost-effectiveness of this post-partum weight loss intervention delivered via Facebook versus in-person group sessions. We will conduct a pilot randomized trial with 72 overweight or obese post-partum women comparing delivery of a post- partum weight loss intervention via Facebook to in-person group sessions. We will examine the feasibility of recruitment (especially the proportion of women unwilling to be randomized to one condition), sustained participation, contamination, retention, and feasibility of assessment procedures, particularly measurement of cost-related data, in both treatment conditions. We will describe weight loss as an exploratory outcome. Second, in pre-pilot and post-intervention focus groups, we will solicit women's feedback on posts with low engagement, and will iteratively refine these posts to make them more engaging. Finally, we will compare self- reported time spent on Facebook to participate in the intervention with application-tracked time on Facebook, changes in use, and time spent visibly engaging, to develop procedures for measuring time spent on Facebook to participate in the intervention that balance accuracy and participant burden. The proposed project will provide preliminary data needed to finalize the design of a subsequent large non-inferiority trial. Demonstrating cost-effectiveness in addition to efficacy of our Facebook-delivered post-partum weight loss intervention is critical to support widespread implementation."
"9206087","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Sleep loss leads to impaired cognitive performance and excessive daytime sleepiness. These symptoms of sleep loss are now recognized as major contributors to accident rates and decreased workplace productivity. Mice will be used to model two types of human sleep loss that produce daytime sleepiness and cognitive impairments: 1) Total sleep deprivation, which can occur due to vocational demands such as shift work or emergency work, and, 2) Sleep fragmentation, a pattern of sleep disturbance seen in many clinical disorders including sleep apnea. Sleep fragmentation disrupts the continuity of sleep and interferes with the restorative effects of sleep. Despite the fact that total sleep time is not greatly reduced by sleep fragmentation, we hypothesize that the physiological and behavioral consequences of sleep fragmentation will be similar to those of total sleep deprivation. The overall goal of this proposa is to understand the role of basal forebrain (BF) neurons in sleep loss induced deficits in wakefulness and vigilance. To accomplish this goal, mice will be used to test the hypothesis that BF GABAergic parvalbumin (PV) and cholinergic - positive neurons enhance wakefulness/alertness, attention, and cortical activation. Both BF PV and cholinergic neurons are hypothesized to be arousal promoting via their cortical projections. Hence, we predict that activation of these arousal promoting BF neurons can reduce sleep-loss induced impairments. Based on preliminary data, we further hypothesize that BF PV neurons will more potently enhance wakefulness, attention, and cortical activation relative to BF cholinergic neurons; PV neurons are also predicted to more effectively reduce the impairments in these measures observed in sleep deprived mice. Abundant evidence indicates that the BF contains cortically projecting and wakefulness promoting neurons that are important for cortical activation and wakefulness (e.g., large non-specific cell body lesions in BF produce a coma-like state). However, only recently have optogenetic methods been available to precisely determine the role of neurotransmitter specific neurons in the brain. Optogenetic inhibition of BF neurons in Aim 1 is predicted to simulate the effects of sleep loss, demonstrating the necessity of BF PV and cholinergic neurons in the sleep loss induced impairments. Aim 2 will determine if: a) excitation of BF neurons is sufficient to enhance wakefulness, attention, and cortical activation in non sleep deprived mice, and, b) excitation of BF neurons will reduce sleep loss induced impairments in wakefulness, attention, and cortical activation. Aim 3 will measure the single unit activity of optogenetically identified BF neurons to confirm that their discharge pattern is consistent with their proposed physiological role in the regulation of natural sleep and wakefulness, and in the mediation of the cortical activity responses to sensory stimuli. The following preliminary data support these hypotheses and predictions: 1. Inhibition of PV neurons reduces measures of wakefulness, attention in the novel object recognition task, and evoked cortical activation; thus, the effects of inhibition of BF PV neurons closely resemble the effects f sleep loss on these measures. 2. Excitation of BF PV neurons produces wakefulness and cortical activation and BF PV unit activity is increased during wakefulness. Compared to BF PV neurons, excitation of cholinergic neurons appears to produce a more modulatory, slower and less powerful behavioral and physiological response. If successful, the experiments proposed will demonstrate mechanistic links between BF unit activity, cortical activation, wakefulness/arousal, and attention. Thus, these findings will guide the development of therapeutic interventions targeting the subcortical arousal promoting neurons to treat the consequences of sleep disorders which are prevalent in the Veteran population."
"9269957","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is a fundamental connection between metabolism, aging, and neural functions. Considering that the nervous system centrally coordinates organismal metabolism and therefore its sequale, understanding the precise mechanisms through which the nervous system assesses organismal energetic state is fundamental to understanding aging and age on-set diseases.  Changes in flux through the tryptophan degradation pathway, also known as the kynurenine pathway, have been linked to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis as well as psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression. Blocking the tryptophan degradation pathway at various points ameliorates murine, Drosophila, and C. elegans models of neurodegeneration or protein aggregation. How one amino acid degradation pathway affects such a broad range of neurological processes remains a mystery. In the course of studying C. elegans feeding regulatory pathways, we made the unexpected discovery that a specific kynurenine pathway metabolite, kynurenic acid, is locally produced within the animal's nervous system and serves as an endogenous measure of food availability. Our preliminary genetic and biochemical studies connect this metabolite through a glutamatergic signaling pathway to serotonin release, which in turn, modulates neuroendocrine secretions including that of insulin. This is accomplished through serotonergic inhibition of AMP-activated kinase in specific neurons. As tryptophan is an essential amino acid and various tryptophan- derived metabolites have neural signaling properties, I hypothesize that the kynurenine pathway metabolites are an ancient mechanism that links metabolism to neural functions including neuroendocrine secretions that coordinate the intertwined pathways of metabolism, protein homeostasis, and aging.  I propose to use C. elegans to delineate the molecular circuits that link kynurenic acid levels to neuroendocrine mechanisms of aging and protein homeostasis. We will first establish the precise molecular links between kynurenic acid and insulin secretion from specific neurons, investigate the consequences of this neural pathway on organism-wide mechanisms of proteostasis, and define the regulatory relationships between the kynurenine pathway and various longevity mutants. Together, these studies will be a paradigm for how metabolism is sensed by the nervous system to regulate age related processes."

"9275322","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     This proposal examines the ability of estradiol to modify effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), a class of drugs widely-used for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). There is no clinical consensus that it is useful to add estrogen replacement therapy (ERT) to postmenopausal women with depression who are being treated with SSRIs. Our preclinical studies address this issue directly. We showed previously in 3 month old ovariectomized (OVX) rats, that estradiol (E2) administered either acutely or longer-term inhibits the SERT so as to produce antidepressant (AD)-like effects. However, E2 also blocks the inhibitory effect of SSRIs on the SERT so as to prevent their AD-like effects. Estrogen receptor ? (ER?) mediates the AD-like effects of E2 whereas ER? activation mediates its ability to block the AD effects of SSRIs. These effects were seen using the technique of chronoamperometry to measure directly SERT function in vivo. Similar results were also obtained with the forced swim test (FST), which provides a more indirect but behavioral assessment of the effects of SSRIs on the SERT. This proposal extends these observations in clinically-relevant ways by examining 1) if the age of the rats influences the effects of E2; 2) whether the length of time from ovariectomy to hormone administration impacts the effects of E2; 3) effects of E2 and age in rats expressing depressive symptoms due to exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). Although there may be no perfect animal model for the effects of estrogen deprivation in human menopause, older OVX rats are certainly more appropriate for these questions than younger ones. In Specific Aim 1 we will study the effect of age, by using OVX rats 10, 14 and 18 months old, with studies carried out 18 days post-OVX. In Specific Aim 2 we will address the critical window hypothesis of hormone action which predicts that ERT must be administered early after the menopause or after OVX to have a positive effect. We will use 10 month old OVX rats with studies carried out 4 and 8 months post-OVX. I n b o t h A i m s , in vivo chronoamperometry, carried out in anesthetized animals, will be used to measure the clearance of serotonin (5-HT) from extracellular fluid in the CA3 region of the hippocampus, which is an appropriate area of brain to study effects of both ADs and E2. ER subtype-selective agonists as well as antagonists will be used to evaluate the importance of ER subtypes in estrogen's ability to block the SERT as well as its ability to interfere with the inhibitory effect of SSRIs on the SERT. In addition, to behavioral measures will be used to examine effects of chronic hormone or drug administration: (1) the FST to evaluate AD-like effects of the hormones and SSRIs; and (2) the novelty-suppressed feeding test (NSFT) to measure their anxiolytic-like effects. Both agonist and antagonists of specific ERs will be employed to see how they alter the behavioral effects of chronic administration of hormones or SSRIs. Western blot analysis will also be used to study whether age or long term hormone depletion alters levels of ER subtypes and/or their associated signaling pathways and if long-term E2 treatment induces changes in these parameters. A final specific aim examines the effects of E2 in rats expressing depressive symptoms due to exposure to chronic unpredictable stress (CUS). These experiments will be carried out in 3 month old OVX rats to compare results to those obtained already in na?ve rats of the same age. In addition, to study effects of age on the ability of CUS to produce depressive symptomatology, these experiments will also be carried out in 10 and 18 month old OVX rats. Long term effects of E2, sertraline and subtype-selective ER agonists and antagonists will be evaluated using the FST and sucrose preference test. Our overall goal is to provide pre-clinical information relevant for the use of estrogen replacement therapy in peri- and post-menopausal depressed patients."
"9257249","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         A tumor depends upon many cellular processes for growth and survival. Angiogenesis, for example, allows the tumor to create its own vascular supply and thus promotes growth, survival, and metastases. Cell proliferation, on the other hand, leads to sustained cell division and tumor growth. The molecular pathways leading to these processes are multiple, complex, and often redundant. Thus, therapies which have the potential to target different pathways would provide an effective strategy for treatment. RNA stability/translational efficiency is one level of gene regulation which interfaces with many of these pathways. Genes critical for malignant glioma (MG) progression, including growth, angiogenic and anti-apoptotic factors, are regulated at the RNA level by a common motif, the AU-rich element (ARE), present in the 3' untranslated region (UTR). Stressors such as hypoxia, inflammation and tumor therapy are often overcome by upregulation of these genes through RNA stabilization and enhanced translational efficiency. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), interleukin (IL)- 8, Bcl-2 and other inhibitors of apoptosis (cIAP1 and 2), all of which drive tumor progression in MG are extensively regulated at these levels. ARE-directed post-transcriptional regulation is tightly governed by RNA binding proteins (RBP) that bind to these cis elements. Certain RBPs such as tristetraprolin (TTP) and KH-type splicing regulatory protein (KSRP) bind to the ARE and negatively regulate the mRNA target by accelerating degradation and/or silencing translation. HuR, on the other hand, binds to the same elements but promotes mRNA stabilization and enhanced translation. Since our initial observation of HuR overexpression in MG, there have been multiple reports linking HuR to high grade malignancy and poor prognosis in all of the major solid tumors (e.g. breast, lung, prostate, and colon cancer). In the previous funding cycle, we have demonstrated that HuR is required for malignant glioma growth in vivo. This background provides the rationale for the current proposal which is to investigate the anti-cancer properties of a small molecule inhibitor of HuR (MS444) in malignant glioma. We have exciting in vivo preliminary data showing an anti-cancer effect and no significant toxicity. We also have data indicating that brain tumor initiating cells, normally resistant to standard therapy, are particularly sensitive to the inhibitor. We have found that HuR inhibition may target a critical survival pathway driven by NF-kB. Our hypothesis is that MS444 inhibits glioma growth by disrupting the posttranscriptional regulation of key tumor survival pathways provided by HuR. The specific aims will use authentic primary glioma xenolines and mouse models to further characterize this nascent class (i.e. post- transcriptional regulation) of anti-cancer targets. The common occurrence of ARE-governed RNA regulation of growth and anti-apoptotic factors across many tumors broadens the relevance of this proposal MG. Specific Aims:  1. To characterize the antitumor phenotype of the HuR inhibitor, MS-444, in malignant glioma.  2. To characterize the molecular impact of HuR inhibition on the NF-kB survival pathway in malignant  glioma as a mechanism for the anticancer effects of MS444.  3. To assess the specificity of MS444 and other HuR inhibitors for binding to HuR and blocking mRNA binding."
"9262116","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Dementia is an age-related condition that affects 10% of the population over age 70. It is associated with loss of functional independence and high care costs (estimated at $159 billion in 2010). Prior to becoming demented, most patients pass through a stage called Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) in which deficits are mild and care costs are lower. We are proposing a pilot study of a behavioral intervention in MCI patients. If the proposed pilot study, designed to be consistent with current recommended approaches to establishing trial feasibility, is able to achieve its aims, it will provide a conceptual and practcal rationale to support a large, multi-site, randomized clinical trial (RCT) that tests the efficacy o combined physical and cognitive training in delaying time to a clinical diagnosis of dementia. a 2 x 2 factorial design with a home-based cognitive intervention (Cog-I) or cognitive control (Cog-C) and a home-based physical exercise intervention (Phys-I) or physical exercise control (Phys-C) enrolling older adults with MCI receiving meals under Title III of the Older Americans Act. The Phys-I intervention includes physical exercise focused on aerobic and resistance training for 45 minutes. The Cog-I intervention consists of computer based modules focused on executive cognitive ability for 45 minutes. The Phys-C intervention consists of 45 minutes of stretching while the Cog-C intervention consists of 45 minutes of educational programs and completion of puzzles and word games (Cog-C). Each of the 4 treatment conditions consists of 3 90-minute per week sessions for 12 weeks (36 sessions total). The aims are: 1) establish feasibility, monitor adherence to interventions and outcomes, and monitor safety and acceptability; 2) determine if combined treatment (Cog-I + Phys-I) has a positive effect on cognitive test performance vs. control (Cog-C + Phys-C); 3) estimate whether age, APOE, education, and baseline cognitive status are associated with response to treatment; and 4) examine mechanisms of action of the experimental intervention by tracking pre-post changes in trophic factors (BDNF and VEGF) and inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha). Identification of treatments that delay progression of MCI is of enormous public health significance as such interventions have potential to delay the onset of dementia and its attendant functional and financial losses."
"9269950","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Anatomical circuitry is the foundation by which information travels within the brain. Therefore, comprehensive wiring diagrams are fundamental for understanding how circuits control complex behavioral and cognitive processes. However, only sparse connectivity datasets exist for mammalian model species, and most are collated from tract tracing literature. This is problematic due to the large variety of methods, targeted areas, nomenclature, and assessment of connection strengths by different labs. Instead, at the Allen Institute, we created an entirely new, standardized, publicly and freely available, dataset (Mouse Connectivity Atlas; ://connectivity.brain-map.org) based on modern anterograde axon tracing and high-throughput 2-photon imaging methods to visualize inter-areal and genetically defined cell type-specific projections across the entire young adult mouse brain from ~300 regions. The Mouse Connectivity Atlas data reveals general organizational principles in healthy brains, but many details are still missing. For example, subclasses of neurons within a region projecting to either single or multiple targets are not always defined, nor are the layers of origin of cortical input neurons to specific targets defined. Higher resolution descriptions of structural connection patterns at the cell type, rather than areal, level will enable more accurate modeling and hypotheses on cortical information processing and cognition in health and disease. In neurodegenerative diseases that rob patients of cognitive abilities, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), pathology spreads in selectively vulnerable regions in specific patterns that resemble, but do not exactly duplicate, network architecture. Taking into account specific cortical projection pathways could thus provide a better structural framework for understanding, predicting, and treating disease. We propose to enhance the Mouse Connectivity Atlas through focused anatomical tracing of whole-brain axon pathways from neurons defined by their projection targets within and outside of disease- relevant large-scale cortical networks. This will be accomplished through the development of a combined viral- based retrograde and anterograde intersectional fluorescent labeling strategy, and our established, successful high-throughput imaging and informatics platform. We will densely survey and map cell type projections defined by target regions in the mouse default mode-like and hippocampal networks, which participate in essential normal cognitive tasks and are vulnerable to AD. New data will be integrated into Allen Institute online resources, providing external users access to raw 2-D images, annotated 3-D projection models, and other analysis tools. We will specifically test the prediction that anatomical classes of projection neurons within an area belonging to the functionally-defined default mode network preferentially connect to other areas within the network. We also propose to use this foundational dataset as a guide for generating and analyzing a brain- wide cell type structural connectivity matrix for an AD mouse model, which could facilitate research in the AD community on disease-related network dysfunction and propagation of pathology."
"9275376","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Objectives: The main objectives of this proposal are to: (1) define how oncogenic EGFR/MAPK signal transduction influences the expression of MHC molecules and, (2) characterize the impact of therapies that target the EGFR and enzymes in the MAPK pathway on anti-tumor immune responses and the response to immunotherapy. Research Plan: In Aim 1, we will use well-characterized cell lines to model human cancers driven by EGFR over-expression, oncogenic RAS mutations, and oncogenic BRAF mutations. These cell lines will be used to determine how oncogenic EGFR/MAPK signal transduction and the medications developed to combat this signaling, impact the transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of MHC class I expression. In Aim 2, we will couple these same medications with relevant murine tumor models to determine how these medications impact in vivo immune responses to tumor challenge, the expression of relevant immune system genes, and the response to immunotherapies such as immune checkpoint blockade and therapeutic vaccination. Methods: Using the above models, we will combine EGFR, BRAFV600E, and MEK1/2 inhibitor treatment with chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments to define the impact of EGFR/MAPK signaling on the recruitment of transcription factors and the placement of epigenetic marks at the MHCI promoter. Using reporter assays, we will define regions within MHC class I promoters that are responsive to EGFR/MAPK signaling. To explore more complex regulatory mechanisms, we will investigate how EGFR/MAPK signaling impacts the function of an enhancer-blocking DNA element known to regulate MHC expression. We will also determine how EGFR/MAPK signaling impacts the recruitment/binding of CTCF, a protein that regulates MHC expression by mitigating complex chromatin interactions, to sites within the MHC. For our in vivo studies, we will use therapy- responsive and non-responsive tumor models to determine how EGFR/MAPK inhibitors impact tumor growth, the generation of tumor-reactive and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells, and the tumor microenvironment using flow cytometry, functional cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) assays, RNA analysis and other approaches. We will explore the novel hypothesis that these medications have clinically relevant tumor-dependent and tumor- independent effects on host anti-tumor immunity that can be used to enhance the response to immunotherapy. Clinical Relevance: Inhibitors of the EGFR and MAPKs are already used to treat Veterans with advanced cancer with variable response rates. To help integrate these medications with new and developing therapies that are immune based, it will be crucial to have a sophisticated understanding of how these kinase inhibitors influence immune events in vivo. Indeed, despite the fact these inhibitors are already being combined with immunotherapies in clinical trials for those with advanced cancer, their impact on the immune system is largely undefined. By characterizing how these medications influence immune responses, we can develop a rational framework to optimize the use of these medications alone and in combination with immune-based therapy. In addition, by defining the mechanisms that govern EGFR/MAPK-mediated MHC repression, new approaches can be developed to disrupt the MHCI down regulation and resulting tumor cell immune escape that occurs commonly in cancer."
"9269939","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The maintenance of well-functioning mitochondria plays a key role in neuronal health. In the previous project period, we found that neuronal injury in several neurotoxin and genetic models of parkinsonian neurodegeneration converged on eliciting increased mitochondrial turnover by autophagy (mitophagy). While mitophagy in some models is neuroprotective, in other models, inhibiting autophagy reduces neurite retraction and cell death. We hypothesize that the capacity to replace damaged/degraded mitochondria through mitochondrial biogenesis is important in determining survival-death outcomes in this context. Preliminary data indicate a key role for extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 2 (ERK2), which shows an altered mitochondrial distribution in Parkinson's disease midbrain neurons, in regulating both mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis. We will utilize differentiated neuroblastoma cells, primary embryonic mouse neurons and in vivo mouse models to study the mechanism(s) leading to the observed decreases in mitochondrial content and function, study the role of phosphorylation in regulating biogenesis, and determine the neuroprotective potential for strategies to modulate mitochondrial content in toxin and dominant genetic models of Parkinson's disease."

"9277603","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tanzania is one of the countries in sub-Saharan Africa that is severely affected by the HIV epidemic. Despite substantial progress over the past decade, large gaps in implementing efficacious and safe HIV interventions remain - e.g., in male medical circumcision coverage and antiretroviral treatment (ART) and prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) uptake, retention and adherence. At the same time, funders are increasingly demanding evidence on the population health impact of their investments; and national policy makers are struggling with questions how to ensure financial and operational sustainability of HIV programs within the context of the Tanzanian health system. To find solutions to these challenges, we need rigorous Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, and Health Systems Research to test alternative models to deliver HIV interventions and establish their comparative feasibility, acceptability, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness. However, the scientists to carry out such research projects are currently lacking in Tanzania. This program thus aims to (1) train a critical mass of mid-level and senior researchers to (a) work as principal investigators leading independent research programs focused on questions of HIV program implementation and evaluation and (b) teach HIV-related Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, and Health Systems Research in Tanzania; (2) build a critical mass of junior public health and medical professionals who can design and successfully carry out rigorous research projects in HIV Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, and Health Systems Research; and (3) develop a sustainable Master's program in HIV Implementation Science and Impact Evaluation in Dar es Salaam. This training program will be collaboration between the Harvard School of Public Health (HSPH) in Boston and Muhimbili University of Health and Allied Sciences (MUHAS) in Dar es Salaam. Based on an in-depth needs assessment, we identified training gaps in three principal areas: HIV interventions; health systems and implementation; and research methods, including Implementation Science, Impact Evaluation, Health Economics, and Biostatistics. We have recruited training and mentoring faculty with practical and theoretical experience in these areas, as well as experienced colleagues for the Executive and the Training Advisory Committees. The primary training strategies in this program will comprise of (1) two-year post-doctoral fellowships in Boston and Dar es Salaam; (2) short-term fellowship training in Boston with ongoing mentoring; (3) intensive courses (which will serve as building blocks for the Master's program at MUHAS); and (4) research symposia. In total, the program will train 10 two-year post-doctoral fellows; 22 short-term post-doctoral fellows (12 post- and 10 pre-doctoral); and provide intensive short course instruction to 240 individuals."
"9206896","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        The persistence of the latent reservoir in HIV-infected patients is a major barrier to the eradication of this disease. Although combination anti-retroviral therapy (cART) is highly effective at suppressing viral production from the latent reservoir, cART withdrawal leads to a rapid viral rebound driven by the reactivation of viral transcription from the latent pool. In this project, we will develop a multi-targeted therapy that we expect will significantly reduce and potentially eliminate the ability of HIV-1 to infect target cells in the absence of cART. This combination therapeutic will target different key aspects of HIV infection, each of which contributes to sustained viremia in the absence of cART. These components include viral particles, virus producing cells, the CCR5 co-receptor expressed on target cells, and the integrated provirus. To clear HIV and HIV-producing cells that emerge during viral rebound, we have engineered a panel of anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies. These antibodies bind to various epitopes on HIV- 1 and have been modified to express functionally enhanced Fc domains. These altered Fc domains promote Fc receptor functions on myeloid cells such as antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), phagocytosis, and complement recruitment. We have developed CRISPR/Cas constructs that target and cleave the CCR5 gene. CCR5 gene cleavage in the CD34+ hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) population will lead to the differentiation and proliferation of CCR5-negative immune progeny that are resistant to infection with R5-tropic HIV-1. Moreover, CCR5 gene cleavage in differentiated leukocytes will also result in HIV-1 resistance. We have developed CRISPR/Cas gene editing constructs to cleave the integrated proviral sequence, so that infected cells transduced with these genes are unable to transcribe intact viral genomes. To deliver these CRISPR/Cas transgenes, we have developed lentiviral (LV) vectors that we will pseudotype with different viral envelope proteins and anti-receptor antibodies to direct LV to specific target cells. CRISPR genes delivered by LV are stably integrated into the target cell genome so that the transduced cells and their progeny are permanently protected from HIV infection. Typically, each of these approaches would be proposed independently, and efficacy measured against the absence of treatment. However, a key innovation of this application is to combine these approaches into one therapeutic regimen. In the first 3 aims, we will develop and select the most efficacious reagents for each of these approaches using a combination of in vitro cellular assays and in vivo assessments in the HIV-infected humanized mouse (hu-mouse). In Aim 4, we will combine the therapeutics and test them in the HIV-infected hu-mouse model, and determine their ability to suppress and delay viral production following interruption of cART treatment. We expect that these studies will not only develop clinic-ready reagents that will have undergone rigorous testing and validation in a pre-clinical animal model, but we will also demonstrate that combination targeting, like combination anti-retroviral therapy, is more effective than a single therapeutic in reducing the viral burden in HIV patients and in developing an HIV-resistant immune system. This work brings together the combined expertise of Drs. Susan Eszterhas and George O'Toole in the design of CRISPR gene targeting constructs, Dr. Bryan Luikart in the development of LV vectors for primary cell targeting in vivo, Dr. Margaret Ackerman in the optimization of antibodies for therapeutic development, and Dr. Dorothy Wallace in mathematical modeling of human diseases."
"9329266","Abstract Knowing the characteristics, connectivity patterns, and functional impacts of different cell types in vivo is necessary for understanding cortical circuits, which have been implicated in several neurological diseases. Inhibitory GABAergic neurons play an important role in increasing the functional capabilities and diversity of cortical circuits. Inhibitory cortical neurons can be divided into non-overlapping subtypes based upon their expression of parvalbumin (PV), somatostatin (SOM), and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). SOM and PV- expressing neurons have been previously implicated in surround suppression through lateral interactions and cortical gain control, respectively. More recently, it has been shown that neurons expressing VIP are recruited during specific behaviors in mice, such as running. These cells preferentially inhibit the abovementioned SOM- expressing neurons in layer 2/3 of the primary visual cortex (V1), which leads to disinhibition of excitatory neurons and a significant increase in cortical activity. While these previous studies non-selectively activated all VIP+ neurons together, in vitro work from our lab has demonstrated that VIP neurons can actually be separated into two distinct subsets based on their expression of calretinin (CR): VIP+/CR+ and VIP+/CR- and that each of these subsets preferentially targets different neurons. VIP+/CR+ neurons, which make up approximately 40% of the VIP-expressing population, target SOM+ cells in superficial cortical layers. This proposal aims to study the effects of selective optogenetic activation of these two subsets of neurons in vivo in order to better understand the circuit mechanisms at play. This question will be addressed by utilizing Flp and Cre double transgenic mouse lines (CR-Cre/VIP-Flp) and an intersectional adeno-associated virus (AAV) that expresses Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR- 2) under the control of Flp and Cre recombinases. After separating the VIP neuron population into VIP+/CR+ and VIP+/CR- subpopulations, extracellular electrophysiological recordings will be performed in V1 of awake, behaving mice using silicon high-density electrode arrays and record the single unit activity and local field potential in response to periodic drifting gratings of varying orientations, sizes, and spatial frequency. These experiments, which will be performed during simultaneous optogenetic photoactivation of each subset of inhibitory neurons, will demonstrate the functional effect of each cell type on visual responses. Subsequent analysis and experiments will separate the effects by cortical layer to determine whether CR+ and CR- neurons have different neuronal targets in each cortical layer, as suggested by previous literature. Finally, the activity of each of these subsets of neurons will be visualized during running and stationary behavior to view the effect of cortical state on each subpopulation of neurons and whether the increase in neuronal activity previously attributed to all VIP+ neurons is actually a result of a smaller subgroup of neurons. All in all, the proposed work will be valuable in understanding the functional connectivity and roles of specific inhibitory cortical neuron subtypes and how activation or dysfunction of these neurons affects visual processing."
"9230808","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with claudication experience significant disability and are faced with limited therapeutic options that include only two FDA approved medications Pentoxifylline and Cilostazol which have at best modest effects. A recent clinical trial identified Ramipril as a promising therapeutic agent that produced improvements in walking distances several times those of Pentoxifylline and Cilostazol and similar to those produced by supervised exercise therapy and operative revascularization. The mechanism(s) by which Ramipril produced these effects is unknown. On the basis of our work on the histopathology of lower leg muscle of claudicating patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD) and its relationship to leg function, we have designed the present study aimed at determining how Ramipril produces its beneficial effects in claudicating patients. Our HYPOTHESIS is that Treatment of claudicating PAD patients with Ramipril improves walking performance and quality of life by improving the myopathy of the gastrocnemius. Improved myopathy is a consequence of reduced oxidative damage, reduced TGF-ß1 production by vascular smooth muscle cells and reduced collagen deposition in the affected gastrocnemius. We will test our hypothesis by implementing the following Specific Aims. SPECIFIC AIM #1 will Test the hypothesis that Ramipril-mediated improvements of walking parameters among patients with PAD correlate with improvements in both the morphometrics and biochemistry of myofibers in the gastrocnemius of the impaired limb. SPECIFIC AIM #2 will Test the hypothesis that Ramipril-mediated improvements of walking parameters in patients with PAD, correlate with reduced fibrotic events in small vessels and microvasculature, in association with reduced generalized collagen deposition and improved tissue oxygenation, in the gastrocnemius of the impaired limb. We view vascular smooth muscle cells as the principle mediators of fibrosis in PAD muscle. In SPECIFIC AIM #3 we will use adult human arterial smooth muscle cells (AHASMC), in vitro, to test the hypothesis that the ACE inhibitor Ramipril, which acts as an antagonist of Angiotensin II type 1 receptor (ART1) stimulation by reducing tissue Angiotensin II (Ang II), impedes a mechanism in which Ang II stimulation of ART1 and exposure to hypoxia enhance proliferation of AHASMC and their production of TGF-ß1 and collagen, via stimulation of phosphoinositide-3-kinase signaling and suppression of phosphatase and tensin homologue, a master regulator of cell growth. If our hypothesis is correct, then the work in Aims #1 and #2 will demonstrate for the first time that therapy with Ramipril improves limb function and quality of life by improving the myopathy of skeletal muscles in the ischemic lower limbs. The work in Aim #3 will identify pathways by which hypoxia and Ang II collaborate to induce myopathy in ischemic muscle. Specific agents targeting these pathways could become new treatments for claudication and for more advanced stages of PAD. Finally, information from this study may identify new tools for precise staging of PAD, evaluating therapeutic interventions and identifying patients who will benefit from aggressive therapy."
"9275304","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Neural stem cells (NSCs) hold promise for the treatment of neurological disorders, and understanding the molecular mechanisms of NSC neurogenesis and gliogenesis is key to unlocking their therapeutic potential. The adult brain - including that of humans - harbors a population of NSCs in the subventricular zone (SVZ). How NSCs 'forget' the epigenetic memory of their stem cell identity and 'learn' the developmental programs for neurogenesis and gliogenesis is poorly understood. Mll1 (Mixed lineage leukemia-1), a chromatin-remodeling factor related to Drosophila Trithorax, can regulate cellular identity by mediating the application or removal of specific chromatin modifications. We previously showed that Mll1 is required for the genesis of neurons - but not glial cells - from postnatal SVZ NSCs (Nature 2009, 458:529- 33). Emerging studies indicate that distinct chromatin signatures at DNA regulatory elements called enhancers determine the transcriptional activity of specific gene promoters, but little is known about how the chromatin-state at enhancers is regulated. In Preliminary Studies, we show that MLL1 promotes the expression of neurogenic genes Dlx2 and Dlx5 by regulating intergenic enhancer elements (manuscript submitted to Nature Cell Bio). Our chromatin analysis supports a model in which MLL1 maintains enhancers in a 'poised' state to facilitate rapid gene activation during neuronal differentiation. Furthermore, we found that MLL1 is required for the localization of JMJD3, a histone demethylase capable of removing repressive trimethylation of histone 3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) at poised enhancer elements. To investigate the role of JMJD3 in adult neurogenesis, we studied JMJD3-loss of function in vivo and in vitro with conditional knockout and shRNA-mediate knockdown. Indeed, JMJD3-deficient SVZ NSCs were defective for neurogenesis, but not gliogenesis. Based on these new data, we hypothesize that MLL1 coordinates neuronal differentiation from multipotent NSCs by targeting specific enhancer elements, enabling their rapid activation by the action of JMJD3. In this application, we propose Specific Aims that test this regulatory model, which has broad implications for development in general, and further determine the role of MLL1 in neural development."
"9275292","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The immunosuppressive drug Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA4)-Ig (Abatacept) is an agent now being used to block inflammation and to prevent joint erosions and systemic    osteoporosis in rheumatoid arthritis. CTLA4-Ig is a T-cell costimulation inhibitor that suppresses CD28-signaling in T-cells leading to T cell anergy (dormancy) and resolution of inflammation. However, because both physiological (basal) and pathological bone turnover are strongly influenced by the immune response this could undermine the effectiveness of CTLA4-Ig in ameliorating skeletal degeneration by disrupting basal bone turnover. We thus investigated the net effect of CTLA4-Ig on normal basal bone turnover in wild type mice in vivo. Surprisingly, CTLA4-Ig was found to promote a robust increase in skeletal mass, due to a significant elevation in bone formation. These data were further ratified using a genetic model of CD28 deficiency, the CD28 knockout mouse. Our studies further suggested that this bone anabolic activity is a likely consequence of CTLA4-Ig----induced production of Wnt10b by T-cells. Based on these data we hypothesize a direct cause----effect relationship between pharmacologically induced T-cell anergy, T-cell Wnt10b production and    bone formation. In this renewal application we propose to intensively investigate this hypothesis in Specific Aim 1 where we will apply mice models to demonstrate that CTLA4-Ig promotes bone formation in vivo by inducing Wnt10b from T-cells. This will be achieved by quantifying CTLA4-Ig- induced bone formation in Wnt10b null mice and in chimeric mice bearing Wnt10b null T----cells. We will further delineate the specific T-cell subsets involved using chimeric mice bearing only CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells. In Specific Aim 2 we will determine if CTLA4-Ig potentiates the anabolic activity of PTH in mice and whether CTLA4-Ig can reduce the PTH dose or frequency of administration. Because CTLA4-Ig is a long acting agent requiring only monthly administration while Teriparatide requires daily injection, if CTLA4-Ig can replace Teriparatide or allow for a reduced dose, or more relaxed delivery schedule, this could lead to a more effective and/or less arduous therapy for patients."
"9206074","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The broad objective of this research program is to use a mouse model to understand the cellular mechanisms underlying alterations in sleep spindles in schizophrenia (Sz), a disease which is highly prevalent in the VA and which consumes ~40 % of the VA mental healthcare budget. Recent studies in Sz patients have provided consistent evidence for abnormalities in the number and intrinsic frequency of sleep spindles, a waxing and waning electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern observed during light non-REM (NREM) sleep. However, human studies are limited in their ability to decipher the underlying cellular mechanisms. Thus, here we propose to use state-of-the-art optogenetic techniques in mice to investigate the underlying neurobiology.  Previous basic science work suggested that sleep spindles require the activity of GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), most of which contain the calcium binding protein, parvalbumin (PV). Postmortem findings in Sz indicate reductions in the activity of cortical GABAergic neurons containing PV. Since TRN PV neurons are derived from the same developmental pathway, a plausible and so far untested hypothesis is that sleep spindle abnormalities are due to downregulation of the activity of TRN PV neurons.  Recent studies in Sz patients using the hypnotic, eszopiclone, which targets the a3-subunit-containing GABAA receptors expressed by TRN neurons, ameliorates sleep & sleep spindle abnormalities and improves memory consolidation. Thus, if successful, our experiments in mice could lead to novel therapies to correct Sz spindle abnormalities based on the manipulation of the activity of TRN PV neurons and thereby improve cognition, a core impairment in Sz.  Our experiments have specific predictions that shed light on the role of TRN PV neurons in the cellular mechanisms of spindles. We test the effect on TRN PV neurons and cortical EEG using optogenetic stimulation with Channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) (gain of function for spindles and NREM sleep) and inhibition using the proton pump ArchT (loss of function for spindles and NREM sleep).  Experiments in Specific Aim (SA) 1 will test if bilateral ChR2 stimulation will elici sleep spindles and increase NREM sleep, thereby also reducing auditory sensory transmission during NREM episodes. Unit recordings will show identified TRN PV neurons will fire in bursts associated with spindles.  Experiments in SA 2 will test if bilateral optical inhibition of TRN PV neurons will reduce spindles and NREM sleep, modeling spindle abnormalities in Sz.  Experiments in SA 3 will investigate an important and so far poorly investigated input pathway to TRN, arising in the basal forebrain. We will test if optical excitation of the basal forebrain GABA/PV input to TRN will reduce sleep spindles in vivo and inhibit TRN PV neurons in vitro, thereby testing the functional role of this anatomically documented pathway, with predicted inhibition of TRN PV neurons producing spindle reduction. In vitro experiments will test our hypothesis of mediation of effects on TRN PV neurons by GABAA receptors containing an a3-subunit, mimicking the a3-subunit effect of eszopiclone.  Finally in SA 4 we will test if bilateral  optogenetic manipulation of TRN PV neurons will alter memory recall in the Novel Object Recognition Task, thus mimicking the cognitive deficits seen in Sz. We predict Chr2 will improve and Arch T will impair performance."

"9322669","Dose Reduction in Pediatric Molecular Imaging Project Summary The radiation exposure resulting from medical imaging has become a public safety concern. Nuclear medicine imaging provides potentially life-saving information regarding physiological processes. Such imaging is particularly valuable in children and infants wherein the rapid and unequivocal diagnosis of developmental or pathological concerns is essential for the health of these patients. Our overall objective is to reduce pediatric patient absorbed dose while maintaining and even improving the diagnostic quality of nuclear medicine images. Dose reduction for pediatric patients is particularly important since such patients are at increased risk owing to the enhanced radiosensitivity of their tissues and the longer time-period over which stochastic radiation effects may manifest. We will accomplish this overall objective by: 1. Optimizing image acquisition, reconstruction, and processing methods to achieve the best image quality at the lowest possible administered activity; 2. Collecting imaging-based pharmacokinetic data for agents commonly used in pediatric patients; 3. We will develop online tools that compare dose and image quality for patients of different weights and heights at different administered activities with dose and image quality metrics obtained using the current consensus guidelines and; 4., investigate the sensitivity of the results obtained in aims 1 and 3 to changes in instrumentation. Collectively, these aims will substantially impact dosing of pediatric patients for molecular imaging procedures. Aims 1 and 2 will provide the data needed to evaluate whether consensus guidelines lead to dose reduction for all pediatric patients. We already demonstrated in the prior grant period that optimal dose reduction (i.e., reduction that preserves diagnostic image quality) requires an accounting of both patient height and weight. Aim 3 will provide the tools to enable professional organizations to rigorously evaluate and likely refine or provide alternatives to consensus dose guidelines. Any guideline or dose- reduction effort that endeavors to maintain diagnostic image quality will be susceptible to imaging instrumentation variability. In Aim 4, we examine the impact of this variability on both already established consensus guidelines and also on the optimization scheme that we propose to develop via aims 1-3. By using state-of-the-art computational simulation, image quality evaluation, and radiation dosimetry tools (many of which were developed by the investigators), the work proposed in this grant application will apply dose reduction methods in a much more rigorous and scientifically validated manner. We expect that completion of the proposed studies will allow the molecular imaging community to introduce and, consistent with the realities of clinical practice, implement pediatric dose-reduction approaches that substantially improve upon current guidelines and that also point to future technological advances that could yield even greater dose-reduction while simultaneously improving diagnostic image quality."
"9269239","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The core mission of the pre-doctoral Developmental Biology Training Program (DBTP) is to produce highly qualified, independent research scientists who are trained to take a broad interdisciplinary approach to developmental biology problems. This mission is consistent with the philosophy of the Division of Biological Sciences (BSD) at the University of Chicago, which seeks to avoid artificial boundaries between disciplines and to encourage broad based interaction and collaboration. The interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of the DBTP is enhanced by the structure of the BSD: researchers in all of the clinical and basic science departments are housed in close proximity and united under one administrative and intellectual framework. The DBTP trainers are a vibrant group of thirty-two well-funded researchers, including both experienced senior faculty and talented junior faculty, who are based in nine different basic science and clinical departments.  To produce researchers trained in a variety of areas relevant to human health and disease, the DBTP builds on long-standing University of Chicago strengths in developmental biology: of particular importance in this context is the research being conducted in the genetics of model organisms, in mouse molecular genetics, in evolutionary developmental biology, and in developmental neurobiology. Further, during this first funding period, strategic new hires have enabled the program to expand or develop research strengths in the following areas: the cellular basis of development, stem cell biology, and the use of computation/modeling/systems level approaches in developing systems.  DBTP trainees are carefully selected from six interdisciplinary graduate training programs: training grant support begins as they enter their second year of graduate studies and generally extends for two years, subject to competitive renewal. We propose to continue to support four trainees each year, allowing us to be highly selective while maintaining a critical cohort of current and previous trainees. Trainees benefit from a strategically designed curriculum that includes three core and three supplemental formal courses in developmental biology, and from an extensive range of supplemental training-related activities. Among these activities are the DBTP sponsored developmental biology Seminar Series and journal/data presentation club, an annual retreat, biennial DBTP mini-retreats, and a biannual, student-run, one-day DBTP symposium. In summary, the DBTP integrates a wide range of varied training approaches to prepare exceptional future leaders in developmental biology research and education."
"9275445","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Overweight, older Veterans with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes and its macro- and microvascular complications. Impaired circulating angiogenic cell (CAC) mobilization and reduced CAC function may contribute to the development of vascular complications in IGT because CACs participate in angiogenesis and vascular maintenance. This study tests the hypothesis that 6-month aerobic exercise (AEX) training will improve CAC mobilization and function in older Veterans with IGT by increasing angiogenic growth factor levels and reducing inflammation and CAC oxidative stress, and that the improvements in CACs will translate to better vascular function and insulin sensitivity. This will be tested in older Veterans with IGT and normal glucose tolerance (NGT) through two aims. Aim 1: Determine the effects of AEX training on CAC mobilization and function in age and BMI- matched older Veterans with IGT and NGT. A) We will assess circulating and skeletal muscle angiogenic growth factor levels (VEGF and SDF-1) and CAC mobilization in response to an acute bout of exercise to determine whether these are reduced in subjects with IGT vs. NGT, and whether these increase after AEX training in both groups. B) We will measure ex vivo CAC tube formation using serum and freshly-isolated CACs from older subjects with IGT and NGT to determine whether inflammatory cytokines (?circulating CRP, IL-6 and TNF?) and/or oxidative stress in CACs (?superoxide, ?Nox2, and ?SOD-1) impair CAC tube formation in IGT vs. NGT, and whether 6-month AEX+WL increases CAC tube formation in both groups. Aim 2: Determine whether AEX training-induced effects on CAC mobilization and function translate to in vivo vascular function and insulin sensitivity in older Veterans by measuring skeletal muscle capillary density, brachial artery endothelial reactivity, microvascular blood flow, and insulin sensitivity before and after 6-month AEX training.  We will enroll 32 sedentary, overweight-obese (BMI 25-35kg/m2) older (50-75 years) Veterans with IGT and 32 sex-, age-, and BMI-matched Veterans with NGT who will undergo 6-month AEX training. Before and after the intervention, subjects will undergo a) acute exercise tests to assess CAC mobilization and angiogenic growth factor levels, b) blood sampling to assess CAC function, c) skeletal muscle sampling to measure capillary density and angiogenic growth factor expression, d) vascular testing to assess endothelial vasoreactivity and microvascular blood flow, e) hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamps to measure insulin sensitivity, and f) cardiorespiratory fitness testing and determination of body composition. ANOVA models will be used to determine abnormalities in CAC mobilization and function in IGT vs. NGT at baseline, as well as changes with AEX training in both groups. Regression analyses will determine whether changes in CAC mobilization and function are associated with improvements in skeletal muscle capillary density and endothelial vasoreactivity, and whether improvements in vascular outcomes are associated with increases in insulin sensitivity.  This patient-oriented translational research proposal uses innovative approaches to study mechanisms regulating CAC mobilization and function in older subjects with IGT and NGT, and translate these findings to clinically-relevant measures of vascular function and insulin sensitivity. Currently, the macro- and microvascular complications (e.g., retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy) of insulin resistance result in substantial VA health care costs and significantly impair the quality of life of older Veterans. We are optimistic that tis study will provide VA with therapeutic and programmatic directions to improve vascular health in insulin resistant older Veterans. This may reduce the progression of IGT to type 2 diabetes and its associated vascular complications, lower medical costs related to treatment of these cardiovascular disease complications, and improve the health of our Nation's Veterans."
"9275444","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Soldiers in the war zone are at high risk for potentially significant repercussions resulting from combat experiences. Combat stress can lead to a number of highly impactful emotional and cognitive conditions, most notably Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), and mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI). The primary goal of affective neuroscience is to effectively identify the neural substrates that define mental disorders. While cross-sectional brain imaging research has provided enormous insight into the mechanisms of major mental disorders, these conditions are by nature dynamic and a snapshot of the turbulence of these conditions provides a limited methodology for understanding how changes in symptoms are reflected in the underlying brain mechanisms. Our application attempts to use an approach that maps these dynamic conditions over time using 3 sessions spaced 9 month apart to measure the dynamics in brain processing in Veterans with significant combat exposure. This approach will enable a better understanding of the fluctuation and dynamics of the neural systems involved in PTSD, in the context of MDD and mTBI. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) allows for measurement of the hemodynamic brain response during specific processes, such as anticipation of aversive stimuli, which are relevant to the pathophysiology of PTSD. The goal of this application is to determine the brain mechanisms that delineate PTSD and determine how these mechanisms can predict poor clinical course. We posit that measurement of the dynamic change in brain response to anticipatory stress can incorporate the fluctuations clinical course of PTSD, MDD, and mTBI. Conversely, these fluctuations often obscure understanding of brain processing when assessed cross-sectionally. We will examine this hypothesis by pursuing the following three specific aims: (1) Identify cross- sectionally neural biomarkers of combat-related PTSD and determine if these biomarkers are sufficiently sensitive and specific; (2) Determine the extent to which brain activation to anticipatory stress at baseline predicts changes in PTSD symptom severity at follow-up and (3) Determine the extent to which specific candidate neural biomarkers reflect the clinical course of PTSD and key comorbid disorders and how these regions differentially recruit modulatory networks. In the short term, this research may contribute to the development of well-developed neural models of these disorders in our Veteran population. In the long term, this research will lay the foundation for studies aimed at determining candidate neural biomarkers that can provide an objective neural representation of disease course for therapeutic intervention studies."

"9473990","DESCRIPTION: The ultimate goal of this project is to develop an immunotherapy for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 based on a spread-deficient cytomegalovirus (CMV)-derived vaccine expressing tailored antigens designed for maximal coverage of clade B epitopes. In non-human primate models, rhesus CMV-vectored vaccines demonstrated unprecedented protection against highly virulent simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV). After initial infection, SI was ultimately cleared from protected animals suggesting that CMV-vectors can provide a therapeutic effect in infected individuals. CMV vectors are unique in multiple aspects: they can induce and maintain high levels of circulating and tissue-resident effector memory T cells even when vectors are spread-deficient in vivo. Moreover, in the absence of viral gene products that control T cell priming, CMV vectors induce T cells to unconventional epitopes including MHC-II restricted CD8+ T cells. Importantly, CMV vectors can be used repeatedly and in CMV-positive hosts without loss of immunogenicity. HIV sequence diversity poses a challenge to HIV vaccine design. However, unlike prophylactic vaccines which strive to achieve the broadest possible coverage of HIV sub-species, therapeutic vaccines can be tailored towards the actual strains present in an infected individual. In this proposal, we will therefore test the hypothesis that a tailored vaccine cocktail selected from a small vaccine panel containing HIV antigens optimized for T cell epitope coverage of a given HIV clade are superior with respect to inducing relevant T cell responses as compared to non-tailored approaches. We will use novel algorithms to design tailored antigens that maximize epitope-matches and we will insert these antigens into a new human CMV-vector backbone developed at TomegaVax during phase I of this proposal. We will monitor epitope specific T cell responses against specific HIV-strains using a recently developed NHP model for HCMV. Based on these results, we will design our final vaccine cocktail. To facilitate manufacturing of HCMV vectors under good manufacturing practices (GMP) we will generate a complementing master cell bank based on preliminary data showing, for the first time, HCMV growth in a cell type previously used for the manufacturing of unrelated viral vaccines. Upon completion of this project, we will have a designed, characterized, and developed a manufacturing strategy to generate clinical grade HCMV/HIV vector products."
"9346368","Project Summary  This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project supports the development of an instantly sealing vessel protection platform with enhanced durability against needle sticks. While Medicare spends over $30 billion annually on the treatment for end-stage renal disease, greater than 7% of its budget, $1.5 billion is spent treating preventable access-related complications. Many of these complications are directly or indirectly a result of repeated large bore needle cannulations and methods used to manage the access site after treatment. The technology will be the first product to prophylactically serve the AV fistula market and creates an untapped market with greater than $200 million in the U.S. This project will expand knowledge on methods to improve vascular access designed to address secondary complications instead of relying on conventional approaches of treating the complications after they have occurred. Success of this research will increase understanding on methods of creating materials for applications where closure and re-traversable access is desired.  The primary value proposition of the proposed technology is to offer a prophylactic means of protecting AV access systems that undergo rapid degeneration by reinforcing the site of repeated cannulation. In an effort to support our commercialization launch the objective of the scientific aims is to demonstrate the clinical safety and effectiveness of the patch system in addressing persistent access-related complications. Specifically, the scientific aim is to conduct a prospective, clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the patch technology in patients undergoing hemodialysis with an AVF."
"9275313","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death among US Veterans. The most effective therapy is surgical resection, but lung cancer recurs in approximately 50% of patients, most commonly as metastatic disease. This suggests that micrometastatic disease is often already present at the time of surgery, but below the level of detection of our current imaging studies. This is consistent with reports of circulating tumor cells in patients with stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although metastatic behavior is often considered a late event, these clinical findings suggest that the metastatic process is also operative early in the pathogenesis of the disease. These clinical observations are consistent with recent laboratory-based investigations indicating that dissemination may occur during early tumor development. Furthermore, recent studies implicate the genetic program associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), not only in driving metastatic behavior, but also in transforma-tion and stem cell expansion. Our preliminary studies indicate that key genes in the EMT program are responsible for both transformation and enhanced motility of human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs). In addition, we find that HBECs expressing genes associated with EMT or common NSCLC driver mutations show marked heterogeneity in their capacity for cell motility. We hypothesize that enhanced epithelial cell motility is operative during premalignancy and is a driver of early metastatic dissemination. The proposed research will elucidate the fundamental mechanisms involved in epithelial cell motility and their potential impact on disease onset and progression by coupling novel in vitro and in vivo models of human lung carcinogenesis and an innovative motility-based cell isolation technique. We anticipate that the proposed investigations will yield a more complete understanding of the molecular determinants of lung cancer pathogenesis, which will stimulate development of more effective chemopre-vention and early detection. Here, we have focused attention on the transcriptional repressor prototype SNAI1 (Snail) as a molecular driver of the high velocity phenotype, because we find that it: 1) is up-regulated in human NSCLC and pulmonary premalignancy in situ; 2) portends a poor prognosis when elevated in early stage NSCLC and mediates tumor-promoting phenotypes in lung cancer, including angiogenesis; 3) is a driver of the stem cell expansion, transformation, and metastatic behavior of HBECs in vitro and in vivo; and 4) is a mediator of the enhanced motility and deformability of HBECs in vitro. As these properties are important for metastatic behavior, we hypothesize that motility may also facilitate lung carcinogenesis and early dissemination via both Snail/EMT-dependent and -independent expression of motility-related genes. The studies proposed in Aims 1 and 2 will identify the motility-based pathway intermediaries that play a role in early metastatic behavior and carcinogenesis in in vitro human models. By determining the prevalence of the leading motility gene candidates in human premalignant lung lesions, subAim 2B will also ensure that our subsequent detailed mechanistic studies are focused on novel drivers of motility that are relevant to the clinical situation they ae intended to investigate (pulmonary premalignancy). Finally, Aim 3 seeks to determine the contribution of the clinically-relevant motility-candidates identified in Aims 1 and 2 to growth an early metastatic seeding in vivo. By coupling 1) innovative approaches to single-cell motility and deformability analysis with 2) a novel model of premalignancy (that includes the capacity to induce transformation to cancer in a human system in mice) and 3) a rare bank of pulmonary premalignant lesions (that ensures the clinical relevance of all findings), we are uniquely poised to identify the mechanisms underlying motility that are critical for early metastatic behavior in situ. This research is a prerequisite for future studies that focus on new biomarkers of disease onset and new targets for early detection, disease monitoring, and chemoprevention for lung cancer."
"9298693","A critical challenge in Big Data science is the overall lack of data ahalysis platforms available for  transforming Big Data into biological knowledge. To address this challenge, we propose a set of  interconnected computational tools capable of organizing and analyzing heterogeneous data to support  combined inquiries and to de-convolute complex relationships embedded within large-scale data. We  demonstrate its utility with a cardiovascular-centric platform that is easily generalizable to similar efforts in  other disciplines. Our Center has designed a federated data architecture of existing resources  substantiated by a solid and growing user base, and innovations to elevate functionality. Novel  crowdsourcing and text-mining methods will extract the wealth of untapped knowledge embedded in  biomedical literature, and novel in-depth proteomics analytical tools will unprecedentedly elucidate  dynamic protein features. A key strength of our platform will be the rigorous validation using clinical data  from Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Active Longevity (HEAL; Wellderly) cohorts. Our proposal  includes nine scientific aims that address three main focus areas: (i) we will build a new model platform that  amalgamates community-supported Big Data resources, enabling data annotations and collaborative  analyses; (ii) we will integrate molecular data with drug and disease information, both structured and  unstructured, for knowledge aggregation, and (iii) we will create on-the-cloud analytical and modeling tools  to power in-depth protein discoveries. Specifically, we will create a novel distributed query system and  cloud-based infrastructure that is capable of providing unified access to multi-omics datasets; we will  develop computational and crowdsourcing methods to systematically define relationships between genes,  proteins, diseases, and drugs from the literature, emphasizing cardiovascular medicine; we will rally  community participation and promote awareness of collaborative research through outreach and educational  games; we will create a platform to analyze and visualize multi-scale pathway models of genes, proteins,  and metabolites; we will develop tools and algorithms to mechanistically model spatiotemporal protein  networks in organelles and to. predict higher physiological phenotypes; and we will correlate individual  phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles to examine cardiovascular disease  mechanisms. These tools will be implemented, delivered, and executed on the cloud infrastructure to  minimize the computational power required of users."
"9348465","This SBIR Fast-Track application focuses on the development of a nanoconstruct for co-delivery of siRNA and chemotherapy drugs to drug-resistant human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer. HER2+ breast cancer is a subtype that presents HER2 overexpression and accounts for 15-25% of invasive breast cancers. HER2+ breast cancer has poor prognosis despite the rigorous current first-line treatment using two HER2-targeted therapies (trastuzumab and pertuzumab) and one taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel). The drug combination requires 6 hours of infusion time, costs over $250,000 per treatment course, and has many severe adverse events, while achieving a progression-free survival of only 18 months. To address these shortcomings, we seek to develop a single therapy that can replace the three-drug combination. We will incorporate a taxane onto our recently developed nanoconstruct for targeted delivery of siRNA against HER2 (siHER2). The nanoconstruct is a hybrid of a 50-nm mesoporous silica nanoparticle (MSNP) and a co-polymer coating. It is conjugated with HER2 antibodies for targeted delivery. SiRNA is loaded last and was fully protected under PEG layer from blood enzymatic degradation for 24 hours (vs. <30 min as free siRNA). The siHER2-nanoconstruct reduced >80% HER2 protein levels, and was shown to overcome cancer resistance to trastuzumab and pertuzumab, which only block HER2 activity. It induced apoptotic death of HER2+ cells, but was safe to HER2- or organ cells in culture. The nanoconstruct had an excellent safety profile in blood, immune cells, general health, kidney and liver of mice. Sol-gel MSNP synthesis and layer-by-layer surface modification afford high synthesis reproducibility and scalability. MSNP is also known for its high surface area and silanol chemistry, suitable for loading hydrophobic drugs like taxanes. In mice, the siHER2-nanoconstruct inhibited growth of orthotopic tumors resistant to trastuzumab and paclitaxel but did not eradicate the tumors. Thus, as in the first line therapy, we incorporated a low dose of taxane onto MSNP core of the siHER2-nanoconstructs, which maximized cancer cell death in vitro. In Phase I (Aim 1), we will further optimize our nanoconstruct in terms of taxane and siHER2 loading and screen them for optimal size, drug release profile, efficacy in HER2+ cancer cells, and safety to normal cells. In Phase II, the optimized nanoconstruct will be evaluated for in vivo efficacy and PK profile in Aim 2 and the safety to blood, immune cells, organ function and overall health of mice in Aim 3. Both primary orthotopic tumor and metastasis models will be utilized, with the aforementioned first-line therapy as the benchmark. Results will provide important data towards an investigational new drug (IND) application to the FDA. This project is a collaboration between PDX Pharmaceuticals, LLC, specialized in material optimization, characterization, and screening in vitro, and the Dept. of Biomedical Engineering and Knight Cancer Institute of the OHSU School of Medicine, specialized in cancer biology and drug evaluation in tumor models."
"9308579","PROJECT SUMMARY Recombination during meiosis serves multiple biological roles. Recombination diversifies genomes by shuffling combinations of mutations, thereby increasing genetic variation and enhancing the efficiency of natural selection. In many species, recombination also ensures that chromosomes segregate properly during gametogenesis. Although these roles should impose strong selective constraints on recombination, recombination rate varies among individuals. This unexpected result raises a major unanswered question: what processes govern variation in recombination rate in nature? Importantly, we still lack a basic picture of how the heritable component of recombination rate varies within and between species ? information that is required for understanding how any phenotype evolves. Two clues about potential determinants of natural variation come from recent studies targeting recombination mechanisms. First, the two sexes present contrasting recombination landscapes and meiotic constraints, raising the prediction that males and females will display discordant patterns of inter-individual variation. Second, there is new evidence that the number of DNA double-strand breaks and the proportion of breaks repaired as crossovers also show differences among individuals, suggesting that these traits could explain natural variation in recombination rate. The proposed research will provide a much-needed portrait of natural genetic variation in recombination rate across multiple evolutionary scales. The contributions of sex and key meiotic processes to variation in recombination rate among individuals will be evaluated. In Aim 1, we will measure polymorphism and divergence in the genome-wide recombination rate during oogenesis and spermatogenesis by applying immunofluorescence cytology to individual mice. Sex-specific, genetic variation in the total number of crossovers will be quantified on geographically global and local scales using a panel of house mice and their relatives. The prediction that recombination rate experiences distinctive evolutionary pressures in the two sexes will be tested through controlled comparisons between females and males across common genomic backgrounds. In Aim 2, we will use immunofluorescence cytology to profile natural genetic variation in molecular processes that lead to crossovers, including the generation of double-strand breaks, the regulation of recombination intermediates, and the assembly of the synaptonemal complex. By linking these traits to the total number of crossovers in the same set of strains, we will test the hypothesis that the decision between crossover and non-crossover repair is a primary factor in recombination rate evolution. Defects in recombination are a leading cause of fetal loss and a leading genetic cause of developmental disabilities in humans. By examining heritable variation in recombination rate and its potential determinants in natural populations of the house mouse ? a model organism for recombination-related disorders ? this project is relevant to human health."

Clearly, the future of biomedicine rests on our collective ability to transform Big Data into intelligible scientific facts. In line with the BD2K objectives,our goal is to revolutionize how we address the universal challenge to discern meaning from unruly data. Capitalizing on our investigators' complementary strengths in computational biology and cardiovascular medicine, we will present a fusion of cutting-edge innovations that are grounded in a cardiovascular research focus, encompassing: (i) on-the-cloud data processing, (ii) crowd sourcing and text-mining data annotation, (iii) protein spatiotemporal dynamics, (iv) multi-omic integration, and (v) multiscale clinical data modeling. Drawing from our decade of experience in creating and refining bioinformatics tools, we propose to amalgamate established Big Data resources into a generalizable model for data annotation and collaborative research, through a new query system and cloud infrastructure for accessing multiple omics repositories, and through computational-supported crowdsourcing initiatives for mining the biomedical literature. We propose to interweave diverse data types for revealing biological networks that coalesce from molecular entities at multiple scales, through machine learning methods for structuring molecular data and defining relationships with drugs and diseases, and through novel algorithms for on-the-cloud integration and pathway visualization of multi-dimensional molecular data. Moreover, we propose to innovate advanced modeling tools to resolve protein dynamics and spatiotemporal molecular mechanisms, through mechanistic modeling of protein properties and 3D protein expression maps, and through Bayesian algorithms that correlate patient phenotypes, health histories, and multi-scale molecular profiles. The utility and customizability o our tools to the broader research population is clearly demonstrated using three archetypical workflows that enable annotations of large lists of genes, transcripts, proteins, or metabolites; powerful analysis of complex protein datasets acquired over time; and seamless aQoregation of diverse molecular, textual and literature data. These workflows will be rigorously validated using data from two significant clinical cohorts, the Jackson Heart Study and the Healthy Elderly Longevity (Wellderly). In parallel, a multifaceted strategy will be implemented to educate and train biomedical investigators, and to engage the public for promoting the overall BD2K initiative.  We are convinced that a community-driven BD2K initiative will best realize its scientific potential  and transform the research culture in a sustainable manner, exhibiting lasting success beyond the current funding period."
"9346003","Project Summary In this application, we propose a week-long summer workshop and series of online modules to build the capacity of social and behavioral scientists to understand and conduct genomic research using NIH-funded resources, such as the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Our proposed R25 Research Education Program will open up the opportunity for social science researchers using these data to integrate genomics into their research by 1) offering a training workshop with a hands-on lab component annually at the University of Michigan, 2) creating a series of online tutorials that can augment the workshop or serve as stand-alone exercises, and 3) linking these custom tools with resources already available on the web. The course and supporting material will focus on providing hands-on training for researchers working at the intersection of genetics and social science research, using HRS data as a model, but broadly applicable to any social science study with genetic data. We will cover a biological overview of genetics and functional genomics as well as an introduction to current statistical and genetic methods for studying human complex traits. Hands-on analysis will be an integral part of the course and will utilize a classroom of networked computers with tutorial versions of the HRS core survey data and HRS genetic data files. Through discussion and by example we will focus on the unique aspects of analyzing genetic data in combination with social science data and will facilitate collaboration across disciplines among the workshop attendees and project investigators."
"9273312","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The WHO defines health as ... a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity. In fact, the notion that mental health and, in particular, subjective well-being (SWB) is an important proxy for social welfare is gaining considerable policy traction, with the OECD and the European Union supporting initiatives to use SWB to supplement or even replace traditional measures of progress such as GDP. While great strides have been made in developing measures of SWB and documenting their relationship with macro and micro-level variables, far less is understood about the impact of institutional factors, such as health insurance, on these measures. I propose a research agenda that will advance our knowledge of how health insurance impacts mental health - defined here as not only the absence of mental illness but also the presence of SWB - of the elderly. Recent evidence suggests the effects may be quite large: two recent randomized experiments have shown that gaining health insurance reduces the probability of screening positive for depression by 14-30%. With only a few measures of SWB and small sample sizes, however, these experiments can shed only limited light on the pathways through which health insurance affects mental health. My proposed work will fill in this gap in knowledge. I will focus on two pathways. The first and most straightforward pathway is an increase in utilization of mental health treatments, including medications, due to insurance. The other mechanism, which has received significantly less attention, relates to exposure to risk, stress and worry. Health insurance reduces exposure to catastrophic out-of-pocket medical expenditure risk and related financial strain substantially. My previous work finds that reductions in medical financial strain due to Medicare are largest among low-educated populations. Health insurance is also likely to reduce stress related to access to health care and to overall health. The elderly is the population for which this stress channel is probably most important: they have higher rates of healthcare utilization, larger out-of-pocket expenditures and higher risk of catastrophic spending. The K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award will allow me to build on my existing research strengths and to expand my work on health insurance coverage through Medicare to include SWB and mental health, areas in which I have no previous training. To ensure the success of the proposed work, I will be mentored by a diverse group of renowned scholars, with expertise in psychology, psychiatry, health services, health policy and economics, and behavioral economics. These researchers will guide me through a detailed training plan which includes guided readings, formal coursework and professional seminars and conferences. Such research agenda will help me reach my long-term career goal to establish myself as a health economist specializing in health insurance and its impact on individual outcomes, including mental health; successfully develop further research projects as an independent scientist; and become a key researcher in this field."
"9280281","The pathophysiological processes underlying neuropsychiatric disorders have been unknown; as a result, these disorders have lacked innovative medical therapies with new mechanisms of action. We recently identified the alleles underlying the human genome's largest population-level influence on risk of schizophrenia ? a series of structural alleles of the complement C4A and C4B genes, each of which appears to affect schizophrenia risk in proportion to the amount of C4A expression it generates in the brain. We also found that C4 shapes synaptic refinement in a mouse model of postnatal activity-dependent synapse elimination. These findings may help explain known features of schizophrenia, including reduced numbers of synapses in key cortical regions and an adolescent age of onset that corresponds with developmentally timed waves of synaptic pruning in these regions. The goal of the work we envision for a Conte Center is to develop our understanding of neural-immune interactions and synapses while also generating novel scientific resources that can be used to evaluate current and future hypotheses about schizophrenia-implicated genes, neural-immune interactions, and critical periods for synaptic refinement. Our proposed work arises from close, successful collaboration of scientists with expertise in genomics, immunology, and neuroscience. We aim to accomplish our Center's missions through scientific projects and cores. Project 1 will seek to understand how CNS cells regulate the expression of complement and reprogram gene expression as they traverse critical periods in the maturation of their circuits. Project 2 will create mice that carry human C4 genes and alleles; examining how human C4 allelic diversity and expression levels affect microglia-mediated synaptic pruning and other processes. Project 3 will reveal the functional consequences of complement-cascade dysregulation ? both over- and under-pruning ? on circuit function and behavior. A Computational and Statistical Analysis Core will contribute to research in all three projects by facilitating analyses of genome-wide expression data and genome sequence data. An administrative core will coordinate biweekly lab meetings and outward-facing activities, including an annual symposium on emerging research at the interface of neuroscience, immunology and genomics. We hope to advance the search for molecular understanding of schizophrenia while advancing the understanding of brain development, the interacting influences of genes and environment on brain and behavior, and possibly general principles that could be applicable to the mechanisms and pathways that go awry in other mental illnesses."
"9265382","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose a new training program, Psychosocial Determinants and Biological Pathways to Healthy Aging (PATHWAYS), that builds on our established track record in pre-doctoral and post-doctoral training. Consistent with goals of NIH to encourage interdisciplinary training and research, the PATHWAYS program focuses on the junction of behavioral, social and biological research. In addition, our training program is positioned to meet a critical set of training needs that have been identified as central to NIA's Division of Behavioral and Social Research 2013 BSR Review Committee Report. Specifically, this report identified the high priority area that illuminates the pathways by which social, psychological, economic and behavioral factors affect health in middle-aged and older adults. The PATHWAYS training program will fill a unique niche in the NIA portfolio by providing cutting-edge training to graduate students and post-doctoral scholars who are focused on understanding the linkages among behavioral, psychosocial and biological mechanisms that codetermine healthy and unhealthy aging. We request positions for 2 new pre-doctoral trainees and 2 new post-doctoral trainees per year. Each trainee will be enrolled in the program for approximately 2 years. In addition, academic units affiliated with the training program and the office for Penn State Vice President for Research have committed a combined total of $831,950 in real dollar matching support to the PATHWAYS T32 training activities. This support will cover the tuition and stipend costs for up to an additional 6 pre-doctoral trainee slots over the course of the training program. The combined sources of funding will result in training a total of up to 1 pre-doctoral and 8 postdoctoral trainees throughout the proposed 5 year funding period. Trainees will be provided with the foundational training needed to integrate a broad range of psychosocial and biological concepts, and to use advanced data acquisition and analysis methods in their own research. Additionally, all trainees will receive instruction in research ethics and in approaches to research with underserved minorities. Faculty for this training program have active and funded research programs on various aspects of health in adulthood and later life and a strong record of collaboration and mentorship. Our expected outcome is to train a cadre of scholars who will go on to careers in research that explore the interface of stres and health in adulthood and old age, and who bring to their research knowledge of basic and emerging methodological approaches for addressing the types of multidimensional and longitudinal data needed to tackle key issues in this field."
"9232963","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common joint disorder and a leading cause of disability. Age and joint injury are among the primary risk factors for OA development. Since many Veterans are older and/or had traumatic joint injury when in service, they are at high risk to develop OA. However, there are yet no effective medical therapies to delay and/or limit OA development and progression, and this is an urgent medical need.  Progressive degeneration of articular cartilage is a major characteristic of the disease. Chondrocyte, the only cell type residing in the cartilage matrix, regulate the homeostatic balance between matrix synthesis and degradation, which fails in OA. Thus, one approach to rationally designed new OA therapies is to improve chondrocyte function by targeting pathogenesis of the disease.  AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a super-regulator of energy homeostasis and cellular metabolism. We recently discovered that AMPK activity is constitutively present in normal articular chondrocytes, but is decreased in OA chondrocytes, correlated with increased catabolic responses. In addition, loss of AMPK activity in chondrocytes is associated with inflammation, biomechanical injury and aging. Moreover, pharmacologic activation of AMPK not only attenuates pro-catabolic responses to inflammatory cytokines and biomechanical injury, but also promotes mitochondrial biogenesis and protects chondrocytes from oxidative stress. Furthermore, in our preliminary in vivo studies, we observed that berberine, a natural plant product used as traditional medicine and dietary supplement, and known to active AMPK, significantly limits mice from development of knee OA induced by surgical destabilization of medial meniscus (DMM). Building on these findings, we propose to test our central hypotheses that sustained AMPK activity is critical to articular cartilage homeostasis and that AMPK is a potential interventional target to delay and/or limit the onset and progression of OA.  We specifically aim to: (1) Define how AMPK activation is chondroprotective in vitro at the molecular level. (2) Determine if reduced AMPK activity in human knee articular cartilage, particularly in the superficial zone where cartilage degeneration appears to be initiated in OA, is a fundamental change in normal aging, providing a platform for OA development and progression. (3) Test the hypothesis that molecularly selective loss of AMPK activity promotes OA development and progression in mice in vivo (4) Test the translational hypothesis that therapeutic induction of AMPK activity by the highly selective AMPK activator A-769662 delays and/or limits the development and progression of spontaneous OA in vivo using the STR/ort mice (an established model for spontaneous OA that resembles human OA).  Completion of these studies will provide new insights into how changes in chondrocyte bio-energetics affects cartilage homeostasis, and aid to develop a new therapeutic approach by targeting at AMPK to suppress the development and progression of OA."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project will undertake an integrated set of data enhancements and user education, support, and outreach efforts to expand the research and policy communities' use of data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID), the PSID Child Development Supplement (CDS), and the PSID Transition into Adulthood (TA) Study. PSID is a longitudinal survey of a nationally-representative sample of U.S. families that began in 1968. With data collected on the same families and their descendants for 38 waves over 46 years (as of 2014), PSID is a cornerstone for empirical social science research in the U.S. CDS followed a cohort of nearly 3,600 children from PSID families who were 0-12 years of age in 1997 through three rounds of data collection, in 1997, 2002/03, and 2007/08. Beginning in 2005 (and continuing through 2015), when children from the CDS turned 18 years of age and completed high school they were interviewed as part of the biennial TA study. Together, the resulting CDS-TA archive provides up to 18 years of information on the youngest children in the cohort. Data from PSID, CDS, and TA are used by a very large group of users. However, the complexity and richness of these data can be challenging for new users and even for many experienced analysts. The goal of this project is to make the use of these data easier and more efficient for all users. The specific aims of this project are to: teach an annual course on PSID data analysis geared to new users of the data; assist researchers who encounter complex problems by providing high quality, rapid response user-support services and through online facilities for users; undertake a variety of enhancements to PSID data and dissemination that will make it quicker and easier for both new and experienced researchers to conduct research with these data; conduct an annual user workshop to foster exchange and interaction among new and experienced researchers; and increase the size and disciplinary breath of the PSID, CDS, and TA user community by conducting a variety of outreach efforts. The activities in this project will further increase the widespread use of the PSID, CDS, and TA data, and will promote efficient and productive use of these data by new and experienced users of the data archive."
"9210535","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Neuroinflammation following TBI exacerbates neuronal and glial death and dysfunction. The monocyte- derived macrophage response is harmful in TBI. However, macrophages are a broadly heterogeneous population and polarized subsets can be critical for wound repair. Our goal is to identify harmful and beneficial components of the innate immune response to TBI and to define when they arise, to identify optimal targets and timing for therapeutic intervention. The  ultimate goal is to block harmful responses and enhance reparative ones to improve long-term functional outcomes of TBI.  Our recently published study showed that Ccr2-/- mice had reduced monocyte-derived brain macrophages and improved outcomes post-TBI. We hypothesize that pharmacological blockade of human CCR2 will improve TBI. Our new data shows that a CCR2 antagonist, CCX872 (in Phase II clinical trials for nephropathy), given 5 min after TBI in mice expressing human CCR2 blocked 83±2% of the macrophage infiltrate. Aim 1. Determine the therapeutic benefit of the human CCR2 antagonist, CCX872, given after TBI, to mice expressing human CCR2 to inhibit macrophage infiltration into the brain, and to improve pathologic and behavioral outcomes.  1a. Determine the effective dose range and time window of hCCR2 antagonist, CCX872, administered after  TBI to block macrophage infiltration to the brain.  1b. Determine the effective dose range and time window of hCCR2 antagonist, CCX872, administered after  TBI to improve behavioral functions and histopathology.  Our previous published work and our new preliminary single-cell RNA sequencing studies indicate that TBI macrophages are diverse and are not limited to the M1/M2 paradigm. We hypothesize that multiple monocyte- derived macrophages and microglia subsets develop after TBI. Aim 2. Define the diversity of monocyte-derived macrophages and resident microglia in the brain post- TBI by the use of single-cell, whole-transcriptome analysis.  2a. Define the monocyte-derived brain macrophage subsets post-TBI by performing single-cell RNA seq.  2b. Define microglia subsets post-TBI by performing single-cell RNA seq.  In the absence of CCR2, a macrophages subset still infiltrates the injured brain after TBI, and is associated with improved outcomes. We hypothesize that CCR2-independent macrophages are protective in TBI. Aim 3. Determine the expression profile, functional role, and requirement for CCR2-independent macrophages in post-TBI outcomes.  3a. Define CCR2-independent macrophage subsets in the brain after TBI by single-cell RNA seq.  3b. Define the functional nature of the CCR2-independent macrophage response to TBI by examining  phagocytosis, cytokine production, and T cell suppressor function by these cells.  3c. Determine if CCR2-independent macrophages are beneficial or harmful by depleting them with  clodronate liposomes in Ccr2-/- mice after TBI and determining the effects on TBI outcomes.  This work will provide the preclinical basis and design for targeting CCR2 in TBI therapy. Furthermore, the work will provide an unprecedented view of macrophage biology in the specific context of TBI. These studies will lead to informed approaches for altering neuroinflammation to improve outcomes for veterans."
"9291865","Alzheimer?s disease (AD), the most common form of dementia, affects over five million people in the United States. A vast majority of cases are the result of late-onset AD (LOAD), which has a wide variability in onset, progression, and severity across the population. We posit that normal aging and AD memory decline result from common molecular pathways; therefore, we expect that the identification of genetic factors and mechanisms underlying normal aging will provide feasible targets for intervention against AD. The identification of genetic risk factors and mechanisms in humans has been impeded largely by the known heterogeneity of degenerative changes, the numerous environmental confounds that can exist in human cohorts, and the difficulty in obtaining molecular and functional data from humans at the preclinical and/or early stages of disease. Genetic reference panels, such as the BXD panel of mice, model a portion of the genetic complexity of human populations while controlling for environmental factors. We will use the BXD panel in order to identify genetic factors and mechanisms that modify the onset and severity of memory decline. We will measure memory function in our BXD panel across their lifespan (6, 12, and 18 mo) and perform subsequent genetic linkage mapping in order to identify genomic areas that correlate to disease progression. We hypothesize that multiple gene variants modulating memory decline do so by altering expression of hippocampal proteins necessary for memory, so we will also quantitatively evaluate protein levels in the hippocampus across the lifespan in BXD strains that exhibit extreme variation in cognitive decline (i.e. susceptible and resilient strains; bottom and top 10%). Candidate risk and protective factors will be selected for functional validation in normal aging and AD mouse models using sequence data, existing hippocampal mRNA from age-matched strains, and numerous bioinformatics resources. Pilot studies suggest candidates involved in expression of hippocampus membrane proteins that modulate neuronal excitability (e.g. Hp1bp3, Trpc3) contribute to individual differences in cognitive aging, and may also impact the development and progression of AD. Thus, up to 5 novel candidate genes (alongside Hp1bp3, Trpc3) will be tested by manipulating gene sequence or expression using viral delivery of genome editing constructs or siRNA, respectively, and measuring the effect on cognitive decline, neurophysiological changes and neuropathological markers of AD using established AD- related mouse models and age-matched controls. The identification of novel genetic factors and mechanisms of memory decline will be a critical first step toward the development of both mechanistic-based treatments and personalized gene therapies that would maintain cognitive function in elderly humans. The identification of predictive genetic variants or neurophysiological biomarkers would also have the tremendous potential to provide biomarkers for earlier detection and more effective treatment in AD patients."
"9206080","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a multifaceted disorder precipitated by exposure to a psychologically distressing event. Although, diagnostic symptoms for PTSD include hyperarousal, re-experiencing (flashbacks/nightmares), and avoidance, sleep disruptions are considered to be the hallmarks of PTSD. PTSD affects a large proportion of military personnel and veterans and is associated with numerous deleterious outcomes for veterans and active duty service personnel. The costs of PTSD to the individual and society at large are substantial. PTSD is characterized by impairments in fear and extinction learning whereby the perceived threat continues even when acute danger is no longer present and stimuli that are reminiscent of those that occurred during the trauma continue to provoke fear and alarm. Convincing evidence suggests that sleep is critical for fear learning and consolidation of extinction memories. However, it is yet unclear as to how or what sleep factor regulates fear and extinction learning. Recent studies implicate melanin concentrating hormone (MCH), a neuropeptide, in sleep regulation and in learning and memory consolidation. Thus, we asked: Does MCH have a role in pathogenesis of PTSD? Since PTSD is characterized by dysfunctional fear and extinction learning, we hypothesize that MCH may play a critical role in fear and extinction learning. We will use mice as our animal model and expose them to predator odor to induce contextual fear conditioning. We predict that a) mice exposed to predator odor will develop contextual fear conditioning and display fear, stress and protracted sleep disruptions; b) exposure to predator odor will activate brain regions associated with fear learning. We will use the cutting edge Designer Receptors Exclusively Activated by Designer Drug (DREADD) technology to selectively inhibit MCH neurons. We predict that inhibition of MCH neurons or blockade of MCH transmission, via selective MCH-1 receptor antagonist will attenuate fear learning. However, inhibition of MCH neurons coupled with local activation of MCH transmission in the hippocampus or amygdala will override the effects of MCH inhibition resulting in the development of contextual fear conditioning. We predict that extinction learning, after predator odor trauma, will activate infralimbic cortex, the brain region associated with extinction, and attenuate fear learning. However, inhibition of MCH neurons or selective blockade of MCH transmission in the infralimbic cortex during extinction training will attenuate extinction learnin. Overall, our project is innovative, translational and very relevant to VA care and mission."
"9267152","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although the initial events contributing to the development of Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) remain elusive, mounting evidence supports a crucial role for the innate immune system and environmental factors, such as viruses, in the progression of disease. Further investigation is needed to understand how innate immune activation leads to loss of immunological tolerance and ensuing beta cell destruction by the CD8+ T cell. Therefore, the long- term goal of this research is to understand the causal relationship between genetic susceptibility, precipitating environmental factors, and innate immune mediators in the initiation and progression of T1D. This particular application aims to assess the effect of Type 1 Interferons (T1-IFN) on beta cell and CD8+ T cell interactions in a human in vitro model of T1D. Previous studies have shown that T1-IFN are found in the islets of T1D patients along with increased MHC Class I (MHC-I) expression. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to increased MHC-I within the beta cell have not been well characterized. Also, due to the immunomodulatory effects displayed by T1-IFN, the presence of these cytokines within the diabetic islet may serve to modulate CD8+ T cell responses. The central hypothesis portends that T1-IFN alter the microenvironment of the diabetic islet through regulation of members of the MHC-I antigen processing and presentation pathway and by directly enhancing CTL-mediated beta cell death. This hypothesis will be tested through two specific aims: 1) Determine how T1-IFN regulate MHC-I antigen processing & presentation by beta cells; and 2) Elucidate the impact of T1-IFN on beta cell recognition and destruction by autoreactive CD8+ T cells. In Aim 1, utilizing beta cell lines and primary human islets, mechanistic studies aimed at characterizing the antigen processing and presentation pathway, specifically the immunoproteasome, will be performed.     This will be followed by in depth analysis of signaling pathways responsible for inducing these responses in beta cells. Expounding upon preliminary studies, aim 2 will investigate the immunomodulatory effects of T1-IFN in the context of CD8+ T cell cytotoxicity, specifically factors involved in the granule exocytosis pathway and TNF receptor ligand family. Furthermore, T1-IFN mediated signaling pathways important for the acquisition of CD8+ T cell effector function will be analyzed. A majority of the current knowledge regarding T1-IFN biology has been derived using other disease models. This research is innovative in that it seeks to understand existing paradigms in T1-IFN biology in the context of T1D autoimmunity. This research is significant because successful completion of these studies will provide direct evidence as to how T1-IFN modulate beta cell - CD8 T cell interactions and will provide a mechanistic link between environmental factors, immune activation, and T1D pathogenesis. Ultimately, the knowledge gained here will serve as a foundation for future studies examining the functional significance of T1D susceptibility alleles in T1-IFN responsiveness, which may lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches in T1D that specifically target the T1-IFN signaling pathway."
"9353711","PROJECT SUMMARY Over the past three decades, extensive health, economic, and social costs have been associated with obesity. Children from disadvantaged backgrounds are more likely to be obese, with weight gain in childhood continuing into adulthood and resulting in the early onset of cardiovascular disease. Such adverse effects are pronounced among women than men. Gender differences are also evident in socioeconomic opportunities, psychosocial resources, and emotional/behavioral coping strategies, suggesting that there may be gender- driven psychosocial, behavioral, and biological, e.g., genetic and reproductive, mechanisms linking early life adversities (ELAs) to obesity and cardiovascular risk. Nonetheless, some individuals who have experienced ELAs do not succumb to cardiovascular risk; they may leverage individual psychosocial resources to halt or reverse accumulated disadvantages from childhood, although the availability of such resources may also vary by gender. Few studies have employed an integrative approach to understanding the broader set of influences on gender differences in obesity and cardiovascular risk. The overall goal of this Pathway to Independence Award is to provide the PI with the interdisciplinary training and research experience needed to investigate how ELAs affect body weight and cardiovascular risk, via the interplay of psychosocial, behavioral, and biological mechanisms, while characterizing gender differences throughout the analysis. Having previously worked as a nurse in South Korea, the PI brings front-line experience to the task of understanding health disparities. During her subsequent training and research in sociology and population health science, she applied theories of social determinants of health to multiple nationally representative data sets. The PI is well along the path to becoming a leading researcher on gender, life adversities, and health. During the K99 phase, the PI seeks training and mentoring to broaden her focus beyond social perspectives to include epidemiological and psychological knowledge of (1) causal inferences in behavioral obesity research (including co-twin control analyses), (2) cardiovascular disease, (3) reproductive health, and (4) resilience. During the R00 phase the PI will develop an integrative life-course approach to study the gender-specific pathways through which ELAs affect risk of adult obesity and cardiovascular disease by combining her primary expertise in sociology with additional epidemiological and psychological knowledge. The proposed research will be based on a nationally representative longitudinal data set, known as MIDUS (Midlife in the United States), which began with 7,108 adults, including 998 twin dyads. Findings from the PI's research should be relevant for development of gender-specific interventions to reduce the risk of obesity and cardiovascular disease, particularly for individuals who have experienced adversities in early life."
"9379639","PROJECT SUMMARY The objective of this project is to develop DNA nanoparticles with efficient delivery to the local draining lymph nodes (dLN) via subcutaneous (s.c.) administration to promote dendritic cell (DC) transfection, antigen presentation, and T cell activation in the lymph nodes, and to elicit robust antibody titers and immunological memory against Zika virus. As the Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in Brazil spread around south and north Americas, Europe, and Asia, teams around the world have been racing to develop ZIKV vaccines. DNA vaccines offer many advantages in terms of ease of production, excellent stability with long shelf life, multivalent capability, and fast development cycle. The first generation of vaccine candidates is built with the pre-membrane and envelope sequences from a Brazilian ZIKV strain as the dominant immunogen. They have been tested as naked plasmid DNA vaccines administered by intramuscular (i.m.) injection, and generated effective neutralizing antibodies in mice and nonhuman primates. However, naked DNA vaccine inherently has low efficiency to generate Th2 response and immune memory, and requires higher DNA dose due to the low abundance of antigen presenting cells (APCs) at the injection site. This study will directly address these challenges by combining two novel approaches to engineer a more potent ZIKV DNA vaccine: (1) a chimeric DNA construct encoding ZIKA envelope protein sequences and lysosomal-associated membrane protein-1 (LAMP), which can direct the expressed antigen to MHC Class II-rich compartment, thus skewing ZIKV antigen presentation towards a strongly Th2-biased response and generation of immune memory; and (2) flash nanocomplexation (FNC)-produced small (~40 nm) ZIKV/LAMP DNA nanoparticles to enable drainage to the dLNs following s.c. injection, thus enhancing the immune response and allowing for substantial reduction in vaccination dose. We will first engineer the DNA nanoparticles with different sizes and narrow distribution using the FNC method, and characterize their stability, surface properties, and ability to transfect DCs; then determine the effect of NP size on LN-draining efficiency and gene expression in DCs in different dLNs; and lastly demonstrate the robust immune responses elicited by LN-targeting NPs with LAMP/ZIKV DNA vaccine, and characterize the subtypes of anti-ZIKV response. This timely study will not only develop a more effective ZIKV vaccine and support further testing of the next generation of Zika vaccine, but also provide a potent DNA vaccine platform against other emerging pathogens."
"9264961","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over 5 million older Americans currently suffer from Alzheimer's disease and related dementias with 80% receiving care in the community by 15 million informal caregivers (CGs) providing unpaid care.1 Dementia is associated with high health care costs, long term care (LTC) placement, medical complications, reduced quality of life, and CG burden. Patient and family centric care models tailored to dementia that address the multidimensional aspects of dementia management, and link health and community care are understudied but may represent a promising mechanism to address the multiple and on-going needs of this growing population, reduce adverse outcomes such as premature LTC placement, and produce cost benefits. We propose a definitive Phase III efficacy trial to test Maximizing Independence at Home-Streamlined (MIND-S), a home- based, care coordination intervention for community-living PWD and their informal CGs that builds on pilot work. In a pilot trial, MIND was successfully implemented in a diverse sample of 303 community-living individuals with memory disorders and was found to be acceptable to CGs, led to delays in time to transition from home, improved PWD QOL, and CG time savings.73,78 We now propose a 24-month, prospective, single- blind, parallel group, RCT evaluating MIND-S in a cohort of 300 community-living PWD and their informal CGs in the Greater Baltimore area. Intervention dyads will receive 18 months of care coordination by an interdisciplinary team comprised of trained non-clinical community workers (Interventionists), a psychiatric nurse, and geriatric psychiatrist. The intervention involves 4 key components: identification of needs and individualized care planning (PWD and CG needs); dementia education and skill building; coordination, referral and linkage of services; and care monitoring. Aim 1: To determine the efficacy of MIND-S on time to long term care (LTC) placement or death at 18 months and 24 months (6 months post treatment). Aim 2: To estimate MIND-S cost and assess whether it results in net financial benefits by conducting a cost-offset analysis taking the societal perspective at 18 months and 24 months (6 months post treatment). Aim 3: To determine the efficacy of MIND-S on PWD unmet care needs, neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), and quality of life (QOL), and on CG unmet needs and burden at 18 and 24 months (6 months post treatment). Exploratory aims: To explore whether the moderators and mediators of the intervention's effect on time to LTC or death. This proposal brings together an internationally and nationally recognized group of researchers with complimentary expertise in community-based dementia care, clinical trials, health economics, and biostatistics. If proven efficacious and cost efficient, the MIND-S model has the potential to change how dementia care services are provided and coordinated at the community level and serve as a national model. It is responsive to the National Alzheimer's Plan Act (Public Law 111-375) calling for development and testing of new comprehensive models of dementia care."
"9326119","Project Summary: Over half of newly diagnosed cancer patients are over age 65, and the number of older adults with cancer is expected to grow as the population ages. Older adults with cancer are more likely to be undertreated and experience premature discontinuation of treatment than younger patients, often resulting in worse outcomes. Studies suggest that poor symptom management and inadequate social support may explain this suboptimal treatment of older cancer patients. Thus, efforts to better understand and address the palliative care needs of older adults with cancer are critically important. We propose to develop an outpatient geriatric care intervention focused on the unique palliative care needs of older adults with incurable gastrointestinal (GI) and lung cancers. GI and lung cancers are among the leading causes of cancer death in the geriatric cancer population, and patients with incurable GI and lung cancers experience high rates of both physical and psychological symptoms. We will first conduct qualitative interviews with oncology, geriatric and palliative care clinicians, followed by patients, to explore their perceptions of the necessary components of the intervention. By exploring the views of these key stakeholders, we seek to develop a transdisciplinary intervention tailored to the needs of older patients with incurable cancer. Notably, the intervention will comprehensively address the unique geriatric and palliative care needs of these patients. We will then conduct a pilot (n=50), randomized controlled trial (RCT) to demonstrate the feasibility of the geriatric care intervention versus usual care in patients age ?70 with newly diagnosed, incurable cancer. We will estimate the effect size of the intervention for quality of life, physical function, physical and psychological symptoms, cognition and geriatric impairments. The study will take place at Massachusetts General Hospital, drawing on the clinical and research expertise of the Cancer Center, Geriatric Medicine Unit, Palliative Care Department and the Department of Psychiatry's Behavioral Medicine Service. Primary mentorship will be provided by Jennifer Temel, MD, a nationally- recognized expert in the development and testing of supportive care interventions for patients with incurable cancers. Additional mentors include Lara Traeger PhD, Ardeshir Hashmi MD, Vicki Jackson MD, MPH, Supriya Mohile, MD, MS and William Dale, MD, PhD. This mentorship team of experts in geriatric oncology, palliative care, qualitative research methods and intervention development are committed to ensuring the success of the proposed research. The proposed study will not only further our understanding of the supportive care needs of older adults with cancer, but also develop a novel intervention to address these concerns and improve the quality of life of this patient population. Notably, the GEMSSTAR will provide vital support as I seek to become a leader in geriatric oncology research. My overarching goal is to become an independent investigator studying interventions to improve the supportive care provided to older adults with cancer. This grant will provide support for the mentorship, training and experience I need to establish a track record in aging research."
"9369929","PROJECT SUMMARY Priming of T-cell responses by dendritic cells (DCs) is an essential initiation step for the adaptive immune response. This process requires intimate cell-cell interactions at a site termed the immunological synapse (IS). Mounting evidence from a variety of sources indicates that this process involves mechanotransduction. Although events on the T cell side of the IS have been extensively studied, little is known about the DC side of the interface, apart from the fact that an intact DC actin cytoskeleton is required. We have found that DC maturation involves changes in cytoskeletal protein expression associated with altered biophysical properties of the cell cortex. Using atomic force microscopy (AFM), we found that cortical stiffness increases from 2kPa to 3.5kPa upon LPS-induced maturation, a large change in biophysical terms. Our preliminary data suggest that changes in the expression or activation state of several key actin regulatory molecules are responsible for regulating DC stiffness. Remarkably, when T cells are stimulated on substrates of different compliance, they exhibit a sharp threshold for activation over the range observed during DC maturation. Thus, we hypothesize that cytoskeletal changes associated with DC maturation alter the stiffness of the DC cortex, and that these events represent a previously unappreciated mechanism through which T cell priming is regulated. To test this hypothesis, we will carry out two specific aims: First, we will characterize the cytoskeletal changes that modulate DC stiffness during maturation. On the basis of preliminary studies using pharmacological inhibitors, we will focus on WASp, formins, cofilin and ERM proteins. Using DCs from knockout mice or WT DCs expressing shRNA or dominant mutants, we will block the expression or activity of candidate proteins and test the effect on cortical stiffness and T cell priming (using peptide loading to focus analysis on events at the IS). In addition, we will manipulate DC cortical stiffness in ways that do not occur naturally, and ask whether this affects T cell priming. Second, we will test T cell priming on substrates that vary in stiffness over the physiological range we have defined in DCs. Using hydrogels coated with T cell ligands, we will determine which T cell subsets are stiffness sensitive, and how stiffness affects proliferation and effector lineage development. We will determine the contribution of TCR, CD28, and LFA-1 to stiffness sensing, and ask how actin dynamics at the IS respond to changes in stiffness. Finally, we will characterize stiffness effects on Ca2+ signaling and key phosphorylation events, with particular emphasis on molecules known to participate in mechanotransduction. If successful, this exploratory project will show that regulated changes in the biophysical properties of the DC cortex function as a previously undiscovered mechanism through which DCs tune the T cell response - a basic feature of DC maturation to be considered along with upregulation of costimulatory molecules and cytokines. Moreover, it will provide a molecular foundation for understanding how T cells sense DC stiffness, guiding future investigation of the underlying mechanobiology. !"

"9275333","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) develop as a consequence to abnormal remodeling of the aortic extracellular matrix (ECM). TAA development is influenced by a series of interrelated mechanisms that disrupt ECM homeostasis through the stimulation of proteolytic pathways, such as the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and dysregulation of the production and deposition of ECM proteins. Importantly, these mechanisms are mediated in part through changes in the resident cellular constituents within the aortic wall. Numerous studies have demonstrated that aortic dilatation is accompanied by the apoptotic loss of smooth muscle cells, suggesting that the aortic fibroblast may be the key cellular mediator of ECM remodeling during aneurysm formation. Moreover, recent evidence from this laboratory suggests that aortic fibroblasts undergo a stable transformation to a myofibroblast phenotype, that is characterized by increased myosin staining (DDR2/Myh11) and enhanced production of both MMPs and ECM proteins. It is hypothesized that the transdifferentiation of fibroblasts is essential for TAA progression. However, the mediator(s) regulating this fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition during TAA development remain undefined. One upstream signaling protein capable of regulating the structure and composition of the aortic ECM, and known to play an important role in mediating the fibroblast-to- myofibroblast transformation, is transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?). TGF-? is a soluble peptide growth factor, produced by multiple cell types within the aortic wall, and is known to play a significant role in aortic root dilatation secondary to Marfan syndrome, but its involvement remains undefined in non-MFS etiologies of TAA. TGF-? is sequestered within the ECM, bound by latent TGF-? binding proteins. These latent complexes are proteolytic targets for key MMPs (MT1-MMP) that are induced during TAA development. Accordingly, using an established mouse model of TAA, and isolated primary aortic fibroblast cultures (normal and TAA), the role of fibroblast transdifferentiation in TAA development will be examined with the central hypothesis that MT1-MMP- dependent TGF-? signaling is essential for TAA development through the modulation of aortic fibroblast phenotype change. This hypothesis will be tested by demonstrating that selective targeting of fibroblast transdifferentiation can modulate TAA formation and progression, that increased TGF-? signaling during TAA development is a direct result of altered MT1-MMP-dependent release of TGF-? from latent ECM bound stores, and that indirect pharmacological inhibition of TGF-? signaling results in the attenuation of TAA development. The outcomes from this unified set of aims will establish a cause-effect relationship between MT1-MMP activation, TGF-? dependent myofibroblast differentiation, and TAA development."
"9275398","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Quinolones, such as ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin (Levaquin(R)), are the most efficacious and broad- spectrum oral antibacterials currently in clinical use. These drugs are used as front-line treatments for a wide variety of human infections caused by Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.  The cellular targets of quinolones are the bacterial type II topoisomerases, gyrase and topoisomerase IV. These closely related enzymes are essential to cell survival. Gyrase regulates levels of DNA under- and over- winding and alleviates torsional stress that accumulates ahead of DNA replication forks and transcription complexes. Topoisomerase IV alleviates torsional stress, removes knots and tangles from the genome, and is required for proper chromosomal partitioning. Both enzymes function by passing an intact double helix through a transient double-stranded break that they generate in a separate DNA segment. Quinolones kill bacteria by increasing levels of DNA strand breaks generated by gyrase and topoisomerase IV, effectively converting these enzymes into potent cellular toxins that fragment the genome. Both type II enzymes are physiological targets for quinolones, but their relative importance to drug action appears to be species- and drug-dependent.  There is a growing crisis in antibacterial resistance, and quinolone resistance is becoming prevalent. Initial quinolone resistance is most often associated with specific mutations in gyrase and/or topoisomerase IV. Resistance can range from <10- to >100-fold, depending on whether one or both enzymes are mutated. The most common resistance mutations occur at a serine residue originally described as Ser83 in the GyrA subunit of Escherichia coli gyrase and a glutamic/aspartic acid residue 4 amino acids downstream. Based on functional studies from the Osheroff laboratory and a published structure, these residues are proposed to anchor a water- metal ion bridge that serves as the primary conduit between quinolones and the type II enzymes.  Despite the wide clinical use of quinolones, relatively little is understood regarding their interactions with gyrase or topoisomerase IV. Although amino acid mutations in gyrase and topoisomerase IV that are associated with drug resistance have been documented in thousands of isolates, only a handful of studies have gone beyond identifying mutated residues and addressed the underlying biochemical basis for quinolone resistance. Clearly, there is an urgent need to develop more effective drugs that display activity against resistant strains. Therefore, to address this critical issue, the specific aims of this proposal are: 1) To determine the mechanistic basis for quinolone action and resistance. A variety of biochemical and biophysical approaches will be used. Studies will focus on elucidating quinolone-enzyme interactions and the role of the proposed water-metal ion bridge. 2) To determine the roles of gyrase and topoisomerase IV in mediating quinolone-induced toxicity. Relationships between quinolone potency, efficacy, and resistance in vitro and the relative importance of gyrase vs. topoisomerase IV in mediating drug-induced cell kill will be defined. We will determine physiological levels of quinolone-induced DNA cleavage mediated by both enzymes and the persistence of gyrase- and topoisomerase IV-DNA cleavage complexes in drug-treated cells. 3) To design novel drugs that overcome the most common quinolone resistance mutations in gyrase and topoisomerase IV. Studies will take great advan- tage of preliminary data and mechanistic (Aim 1), cellular (Aim 2), modeling, and competition studies. Our goal is to design drugs that do not rely on the water-metal ion bridge for their primary interaction with the bacterial type II enzymes and do not crossover into the human system. Three lead compounds have been identified.  The primary research models for this study will be gyrase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis and gyrase and topoisomerase IV from E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus and to a lesser extent, Bacillus anthracis. Proposed research benefits greatly from previous studies from the Osheroff laboratory on the mechanism of bacterial and eukaryotic type II topoisomerases and the interaction of these enzymes with quinolones and other drugs."
"9274905","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Almost 50% of the Veteran patient population will be over the age of 65 by the year 2020. Therefore, it is imperative that we better understand the mechanisms of diseases affecting our older Veterans. There is increasing evidence that prolonged low-grade inflammation, expressed by elevated levels of circulating proinflammatory cytokines, may play a role in many aging-related chronic diseases especially skeletal muscle insulin resistance and pancreatic B-cell dysfunction leading to type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular disease. There is also evidence that sex steroid hormones play a role in these metabolic disorders. One of the significant consequences of the age- associated decrease in testosterone levels in older men is an increase in central adiposity, which may be the source of adipose tissue-derived inflammatory cytokines, or adipokines. The current proposal will test the hypothesis that the aging associated decrease in testosterone levels in older men is associated with increased insulin resistance, due to an increase in adipocyte mediators of inflammation.  To test this hypothesis, using our currently established protocol, 60 healthy older Veterans will first undergo short-term medical androgen ablation and aromatase inhibition and be placed on transdermal testosterone and estrogen to establish uniform initial testosterone and estrogen levels. Subjects will then be randomized into one of 4 treatment groups for 6 weeks: 1) continuation of testosterone and estrogen; 2) continuation of testosterone only, without estrogen; 3) continuation of estrogen only, without testosterone; or 4) discontinuation of both testosterone and estrogen. Outcomes before and after 6 weeks will include: 1) circulating adipokines; 2)monocyte and adipose tissue RNA/protein expression of inflammatory markers; 3) precise measures of total, visceral, subcutaneous and ectopic skeletal muscle adiposity; and 4) insulin sensitivity. The specific aims will be 1) to define the specific individual effects of testosterone and estrogen on key serum and tissue adipokine levels in older men; 2) to determine the individual effects of testosterone and estrogen on total, subcutaneous and visceral adiposity, as well as ectopic lipid deposition in skeletal muscle; and 3) to examine the relationships between testosterone and estrogen induced changes in adipokine levels and total and regional adiposity and insulin sensitivity.  These studies will provide important new information regarding the basic cellular and molecular mechanisms of the effects of sex steroid hormones on adipose tissue function and inflammation in older men, and their relation to changes in insulin sensitivity. Novel information resulting from this study should lead to new prevention strategies, agents and interventions to decrease insulin resistance and metabolic risk in older Veterans, an outcome highly relevant to the VA patient care mission."
"9275430","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cutaneous melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, arises from neural crest derived melanocytes. Much progress has been made in delineating molecular events that initiate the cascade of malignant changes leading to metastatic melanoma. These advances have led to some remarkable improvements in treatment of melanoma. However, the notorious intrinsic resistance to conventional therapies and development of treatment resistance to targeted therapies continue to be vexing problems highlighting the need to explore additional avenues for preventing melanoma development and progression. In this context, the role for Notch signaling in melanoma remains to be fully understood and exploited. Notch signaling, an important cell signaling mechanism, is known to play a role in melanocyte development. However, molecular mechanisms and the specific roles Notch plays in melanoma development and progression are not completely understood.  Preliminary data obtained in my laboratory showed a possible biphasic role for Notch signaling in melanoma tumor progression. In skin resident benign neo-plastic melanocytes and early primary melanoma, a downregulation of Notch signaling and its effector HES1, a transcriptional repressor, allows elaboration of neuronal differentiation. This is indicated by the expression of a protein, MAP2 that is normally present only in terminally differentiated neurons that lack ability to divide. A retrospective survival analysis showed that patients whose primary skin tumors were MAP2-positive survived significantly longer without melanoma recurrence than those diagnosed with MAP2-negative melanoma. MAP2 is absent or found less frequently in metastatic melanoma. In agreement with its primary function of binding to and stabilizing microtubules, MAP2 alters the dynamic instability of microtubules and induces mitotic spindle defects in melanoma. Preliminary data also showed that molecular players that initiate the malignant changes in melanocytes also play a role in activation of this neuronal differentiation marker. Thus, activation of a neuron-specific gene in melanocytes at early stages of malignant transformation correlates with inhibition of proliferation in vitro and tumor growth and progression in vivo. Based on these data, we hypothesized that Notch signaling, has a dual or biphasic role in melanoma. First, Notch signaling is downregulated during early steps in malignant transformation by sustained oncogenic signaling to promote neuronal differentiation as a fail-safe mechanism against melanoma tumorigenesis, and additional genetic events such as loss of PTEN then lead to upregulation of Notch signaling to support melanoma tumor progression. To test this hypothesis, we will use a combination of in vitro and in vivo approaches to accomplish the following Aims:  In Aim 1, we will study mechanisms of transdifferentiation in melanocytes and patient-derived melanoma using primary melanocytes and a panel of well-characterized melanoma cell lines, we will investigate the molecular mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will investigate the role of Notch signaling and neuronal differentiation in melanomagenesis using metastatic melanoma cells with stable knockdown of HES1and/or treated with inhibitors of Notch signaling in immunocompromised mice, and a genetic cross between transgenic mice with inducible MPA2 expression in melanocytes and BrafCa/Pten-/- mice. In Aim 3, we will evaluate the prognostic significance of Notch in melanoma employing quantitative immunohistochemical method to analyze an in- house created melanoma tissue microarray consisting of 225 stage I-III primary melanoma specimens with complete clinical history.  The hypothesis on the dual role of Notch in transdifferentiation and use of combination of mouse genetic model and a fully annotated melanoma tissue microarray are the innovative aspects of the proposed research. Data obtained from these studies have the potential to uncover more reliable prognostic markers for melanoma aggressiveness and impact the management of aggressive cutaneous melanoma."
"9275366","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The exquisite specificity of antibody-antigen interactions is ideal for therapeutic applications, bt the therapeutic use of antibodies has been limited to extracellular targets because of limited access of antibodies into cells. We developed a cell-penetrating antibody, mAb 3E10, as an intracellular transporter to deliver antibodies into cells as bispecific single-chain Fv fragments (scFv). mAb 3E10 is unique in that it penetrates cells without apparent harm and has been administered to humans without evidence of toxicity. We chose Mdm2 as a target because Mdm2 is an important target in cancer therapy, and we selected mAb 3G5 to target the N-terminus of MDM2. Our long-term goal is to develop 3E10-3G5 bispecific scFv as a therapeutic for the treatment of cancer and extend the application of 3E10 to target intracellular sites that are currently considered undruggable with small molecules. The objective here in the pursuit of this goal is to establish proof-of-principle for targeting antibodies to intracellular targets by developing and evaluating 3E10-3G5 as a model system. Our central hypothesis is that 3E10-3G5 scFv will be therapeutically effective in many cancers, and it will synergize with conventional cancer therapies. The rationale for the proposed research is that intracellular antibodies can target intracellular epitopes that are undruggable and cannot be targeted with small molecules, and they have greater binding specificity than small molecules, thus eliminating off-target binding responsible for toxicity of therapy based on small molecule inhibitors. Specific aims: 1) Examine a broad spectrum of human tumor xenografts to determine which cancer cell types are responsive to 3E10-3G5 scFv, 2) Elucidate the p53-dependent and p53-independent mechanisms responsible for inhibiting growth of cancer cells responsive to 3E10-3G5 scFv, 3) Determine the clinical efficacy of 3E10-3G5 in combination with conventional chemotherapy in human tumor xenografts in vivo. The proposed research is significant because our intracellular transport system can be used to transport antibodies into cells to target epitopes on transcription factors and DNA repair proteins that cannot be targeted with small molecules, thus broadening the spectrum of potential intracellular targets for cancer therapy. The proposed research is innovative because it utilizes a novel cell-penetrating antibody that serves as a transport system to deliver antibodies directly into cells through an equilibrative nucleoside salvage pathway. Our laboratory is the only one to develop this technology, and we have demonstrated its feasibility and clinical efficacy in vitro and in vivo."
"9275450","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Future-oriented thoughts occupy a prominent position in spontaneous mental activity. They serve an important adaptive function, in that they enable us to represent multiple hypothetical outcomes and act in light of those anticipated outcomes. A future-oriented thinking style has been linked with general wellbeing and correlates with optimism and resilience. Despite the importance of future thinking to psychology and other domains where beliefs about future outcomes are central to behavior, such as health and economics, our understanding of the cognitive and neural bases of future thinking is still in its infancy. Neuroimaging findings over te past five years have shown that thinking about the future engages a core set of brain regions that have traditionally been associated with episodic remembering. Such findings suggest a direct link between the ability to remember the past and to envision the future. However, neuroimaging evidence is correlational in nature, and causal inferences can only be drawn from lesion studies. Further, despite the fact that every future simulation, just like every lived experience, falls somewhere along an affective continuum, little is known about the interplay of emotion and memory in future thinking. Given the powerful influences of emotion on memory, the intriguing possibility of similar influences of emotion on future thinking merits study. The current proposal provides the first comprehensive, theoretically motivated analysis of future thinking in patients with amnesia secondary to medial temporal lobe (MTL) lesions. The first part of the proposal draws on insights from neuroimaging studies regarding hippocampally-mediated mechanisms of future thinking to define the scope of the future-thinking impairment in MTL amnesia and to identify interventions that may ameliorate the impairment. The second part of the proposal examines the interplay of emotion and memory in future thinking by (a) examining how emotion modulates hippocampally-mediated processes underlying future thinking; and (b) exploring how memory impairment affects emotional biases that are typically evident in future thinking. Given the role of the amygdala in the emotional modulation of memory, we focus on a comparison of the performance of patients with MTL lesions limited to the hippocampal complex and patients whose lesions extend beyond the hippocampal complex to include the amygdala. In the third part of the proposal, we evaluate the adaptive value of memory for future-oriented behavior by examining conditions in which MTL amnesia impacts decision making. The studies comprising this proposal provide a principled way to gauge the scope of the future thinking impairment that results from MTL lesions and a theoretically based approach to remediation. They also provide the first systematic exploration of how the emotional attributes of future thought modulate the MTL-associated impairment in future thinking. Finally, by revealing the impact of the MTL-associated memory impairment on future-oriented behaviors, these studies will shed novel light on the adaptive function of memory. We anticipate that these findings will have important implications for understanding impairments in future-oriented thought and behavior in a variety of neurological and psychiatric populations. !"
"9275390","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN) is the dose-limiting toxicity for many commonly utilized classes of anti-cancer agents, and there are no currently available FDA-approved interventions to prevent CIPN. In animal models CIPN can be prevented by systemic administration of neurotrophic factors, but translating these findings into a clinical treatment has been limited by off-target effects that preclude systemic administration. Over the past decade we have addressed this issue by gene transfer using vectors created from replication incompetent herpes simplex virus (HSV) to achieve local release of peptides from dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and our HSV vector expressing preproenkephalin is now in a phase 2 clinical trial for treatment of intractable pain. To safely express neurotrophic factors n the peripheral nervous system for a condition that extends over a prolonged timeframe, it will be essential to be able to regulate transgene expression. Studies proposed in this application are designed to extend our previous work to determine whether regulated expression of either neurotrophin-3 (NT3) and/or interleukin-10 (IL10) from non-replicating HSV vectors can be used to prevent CIPN."
"9271223","Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), a disease characterized by rapid development of intestinal inflammation,  often resulting in gut necrosis, is a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. NEC  pathogenesis is poorly understood, and there are no diagnostic tests to predict which infants will develop  NEC; furthermore, there are no effective prevention strategies. Recent studies have identified red blood  cell (RBC) transfusion, a common therapy in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants, as an important  risk factor and potential causative factor in the development of transfusion-related NEC (TR-NEC),  defined as NEC developing within 48 hours of a RBC transfusion. However, biologic and clinical  determinants of RBC TR-NEC remain poorly understood.  Our proposed study will enroll 220 ELBW infants and be the first prospective, large, multicenter cohort  study to investigate the pathophysiologic mechanisms that underlie the development of NEC following  RBC transfusion. Our overarching hypothesis is that irradiation of RBC units followed by prolonged  storage perturbs RBC metabolism/function, leading to paradoxical microvascular vasoconstriction, tissue  hypoxia and TR-NEC in transfused infants with already impaired gut oxygenation due to significant  anemia. Our three specific aims will test key aspects of this hypothesis. This study will utilize innovative  methods to study TR-NEC, including metabolomics (Aims 1 and 2), near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS)  which is an in vivo non-invasive measure of mesenteric regional saturation of oxygen (MES-rSO2; Aims  1 and 3), and in vitro RBC functional studies (Aim 2). This proposed study will fill key knowledge gaps  regarding the effects of RBC storage time and irradiation on neonatal gut injury. Further, these data will  guide development of new interventions, such as using NIRS to identify susceptible infants, limiting IST  of stored RBC products, and using metabolite biomarkers to predict RBC safety.  This project addresses the P01 central theme since ELBW preterm infants are a population  vulnerable to the development of TR-NEC with antecedent RBC transfusion(s). This project interacts  with Projects 1, 3, and 4 by identifying metabolic biomarkers that are associated with adverse  transfusion events. Additionally Core A (regulatory approvals, sample repository), Core B  (metabolomics), and Core C (biostatistics) are utilized heavily in the proposed studies."
"9265372","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The rising global prevalence of Alzheimer disease (AD) has heightened the urgency to develop effective AD therapeutics. Despite extraordinary efforts, we have been less than successful to curb either the progression or initiation of AD through drug therapy. To do so, we need a stronger understanding of the fundamental elements of AD pathobiology. The multifactorial nature of AD pathogenesis is becoming increasing clear and thus we can benefit from a broad approach to understanding disease mechanisms for effective therapeutic targeting. Recent advances have revealed factors such as partial loss of presenilin function and non-cell autonomous interactions which may contribute to AD pathogenesis. For example, murine models in which both presenilin genes are absent in forebrain neurons develop AD-like neuropathological and clinical features including neurodegeneration. We have demonstrated that presenilin 2 (PSEN2) deficiency is associated with an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response in microglia and that the fAD associated PSEN2 N141I mutation leads to decreased gamma- secretase activity in microglia. We have also reported a novel AD associated PSEN2 mutation that leads to decreased c-terminus Presenilin 2 (PS2) protein, further supporting the hypothesis that PSEN2 loss of function contributes to AD. These findings in conjunction with the lack of success thus far of gamma secretase inhibitors in clinical trials and recent reports on partial loss of PSEN1 function associated with AD raise a critical question regarding the pathogenesis of AD. In addition to neuronal A?42 production what additional mechanisms are involved in AD pathogenesis? The dynamics and significance of A?42 production are being investigated; however, decreased CNS A? clearance itself has been implicated in AD. Microglia, are key mediators of A? clearance. Therefore altered microglia behavior, as we observed with PS2 deficiency, may play a critical non-cell autonomous role in AD pathogenesis. Taking all recently available data into consideration, we hypothesize that AD pathogenesis involves combinatorial dysfunction in multiple cell types and that PSEN2 fAD mutations contribute to disease through toxic-loss-of-function in addition to the previously described toxic-gain-of-function. The goal of our laboratory  is to study cell autonomous and non-cell autonomous mechanisms of neuronal injury in AD. We are pursuing an R01 funded project examining the impact of PSEN2 mutations on microglia and neuroinflammation as it relates to non-cell autonomous neurodegeneration in AD. To bolster the significance and human disease relevance of the R01 project, we are developing additional techniques in our research program with exciting potential to address these hypotheses. The use of patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) is an expedient approach to examine the molecular phenotype of specific mutations as well as their cell type specific effects. At the University of Washington (UW), we are uniquely positioned to address the questions posed above by employing several key resources. First, the UW Alzheimer Disease Research Center (ADRC) has banked fibroblasts from well-characterized fAD cohorts. Second, we have access to established facilities for the derivation and characterization of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) lines. We have created multiple iPSC lines which are being fully characterized molecularly, epigenetically and for capacity for teratoma formation among other crucial iPSC requirements. The impact of fAD mutations on iPSC derived glial cells and the effect of specific PSEN2 mutations on the biology of any neural cell type has not been reported. In this K02 proposal, I aim to collaborate with iPSC pioneers in the field with dual purpose to 1) develop a new skill set for my career development and 2) contribute unique information about PSEN2 fAD mutations and identify potential pathways where neuronal and glial cell processes may interact, leading to neurodegeneration. Thus, we propose the following experimental plan. We will investigate the cell type specific effects of two different PSEN2 mutations that cause fAD. We hypothesize that AD associated PSEN2 mutations lead to partial loss of PSEN2 function that will alter the behavior of neurons and microglia. To address this hypothesis we will: A) Generate, characterize and assess APP processing activity in iPSC lines from patient fibroblasts containing PS2 mutations. B) Differentiate iPSCs containing PSEN2 N141I or PSEN2 deletion mutation (PS2del) into neurons. Determine the effects of PS2 deletion on intrinsic electrophysiological properties, synaptic physiology and gamma secretase activity of these neurons. C) Differentiate the iPSC lines used in 1B into microglia and evaluate for pro-inflammatory cytokine release, phagocytosis and inflammatory pathway signaling. Next, we will study the non-cell autonomous impact of fAD PS2 mutations on the interaction between neurons and glia. We hypothesize that these two PS2 mutations contribute to AD through consequences of glial dysfunction leading to neuronal injury. By employing neuronal-glial co-cultures we will study neuronal processes in the presence of PS2 fAD mutation carrying microglia. We will: A) Measure wildtype neuronal synaptic physiology in the absence and presence of A?42 when cocultured with wildtype or PS2 fAD microglia. B) Assess neuronal susceptibility to neurotoxicity in the presence of wildtype or PS2 fAD microglia."
"9275357","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Interferon (IFN)a is an antiviral cytokine that has adverse effects on neuronal function. When IFNa  is used as a treatment for diseases such as viral hepatitis and cancer, it can cause cognitive dysfunction if it is given in sufficient quantities and for prolonged periods. IFNa is elevated in the central nervous system (CNS) of a number of diseases associated with cognitive dysfunction, most prominently in HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). There is abundant data both in animal studies and in vitro demonstrating that IFNa is associated with neuronal dysfunction.  IFNa is elevated in SCID mice with HIV encephalitis (HIVE) and is correlated with the degree of behavioral dysfunction exhibited during water radial arm maze (WRAM) testing. When HIVE mice are treated with neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to IFNa, behavioral abnormalities on WRAM testing and some aspects of HIVE histopathology are prevented or substantially reduced. To begin to understand the effects of IFNa on MAP2 expression and dendritic formation in neurons, an in vitro system using fetal rat neurons was used. These neuronal cultures reveal a dose dependent decrease in dendritic length and branching when exposed to IFNa. This effect is blocked by NAb to IFNa and partially ameliorated by NMDA antagonists.  In this competitive renewal it is proposed that in vivo studies initiated during the previous grant (see above) will be extended by treating HIVE mice with a novel IFNa blocker, B18R (NormferonTM-alpha). This agent is more practical than NAb to IFNa for moving into human trials, primarily because it is less immunogenic, among other potential advantages. It appears likely that B18R crosses the blood brain barrier and inhibits CNS IFNa during encephalitis. Studies initiated in the previous granting period included the determination of effectiveness using a current combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) regimen in treating HIVE mice. These studies will also be extended by combining B18R with this cART regimen to determine if the combination is more efficacious than either alone. Importantly, these studies using both the B18R plus the cART regimen should more closely simulate human conditions, where cART reduces viral load but does not prevent HAND; therefore it is hypothesized that the two together will reduce viral load and ameliorate behavioral abnormalities in mice..  Moreover, proposed in vitro studies will extend previous in vitro results by examining the effects of IFNa on neurons to further elucidate the mechanisms of IFNa neurotoxicity. It is assumed that neurotoxicity stems from IFNa receptor (IFNaR) engagement, although previous studies mentioned above indicate that NMDA receptors also play a role. Therefore in vitro studies will determine whether IFNaR engagement correlates with downstream IFNa signaling and dendritic abnormalities. In addition, pathways involved in dendritic formation will be investigated through gene array analysis in neurons after IFNa exposure. Identification of pathways involved in the disruption of dendritic formation will contribute to understanding the basic mechanisms of memory formation and could lead to better treatments of cognitive dysfunction."
"9275375","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most common cause of visual impairment of the elderly  in the United States. We have previously identified a genetic variant in the chromosome region of  HTRA1/ARMS2 was associated with major susceptibility to AMD. This disease genotype results in  increased expression of high temperature requirement factor A1 (HTRA1). In our previous funding  period, we systematically scanned all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) related to AMD and  investigated their regulation of expression of HTRA1 and ARMS2. Our functional study reveals loss of  HTRA1 leads to decreased retinal vascular development and significant down-regulation of vascular  endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene expression in HTRA1 knockout (htra1-/-) mice. Conversely, we  show Increased expression of HTRA1 in RPE leads to Bruch's membrane pathology and elevated  VEGF expression. We further revealed that the up-regulation of VEGF by HTRA1 is inversely  correlated to the down-regulation of a member of the TGF-b family, the growth differentiation factor 6  (GDF6). The long term objectives of this proposal are to characterize the normal function of HTRA1,  elucidate molecular mechanism by which HTRA1 contributes increased risk of AMD, and development  potential therapies. Our central hypothesis is that HTRA1 contributes to AMD risk by regulation of  vascular development, angiogenesis, TGF-b signaling, and extracellular matrix modeling. Guided by  this hypothesis, we propose to conduct the following specific aims.  Specific Aim 1: Generation of monoclonal antibodies to HTRA1 and investigating their  therapeutic potential by tissue specific delivery into the RPE cells. Increased HTRA1 expression  induced PCV and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy and photoreceptor degeneration. We will generate  monoclonal antibodies specifically bind to HTRA1. The selected antibody strains with the high affinity to  HTRA1 will be converted into a single chain format (scFv), which will be further evolved to maximize  binding specificity and affinity using a state-of-the-art novel protein in vitro evolution technology. We  will use a gene therapy strategy to deliver such optimized HTRA1 antibodies into RPE and test its effect  on inhibition in HTRA1 transgenic mice and a laser-CNV model.  Specific Aim 2: To determine the role of TGF-b signal pathway in retinal development and  pathology. We show that GDF6 significantly associated with AMD and demonstrated that the GDF6  AMD risk allele is associated with decreased expression of the GDF6 and increased expression of  HTRA1. We also showed that TGF-b receptor 1 (TGF-b R1) is associated with AMD. We will generate  conditional knockout mice which delete GDF6 and TGF-b R1 in either retina or RPE to examine the role  of TGF-b signal pathway in retinal development and pathogenic changes, including ophthalmoscopy,  histology, ERG, and expression profile, immunohistochemistry and choroidal neovascularization (CNV)  formation."

"9232137","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Patients with severely damaged auditory nerves cannot benefit from cochlear implants. The goal of this project is to accelerate the translation of silicon-based, multisite, penetrating microelectrode arrays to a cochlear nucleus auditory prosthesis. We have recently made significant technological advances with our devices in the cat model, which together with high-count cables and feedthroughs will provide a unique opportunity to develop arrays of multisite microelectrodes that are suitable for clinical use. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of interfacing a multisite microelectrode array with a lare number of microstimualting sites to an implantable pulse generator (IPG), in preparation for a subsequent clinical trial. Validation of the cochlear nucleus implant for clinical use will also advance other configurations of silicon- substrate multisite microelectrode arrays toward clinical use. These include the auditory nerve and the auditory midbrain (inferior colliculus), and perhaps even the primary auditory cortex. We are proposing to conduct appropriate tests under two ISO (International Organization for Standardization) guidelines: (1) ISO 10933 in Aim 1 to validate the biocompatibility of the electrode array and associated cables, and (2) ISO 14708 in Aim 2 for interfacing the array and cable to a neurostimulator. In Aim 2, we will develop the interface to an IPG, and determine the compliance of the system in-vitro per ISO 14708 which specifies requirements for reliable interfaces to neurostimulators. These tests are a critical majo step to optimizing our devices for a future investigational device exemption by the FDA. The successful outcome of the project will be the translation of a new generation of multisite, penetrating silicon microelectrode arrays that will be implanted in a human cochlear nucleus, allowing for unprecedented access to the tonotopic organization of the nucleus. Finally, these multisite silicon devices can be modified for other neurological conditions including spinal cord and deep brain stimulation."
"9268512","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. Because current treatments provide modest symptomatic relief and do not slow AD progression, a better understanding of molecular bases of AD pathology is needed. This proposal will identify and validate microRNAs (miRNAs) as a new class of drug targets. miRNAs are endogenous, short, non-coding RNAs that typically inhibit protein expression by interacting with specific recognition elements of target transcripts. AD is believed to result from overproduction of amyloid-ß peptide (Aß), derived from Aß precursor protein (APP), and dysregulation of proteins involved in Aß production (e.g. APP, ß-secretase/BACE1) contributes to excess Aß deposition. We have also recently found that miRNA can stimulate APP expression in interaction with iron homeostasis. We propose to study APP and BACE1 regulation by miRNA. We hypothesize specific miRNAs regulate endogenous levels of APP and BACE1, are dysfunctional in AD, and manipulation will reduce Aß. Specific Aim 1(SA1) will identify functional miRNA target sites in APP and BACE1 and validate miRNA post-transcriptional regulation of native APP and BACE1 expression. Rationale: Discover functional miRNA targets in UTRs of APP and BACE1 transcripts using. Endpoints are APP and BACE1 mRNA & proteins, and Aß peptides, which we predict to change with miRNA. Impact: Manipulation of miRNA regulation is a novel therapeutic approach and may be feasible for correcting gene dysregulation in AD. SA2 will test physiological interactions between miRNA validated in SA1 and their regulatory networks over APP and BACE1 expression. Rationale: Test other mechanisms of regulation likely linked to maintain homeostasis of APP, BACE1 and Aß. Identifying roles of miRNA in this network is vital to pharmacologically target miRNA-transcript interactions. Impact: Reveal novel mechanisms for miRNA function in AD. SA3 will assess effects of in vivo manipulation of validated miRNA in AD animal models. Rationale: Test our validated miRNAs as therapeutic targets in AD transgenic animals, including interaction with iron homeostasis, by inducing miRNA-dependent changes in translation. Impact: Validate specific miRNAs as drug targets in vivo and identify novel AD-related regulatory networks. SA4 will examine whether miRNAs implicated in regulatory control of gene products involved in Aß homeostasis are dysregulated in AD patients. Rationale: In SA1-3, we will identify pertinent miRNAs that modulate expression of gene products implicated in Aß production. If these miRNAs are also involved in AD pathology, we expect their regulation to vary in anatomical- and pathology-dependent patterns. Impact: Further demonstrate validity of miRNAs as therapeutic targets to treat AD-related dysregulation. Research dictated by our central hypothesis could cause a significant paradigm shift on the field by elucidating novel regulatory mechanisms and identifying specific miRNAs that regulate important gene products implicated in AD. Final impact will be in eventual use of these new drug targets to produce therapeutic agents to slow or halt progression in AD."
"9311659","ABSTRACT  Excision of introns from precursor messenger RNA by the spliceosome is a critical step in almost all human gene expression. This process is highly regulated, integrally linked with the transcription of genes and other processing events, such as polyadenylation and nucleotide modification.  The mechanism by which the spliceosome recognizes the exact sites for the chemical events and how the reactions are catalyzed are not well understood. The long-term goals of this project are to understand interactions and rearrangements between spliceosome components and the RNA ligands that are substrates for the catalytic reactions. Ample evidence argues for multiple rearrangements of factors and multiple recognition events at the branch site. Investigation of these events ? which are not understood mechanistically ? will elucidate interactions and rearrangements among core components and may serve as a paradigm for rearrangements in the spliceosome and in other RNP machines. This proposal focuses on mechanisms by which spliceosomal dynamics impact splicing fidelity.  Experiments will first investigate binding and positioning of the 3'SS-UAG onto the spliceosome. Binding of the spliceosome to the 3'SS is critical for intron definition, for spliceosome assembly, and for splicing catalysis. Yet, nothing is known of spliceosome?3'SS-UAG interaction, other than the early interaction with U2AF. Here we use an `orthogonal spliceosome' (second-copy, reverse-engineered, designer spliceosome) that we have developed in yeast, to identify both the 3'SS binding site for second-step catalysis and a `loading site' for 3'SS on the assembling spliceosome. Second, two large gaps in our understanding of RNA biology are the identification of RNAs between 50 and 200 nts, which are missing in almost all modern-day sequencing datasets, and the bioinformatic analysis of repetitive sequences ? the snRNAs represent both. We have identified novel U2 snRNA variants that are expressed differentially in cells, and we will investigate the components, function, and substrates of novel U2-variant spliceosomes."
"9308504","Project Summary: A patient currently considering epilepsy surgery receives counseling about his/her expected chances of seizure-freedom based on generic overall rates of success in large surgical cohorts. Answering the question of how ?a patient like me? will do after surgery essentially depends on the physician's interpretation of complex pre-surgical testing: in fact, there is no objective, reproducible, and validated method to comprehensively combine the results of the pre-surgical work-up into an individualized outcome prediction. This uncertainty delays the initiation of surgical work-ups in patients who may benefit from epilepsy surgery, and may lead to redundant, risky, and futile testing in others who may actually not be good surgical candidates. This is a multi- center project building on an already developed statistical model, adding information from the fundamental components of any pre-surgical evaluation, including EEG, brain imaging, and clinical characteristics to develop an enhanced online tool called the ?Epilepsy Surgery Nomogram? (ESN) allowing a tailored outcome prediction. Using the ESN, the physician treating a patient's epilepsy will be better able to assess the chances of seizure-freedom following epilepsy surgery, and will have a tool to assist decision-making by providing personalized and customized counseling. The goal will be to improve the care of patients with epilepsy by:1)- identifying surgical candidates earlier, and 2)- identifying complex cases needing a dedicated comprehensive epilepsy center more efficiently."

"9137619","Protocol Title: Phase 2 trial of Gamunex (Intravenous Gamma globulin) for Sickle Cell Acute Pain Principal Investigator: Deepa Manwani Co-Investigators: Paul S. Frenette, Patricia A. Shi, Hillel Cohen, Catherine Driscoll, Veronica Carullo ABSTRACT Sickle cell anemia is one of the most common hematologic diseases in the world. The most common clinical manifestation of this disease is the recurrence of vaso-occlusive episodes (?crises?) for which there is currently no therapy other than supportive care and analgesics. Studies using a mouse model of sickle cell disease (SCD) suggest that leukocytes (WBCs) that are adherent to the vessel wall of post-capillary and collecting venules play a key role in vascular occlusion by interacting with sickle eythrocytes (RBCs)1-3. In search for the molecular mechanisms responsible for these interactions, it was found that intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) had a profound effect on the interactions among RBCs, WBCs, and the endothelium, improved blood flow in venules of the cremaster muscle and, most importantly, impacted on the overall survival of sickle cell mice.4,5 A pilot phase I double blind placebo controlled randomized, dose escalation study demonstrated that while doses up to 800mg/kg can be safely administered to sickle cell disease patients during acute pain events, a 400mg/kg dose provided optimal biomarker and clinical efficacy with decreased infusion associated adverse events. We therefore want to evaluate intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) at the 400mg/kg dose in a phase II clinical study in sickle cell disease patients that are admitted to Montefiore Medical Center for vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC). Hypothesis:  1) IVIG at 400mg/kg is well tolerated by patients with sickle cell disease admitted  with VOC.  2) IVIG can be effective in ameliorating VOC in patients with sickle cell disease. Specific Aims:  1) To evaluate the effect of a single dose of 400mg/kg of IV Gamunex on time to  resolution of VOC in subjects 8-21years of age hospitalized for sickle cell VOC in  a randomized, double blind placebo controlled Phase 2 trial.  2) To further evaluate safety of a single dose of 400mg/kg of IV Gamunex in  subjects 8-21years of age hospitalized for sickle cell VOC  3) To evaluate biomarkers of adhesion and inflammation and secondary clinical end  points (e.g. total opioid use, length of hospitalization and change in LDH) in  subjects enrolled on this study)."
"9374590","ABSTRACT Alveolar macrophages (AMs) are central sentinels of the lung that function in pathogen clearance and initiation of inflammatory cascades. Molecular mechanism(s) coupling these two processes are not yet clear. Previous AM depletion studies show both beneficial and detrimental outcomes for pulmonary inflammation and injury, implying a more targeted approach is required for precise modulation of the AM behaviors. Our opportunity in fulfilling this unmet medical need is the identification of the role of TRIM72 in regulating AM phagocytosis and inflammatory signaling pathways. Our pull-down assay identified an interaction between TRIM72 and a novel phagocytic receptor and our data imply that TRIM72 may impact LPS sensing by TLR4. We hypothesize that TRIM72 shapes innate immunity of the lung by regulating CRIg phagocytosis and TLR4 signaling pathway. We aim to dissect the molecular mechanisms of such regulation in this exploratory grant in two specific aims: Aim 1: to delineate the mechanism(s) through which TRIM72 regulates pathogen clearance by AMs, and Aim 2: to explore the mechanism(s) of TRIM72 regulation on TLR4 and the effect of CRIg. Our results should lead to novel discovery on elucidating the role of AMs in pulmonary inflammation and injury and identify new targets for tailored modulation of AM function for the treatment of these lung diseases."
"9486775","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The water treatment product developed in this SBIR program will give more people the opportunity to live healthier lives and strengthen communities by increasing available water resources. The contamination of drinking water is an age-old problem. In recent decades, the pollution of ground and drinking water by organic chemicals has attracted increasing attention all over the world as man-made toxins (pharmaceuticals, plasticizers, pesticides, disinfectant by-products, etc.) continue to enter the worlds' drinking water reservoirs via wastewater, agricultural runoff, storm water, air pollution, and polluted soil. Exposure to these toxins through drinking water is leading to chronic, complex diseases; the burden of which falls primarily on socioeconomically disadvantaged communities. Removal of organic chemicals from drinking water is imperative to protect the health of the world's populations. Traditional adsorption technologies do not have the structural sophistication to allow for the simultaneous removal of multiple complex chemicals. Other purification technologies (i.e. reverse osmosis membranes and hydroxyl radicals) have failed to provide a simple and cost-effective means to remove the wide spectrum of organic chemicals now found in drinking water supplies. What's missing from the $3B US residential treatment market is a simple and cost effective POU product for the wide spectrum of difficult to remove and highly toxic trace organic chemicals. Through this SBIR project, Chemica aims to bring a timely new tool to the field of water treatment/purification that specifically targets difficult to remove contaminants in an easy-to-use and affordable manner. This will be achieved through applying Chemica's proprietary surface modification techniques to a robust carbon fiber substrate. Chemica's novel fiber is easily scalable and can be tailored to meet users' specific needs. The goal for this SBIR program is to produce a prototype modular cartridge containing a robust adsorbent with 5x faster adsorption rates over existing adsorbents and lower lifecycle costs compared to alternative water purification technologies.

The objective of the Yale Program is to develop a cadre of physician scientists and PhD investigators with expertise in geriatric clinical epidemiology and/or translational aging research who will be equipped to address the myriad of unanswered questions concerning the diagnosis, etiology, treatment, management, prevention, and prognosis of the health problems experienced by the ever increasing number of older persons. We will accomplish this objective by providing highly qualified physicians, who are already well trained in geriatrics and/or subspecialties with age-related relevance, and outstanding PhD-trained investigators with 2 to 3 years of rigorous research training. Our trainees will develop skills in each of 8 essential areas: 1) formulation of significant and focused research questions and hypotheses; 2) design of observational and/or experimental studies to address focused research questions; 3) techniques for successful execution of specific study designs; 4) project and/or laboratory management; 5) critical analysis of the scientific literature, including research methods and data quality; 6) interpretation of findings; 7) verbal and written communication of scientific methods and findings; and 8) development and implementation of strategies for research support. These skills will be developed through a training experience that includes both didactic and experiential components. The didactic curriculum includes courses offered through the Clinical Scholars Program, Investigative Medicine Program and School of Public Health, coupled with several high quality aging- specific training venues at Yale and off site. The central component of the Yale Program is a mentored research experience, which includes structured meetings with Program Faculty in geriatrics/gerontology and at least one supervised research project tailored to the trainee's experiences and interests, with the goal of producing one or more first-authored, peer-reviewed publications and a grant application to support further research. The Yale Program has successfully recruited and retained a full complement of outstanding trainees during each of the first 9 years, and has successfully placed many of its graduates in tenure-track, research- intensive positions at top-tier academic institutions. For the next five years, we request full funding for the five postdoctoral positions that had been previously approved."
"9351701","PROJECT SUMMARY: This proposal for a program project grant (PPG) seeks to understand the mechanism of action of the novel pro- longevity hormone FGF21 by assembling a diverse and complementary group of investigators at Yale University and UT Southwestern. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) is a member of the endocrine FGF subfamily that acts through a cell surface receptor composed of FGF receptors in complex with the obligate co- receptor ?Klotho. FGF21 is a unique metabolic hormone as it is secreted in blood from liver in response to starvation and nutrient deprivation to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and to maintain energy balance. Recent studies from our PPG team have demonstrated that overexpression of FGF21 in mice extends lifespan, improves insulin-sensitivity and may promote immune function. Based on these data, the central hypothesis of this program project is that FGF21 is a key driver of CNS-adipose tissue-immune system interactions that coordinately promote a prolongevity molecular program. Overall objective of this project is to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying FGF21's anti-aging effects and to leverage these insights towards inhibiting aging-related chronic diseases. Given the diverse backgrounds and skills of the research team, we can use state-of-the-art mouse models and methodology to assess the effects of FGF21 on multiple organ systems at different levels ranging from the molecular to the behavioral. We propose four projects to pursue the aims of this PPG: Project 1 under the leadership of Drs. Steven Kliewer and David Mangelsdorf will investigate the impact of FGF21 on growth hormone action, healthspan and lifespan. Project 2 under the leadership of Dr. Vishwa Deep Dixit will study the impact of FGF21-mediated immune-metabolic interactions on immune- senescence. The project 3 will be headed by Dr. Philipp Scherer to investigate the Impact of FGF21- adiponectin-ceramide axis on aging and Project 4 under the leadership of Dr. Tamas Horvath will study the impact of FGF21 on CNS and hypothalamic control of aging. The Core A will facilitate communications between projects and provide support for data analyses and Core B will provide centralized facility for analysis of aging and healthspan in mice. The PPG team will explore the novel hypothesis that FGF21 acts through multiple tissues to increase healthspan and lifespan."
"9347154","ABSTRACT Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is an important cause of dementia and contributes to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most common inherited cause of SVD. Clinical features of CADASIL include dementia, recurrent stroke, and psychiatric disorders. Understanding the pathology of CADASIL may lead to strategies to treat SVD. CADASIL is caused by cysteine-altering mutations in NOTCH3, suggesting that redox alteration of this protein could contribute to SVD. Altered forms of NOTCH3 may lead to massive protein accumulation, cell separation, and smooth muscle cell death seen in CADASIL. Specific cell loss, protein conformational alterations, and protein accumulation seen in CADASIL suggest similarities to degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. In preliminary studies, we identify a novel post- translationally generated fragment of NOTCH3, called NTF (NOTCH3 N-terminal fragment) from human CADASIL tissues. We show that NTF is capable of trans- reducing NOTCH3 into a pathological form of NOTCH3 with multiple reduced cysteines (mrc-N3). Moreover, NTF causes both acute and chronic changes in the brains of mice which are not normally susceptible to SVD. Enzymatic liberation of NTF occurs in cells, and we identify a potential protease that is increased in CADASIL tissues. In Aim 1, we will define the features of NTF that promote NOTCH3 protein reduction to mrc-N3. In Aim 2, we will we explore the extent of protein reduction mediated by NTF. And in Aim 3, we will determine whether a brain protease that is enriched in CADASIL participates in NTF generation. These experiments explore a novel, self-perpetuating molecular mechanism by which pathological proteins are produced in the human brain. Information generated by this project could improve current translational models of SVD and enable progress in the discovery of therapeutic targets."
"9220696","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The ultimate goal of this study is to define pharmacological interventions that impact the inflammatory state in the cigarette smoke exposed lung. The immune response in the lung is composed of tissue-specific responses often to environmental agents that require the coordinated response by multiple immune and non-immune cells. When this becomes dysregulated, then pathologies related to excessive pro-inflammatory responses or fibrosis can result. The VA patient population is particularly at risk because of the disproportionate number of individuals who use cigarettes. In the lung a major target of nicotine is the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) alpha7 (?. This receptor has an exceptionally high permeability to calcium that alone can modulate intracellular signaling pathways regulating of transcription factors, cytokines and chemokines. This project will use newly developed mouse models designed specifically to study the ?inflammatory interaction with cigarette smoke (CS) in the mouse lung and will focus on identification of specific cellular signaling mechanisms controlling this response in alveolar and interstitial macrophages, as well as non-hematopoietic cells of the lung. The overall proposal hypothesis is: Modulation of the nicotinic ?calcium current modifies tissue-specific intracellular signaling pathways in the lung in response to cigarette smoke. We will test this hypothesis in 3 Specific Aims: In Aim 1 the hypothesis is: Susceptibility to lung damage and compartmentalized inflammatory control is determined by cell-specific ?expression. The preliminary data reveal that alveolar macrophages (AMs), granulocytes, and interstitial cells (hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic) express ? and the expression level in individual animals corresponds to the magnitude of the inflammatory response. The results will for the first time allow us to define how CSand the nicotine in CS, acts through ?to govern the inflammatory response by cells as they transition from a normal to a pro-inflammatory environment. In Aim 2 the hypothesis is: Calcium signaling through the ?receptor activates cell signaling pathways that control the magnitude of the pro-inflammatory response. Newly developed mouse models that specifically restrict ?calcium channel permeability will be used to define transcriptional and proteomic impacts of this restricted signaling on the nicotine:CS inflammatory response. Finally in Aim3 the hypothesis tested is: The ?calcium mediated signaling pathway(s) contribute to expression of M-CSF and GM-CSF by both lung macrophages and alveolar epithelial cells. We have already found evidence of perturbation of the CSF-signaling system controlled by the ?calcium signaling pathway. We will build upon this preliminary finding and apply our new findings to test the use of potential therapeutic interventions to manipulate the cellular responses dysregulated by CS and the nicotine: ?nteraction to restore a more normal response. At the conclusion of this project we will offer novel insights into the mechanisms controlling the impact of CS on the lung and how the susceptibility to subsequent pathologies may be approached to impact upon this important VA patient issue."
"9270606","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The plasmalemmal serotonin transporter (SERT) terminates serotonergic neurotransmission and thus plays a critical role in shaping the duration and magnitude of synaptic signaling. It works by coupling preexisting ion gradients to the thermodynamically unfavorable movement of serotonin from the synapse to neuronal and glial cytoplasms. This molecular machine has garnered significant clinical attention because its dysfunction has been implicated in multiple debilitating neuropsychiatric diseases such as depression, autism, obsessive- compulsive disorder, and generalized anxiety. Furthermore, it is the target of numerous psychoactive agents such as antidepressants, cocaine, and the amphetamine derivative ecstasy. Despite such clinical and pharmacological significance, atomic-level detail into the mechanism of substrate translocation, inhibition, and regulation has remained elusive. Two goals of this proposal include 1) solving the structure of a SERT in complex with substrates, ions, and inhibitors; and 2) probing the conformational dynamics of these interactions via hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS). Structure-based hypotheses will subsequently be tested with a combination of site-directed mutagenesis, cysteine crosslinking, transient and steady-state flux kinetics, dissociation/association binding kinetics, X-ray crystallography, and HDX-MS. Success will permit further investigation into specific antagonist binding sites and perhaps into the molecular basis for drug resistance, thereby paving the way for rational drug design efforts. When eventually coupled with in vivo work beyond the scope of this proposal, SERT structure/function studies may also shed light on the molecular underpinnings of disease-associated polymorphisms. Achieving any of one of these objectives would likely have significant impact in both the laboratory and the clinic."
"9275389","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Recent studies led by the PI demonstrated that activation of PTH receptor signaling in osteocytes is sufficient to increase bone mass and the rate of remodeling, two recognized actions of PTH on the skeleton; positioning osteocytes as crucial target cells of the hormone. The long term goal of this research is to determine the contribution of osteocytes to the regulation of skeletal homeostasis. The specific goal of this proposal is to reveal the mechanisms by which osteocytes induce bone resorption in response to PTH. Mice treated with PTH or expressing a constitutively active PTH receptor in osteocytes exhibit increased osteoclasts and elevated bone resorption. Conversely, mice lacking the PTH receptor in osteocytes exhibit decreased bone resorption. PTH-induced resorption is due to upregulation of the RANKL gene and requires extracellular matrix degradation by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Although it is recognized that the pro-osteoclastogenic action of PTH is mediated by cells of the osteoblastic lineage, the precise stage of differentiation of the PTH target cell remains unknown. Recent evidence indicates that osteocytes are an important source of RANKL; and that they secrete MMP13, which might facilitate osteoclast recruitment and resorption, and express membrane-bound MMP14 (or MT1-MMP), which remodels the pericellular matrix thus maintaining the osteocyte canalicular network and also induces RANKL shedding. Based on this evidence and findings showing that the expression of RANKL, MMP13 and MMP14 is elevated by activation of PTH receptor signaling in osteocytes, we hypothesize that direct effects of PTH on osteocytes increase RANKL and MMPs, which in turn act as osteocyte-derived factors to increase osteoclast formation and activity, and bone resorption. This hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims that combine in vivo and in vitro approaches and use novel genetically modified mice and murine and human osteocytic cells and murine primary osteocytes. Aim 1 will examine the contribution of membrane-bound and soluble RANKL to resorption induced by PTHR1 activation in osteocytes. Aim 2 will determine the contribution of osteocyte-derived MMPs to PTH-induced resorption. Successful completion of the proposed studies will positively impact basic bone biology and pathophysiology by advancing our understanding of the mechanisms by which PTH receptor signaling in osteocytes regulates the function of the cells that remodel bone, osteoclasts and osteoblasts, in health and disease."
"9259453","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As a result of the RV144 trial and numerous recent studies, heterologous prime-boost HIV vaccine strategies have emerged as the leading approach to elicit immune responses that could protect against HIV infection. The molecular basis of the heterologous approach over homologous approaches is not well understood, however. In particular, immune responses to vector or DNA priming immunizations that are then amplified by protein boost immunization are complex and obscure. In this proposal, we will perform experiments that may clarify unsuspected, fundamental aspects of the immune responses to the prime that are amplified by the protein boost. To test this, we will control for many factors in a heterologous prime-boost experiment, varying only the conformational B-cell epitopes between prime and boost. Our innovative hypothesis is that the conformation of B-cell epitopes in the prime influences those self-same epitopes in the boost. Rabbits will be immunized with an array of DNA primes constructed to express or exclude specific immunogenic HIV variable loop epitopes and then boosted with an immunofocused protein immunogen that exclusively bears those epitopes. We expect to observe whether the expression of a conformational epitope in the prime amplifies or retards elicitation of neutralizin antibodies from that self-same epitope provided on the protein boost. The results will clearly provide the first consistent rationale for selecting or designing HIV env genes for use in priming immunizations. This exploratory R21 project will thus form the foundation for a unique long-term research program into the molecular details of the interaction between priming and boosting immunizations in a heterologous prime-boost strategy. These details may be crucial for designing an efficacious HIV vaccine."
"9344525","The fidelity of messenger RNA precursor (pre-mRNA) splicing is critical for safeguarding the neuronal transcriptional program, and splicing factors have been linked to both nervous system development and degeneration. Pre-mRNA splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, a dynamic and complex ribonucleoprotein machine including approximately 200 core proteins, 5 small nuclear RNAs, and an array of accessory factors. In compelling preliminary studies, we implicate spliceosomal disruptions in Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis through integrative analyses of human clinicopathologic cohorts and experimentation in the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. In human brains with AD neuropathology, numerous components of the spliceosomal U1 small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle (snRNP) are abnormally enriched within insoluble cortical fractions. We further demonstrate widespread intron retention within mRNA transcripts consistent with spliceosome dysfunction resulting in global splicing failure. Immunohistochemistry in postmortem brain tissue reveals cytoplasmic mislocalization of U1 snRNP proteins in neurons as well as co-aggregation with Tau neurofibrillary tangles, one of the defining pathologies of AD. In Drosophila, transgenic expression of human Tau induces age-dependent aberrant localization and sharply reduced U1 snRNP component levels, concomitant with increased intron retention of candidate transcripts encoding essential synaptic proteins. Loss- or gain-of-function in spliceosomal genes enhance and suppress Tau-induced neurodegeneration, and mutation of SmB, encoding a core spliceosomal protein, causes progressive neurodegenerative changes independent of Tau. We hypothesize that disruptions in the splicing machinery and resulting derangements of the neuronal transcriptome mediate Tau-induced neurodegeneration in AD. We will first (AIM 1) quantify U1, other spliceosomal snRNPs, and related factors in the insoluble proteome of 500 human brain autopsy samples, and in a subset, we will additionally characterize potential neuronal nuclear depletion. The most promising results will be confirmed by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence studies of postmortem tissue. Next (AIM 2), leveraging the rapid and powerful genetics available in Drosophila, we will elucidate Tau-spliceosome interactions and their impact on neurodegeneration. A combination of biochemistry and confocal microscopy will be utilized to examine for altered solubility and aggregation of spliceosomal factors. Lastly (AIM 3), we will integrate available human cortical transcriptomic data with a new reference transcriptome generated from the brains of Tau transgenic flies in order to pinpoint splicing errors with causal roles in neurodegeneration. IMPACT: By integrating proteomic and transcriptomic studies in human brains with targeted functional studies in Drosophila we will elucidate how Tau neuropathologic burden leads to disruptions in spliceosomal proteins and dissect the resulting causal chain leading to neurodegeneration."
"9256456","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Oral thrush, a mucosal biofilm infection, continues to afflict an unacceptably high percentage of immunocompromised individuals, particularly neonates and patients on immunosuppressive medications. Although C. albicans is the primary etiologic pathogen, the microbial ecology of this infection is complex since it contains members of the endogenous bacterial flora. Candida forms mixed biofilms with streptococci in the oral cavities of humans but the role of these biofilms during the course of mucosa-associated or invasive infections is unknown. In the proposed work C. albicans and S. oralis will be used as model organisms to study the mucosal disease-promoting interactions of the non-pathogenic oral bacterial flora with opportunistic fungi that have established virulence, such as C. albicans. Our studies rely upon a systematic and comprehensive approach to characterize both host- and pathogen-mediated aspects of the pathogenesis of mixed opportunistic mucosal infections. We hypothesize that enhanced proinflammatory host responses and increased Candida virulence mediate a pathogenic synergy of these microorganisms in the oral and esophageal mucosa. In aim I we will characterize the influence of streptococci on the TLR2/4-mediated host response to mixed infection and test the hypothesis that the exaggerated proinflammatory and neutrophilic response to mixed Candida-streptococcal biofilms leads to increased pathology. In aim II we will examine mechanisms of mixed microbial community assembly and virulence. The role of streptococcal glucosyltransferases, major enzymes contributing to the extracellular slime that promotes biofilms, will be examined. In C. albicans we will identify the transcription factor(s) tht control dual community assembly. We will also test the hypothesis that S. oralis increases the virulence of C. albicans by modulating several Rim101-dependent virulence genes, important in oral mucosal invasion, using a mouse oral co-infection model. An understanding of the effects of oral streptococci on Candida virulence and the mucosal inflammatory response will provide important novel insights into the pathogenesis of fungal infection within the oral and esophageal host niche. More importantly, the discovery of a synergistic role for oral bacteria in pathogenesis may have important clinical implications in the treatment of oral thrush which is currently based solely on antifungals."
"9265381","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic disease represents a major global challenge to individuals and the health care system. The knowledge and skills necessary for translation of chronic disease epidemiology into practice and policy are rapidly changing. The next generation of researchers must be equipped to capitalize on the development of implementation science in a population context, on new data sources and linkages; rapid advances in computational tools; and innovations in statistical methods, with an emphasis on translation and implementation. This training program will address the concerns of the NIH Biomedical Research and Workforce working Group by providing training applicable to multiple research related career pathways. The program (Translational Epidemiology - Training for Research on Aging and Chronic disease: TE-TRAC) focuses on chronic diseases of aging, including Alzheimer's disease and related disorders, cancer, musculoskeletal, and cardiometabolic disorders. Four unique strengths of our program are: 1) integration of population and implementation science research; 2) didactic and experiential training using implementation science to prevent and delay incidence and progression of major aging related chronic conditions; 3) emphasis on rigorous methods for longitudinal research in complex data sets; 4) use of multi-level data linkages, including genomics, clinical information drawn from electronic medical records, and environmental or social profiles. The implementation science and translational component of our program is unique among training programs that focus on chronic disease epidemiology. Formal training will be combined with experiential rotations in clinical practice, health policy, and publc health practice. The program will include key activities incorporating coursework, biweekly interdisciplinary seminars, and mentoring by renowned chronic disease researchers. The program emphasizes development of knowledge and skills related to research design, analysis, and translation, providing trainees the tools to excel as independent researchers in a new era of chronic disease epidemiology. Faculty mentors reflect the depth and breadth of the UCSF community in both clinical and population research domains. This program will be led by the department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics. We will train both pre- and post-doctoral trainees. Over five years, we will train a total of 16 scientists. Our program will train a new generation of chronic disease epidemiologists, equipped to take advantage of emerging tools/resources to develop highly effective approaches to promote healthy aging. Trainees will take leadership positions in academia, policy, communications, private industry and the health research sector."
"9463032","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this T32 program is to train new independent investigators who will utilize contemporary genetic and molecular genetic techniques to investigate the underlying mechanisms of aging. The rationale for the focus of our program can be succinctly summarized as follows: 1) The genetic approach to the analysis of the biology and pathobiology of aging has special merit that, by definition, it deals with primary, constitutional, heritable, controls of gene action and thus can inform us as to fundamental mechanisms. 2) The tools for the molecular genetic approach to the pathobiology of aging are becoming increasingly rich and diverse. We thus believe that this focus for gerontological research will be applied with increasing frequency and success. While this may seem obvious given today's prominence of molecular genetics, until recently the field of gerontology did not have so rich a historical background in use of genetic approaches. Thus, we believe there is a need for more investigators who are trained in the principles and methods of genetic analysis and in gerontology. Such training is the primary goal of this program. The program currently supports 8 pre- and 8 post-doctoral trainees, and we request to sustain these numbers. We provide continuity of training by typically providing support for 3-4 (pre-doc) or 2-3 (post-doc) years. Predoctoral candidates ordinarily begin in their 2nd year of graduate training and post-docs in their 1st year of post-graduate training. The relevance of this program to public health is rooted in fact that age is the primary risk factor for disease in our population: diseases associated with aging are the chief health burden to our society and the primary cause of reduced quality of life. An increased understanding of the genetic mechanisms responsible for the processes that contribute to the burden of disease in aging can have a great positive impact on our society. We are training bright, new scientists who are highly motivated to work to increase this understanding."
"9317177","Abstract Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is an autoimmune disease that causes organ damage, leading to significant morbidity and mortality. SLE is characterized by the generation of autoantibodies, which bind to an individual?s own tissues to induce inflammation and organ damage. An important mechanism for SLE-induced inflammation is activation of the complement cascade. The complement system is an important part of the immune system, which is well-designed eliminate pathogens with the help of antibodies and other immune components. In SLE though, autoantibodies that have bound to patients? organs activated complement to generate damaging inflammatory responses. Currently, clinicians assess complement activation through the complement components C3 and C4 in serum. As the complement cascade is activated, both C3 and C4 become attached to the surfaces of pathogens and cells and serum C3 and C4 levels decrease as a result. In SLE, since complement activation occurs during flares, C3 and C4 levels should also decrease in flares. During systemic inflammation though, the liver produces both C3 and C4. Thus, during SLE flares, there is both consumption (due to their activation on cell surfaces) and production (due to inflammation-induced liver production) of C3 and C4. This leads to the underdetection of SLE flares. Complement activation generates numerous split products (or fragments) that are found on the surface of cells and interact with numerous complement receptors (both stimulatory and regulatory). Given the central role of complement activation in SLE, identifying the array of complement signatures on immune cells and blood will likely generate important observations regarding SLE pathophysiology. Indeed, the value of complement split products have just started to be realized, as increased erythrocyte and platelet bound C4d can provide utility in the diagnosis of SLE. Nevertheless, a comprehensive, qualitative assessment of the complement fragment deposition on immune cells from patient with various states of SLE has yet to be performed. Here, we hypothesize identifying complement signatures on immune cells using mass cytometry and blood complement split products will provide invaluable insight in the role of complement activation on SLE. We have two aims to test this hypothesis: 1) Evaluate the complement split product iC3b as a dramatically improved biomarker of SLE disease activity, and 2) Fully delineate the complement signatures found on immune cells from patients with SLE. Two recent technological improvements have made evaluating these Aims possible: 1) Development of an investigational medical device that rapidly determines blood iC3b and C3 levels without artefactual elevation of iC3b; and 2) Highly multiplexed phenotyping tools for immune cells such as mass cytometry has emerged as an innovative approach to analyze complex multicellular systems. The device that measures iC3b and C3 does so within 20 minutes, and our preliminary data demonstrate a strong correlation between iC3b and C3 levels to SLE disease activity. Applying MC to the study of complement signatures on immune cells in SLE will provide a level of detail and quantification that has not been possible. Thus, rather than evaluating an incomplete profile of complement proteins, we have the potential to quantify the levels and types of complement fragments, complement receptors, and membrane regulators on multiple cell types at the single cell level. This proposal will help establish the role of iC3b and iC3b/C3 ratios as a promising approach to assessing SLE disease activity, and significantly improve our understanding of how cell surface complement activation signatures on immune cells drive pathophysiology in SLE."
"9269956","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): My career goal is to become an independent investigator whose work improves conversations between clinicians and older patients with advanced heart failure (HF) and their caregivers. This application proposes a five-year curriculum and research plan designed to facilitate my development to an independent investigator in patient-oriented aging research. During the five years of the award, I will expand my research training and experience through mentored research, formal coursework and self-directed learning activities and develop independence through leadership and networking opportunities. The work proposed in this application involves studying goals of care discussions (GOCD) in older adults with advanced HF. As one of the leading causes of death, hospitalization, readmission and Medicare costs, HF is associated with poor health-related quality of life, significant psychological distress and increased health care spending for patients and their caregivers. The complex and changing trajectory of advanced HF along with the available life-sustaining therapies makes decision-making more complex in older adults as compared to other serious illnesses. Recent data in advanced cancer patients demonstrate that GOCD result in improved patient and caregiver outcomes. Unlike cancer, HF patients have highly variable prognoses, invasive potential treatments associated with major lifestyle changes, and unpredictable symptom crises, which make it difficult to extrapolate findings from cancer to HF. This proposal aims to address this gap. We hypothesize that improved GOCD will result in improved patient outcomes (receipt of treatments aligned with preferences, better quality of life, less depression and anxiety and decreased utilization) and caregiver outcomes (less depression, anxiety and caregiver burden, and improved satisfaction) as compared to patients who do not have GOCD. The aims of these projects are: (SA1) to identify barriers and facilitators to GOCD in older adults with advanced HF and to identify patient and caregiver health-related outcomes associated with GOCD; (SA2) to develop and refine HF Connect, a HF- specific GOCD training module, to meet the unique needs of these patients and caregivers; and (SA3) to conduct a pilot RCT of PREPARE + HF Connect to determine feasibility of enrollment, efficacy to increase GOCD and advanced care planning behaviors, and satisfaction with the tailored module. To achieve the first aim, I will analyze a multicenter cohort of advanced HF patients and their caregivers to identify the factors that predict GOCD and outcomes of these conversations. Next, I will interview patient/caregiver dyads to identify barriers and facilitatorsof GOCDs. Using SA1 data, I will develop HF Connect and use cognitive interviews with patients, caregivers and clinicians to refine it (SA 2). Finally, I will conduct a small RCT of HF Connect (SA3) to determine its feasibility and efficacy. These studies will generate data that will allow m to secure R01-level funding to test HF Connect in a multicenter RCT. The proposed research and career development plan are initial steps toward improving the care of older adults with advanced HF and their caregivers."
"9309758","Project Summary Most cellular processes in both the embryo and the adult are controlled by either differential expression or modification of regulatory proteins. We will develop proteomic tools to study quantitatively the effect of protein expression levels and post-translational modification on key signaling pathways in cells, and probe the complex behavior of these pathways in vertebrate embryonic development. Our premise is that highly reliable and very accurate quantitative profiling of protein levels and phosphorylation along with proper mathematical analysis will lead to insights into how signaling pathways communicate information and enable cells to make decisions on a cellular and tissue level. Phosphorylation is thought to be the major regulatory modification of proteins. At least half of all mammalian proteins are phosphorylated, yet for most phospho-sites we do not know which kinase is responsible for the phosphorylation, and hence how the target protein is regulated. We propose to dramatically advance this situation via a systems biology framework for studying phosphorylation cascades in mammalian cells in culture and in early vertebrate embryonic development, using Xenopus laevis embryos as a model system. We have shown how manipulation of kinase activity, with poly-specific kinase inhibitors, can identify the relationship between a phenotype and a specific kinase. By measuring phosphorylation sites quantitatively by MS (using each individual phosphosite as its own phenotype) we plan to provide a kinase- substrate map at a genome scale for both human and Xenopus, and use this to connect kinase activity to cellular phenotype. Our team is comprised of a close and well established collaboration between an expert embryologist/cell biologist/biochemist (Kirschner), an expert in systematic analysis and statistical inference (Peshkin) and an expert in proteomic mass spectrometry (Gygi). Our recently developed methods will allow us to reach unprecedented depth of quantification of proteins and protein post-translational modifications. In this grant we will develop further innovations in experimental design, analytical improvements and improvements in MS. The large size of Xenopus embryos permits organism-level studies of such sensitivity that they can be used on a relatively small number of experimentally manipulated embryos. Our efforts will produce systems- level knowledge of the dynamic protein states in cells and in cell populations in early vertebrate development. The resulting data sets and methods should be a powerful resource for vertebrate embryology and could be informative for heritable defects in human embryos. Many embryonic pathways, such as MAPkinase, Wnt, and hedgehog, are also very important in childhood development, tissue and cell turnover in adults, regenerative medicine, and diseases of the immune system and cancer. As many of these pathways and kinase relationships seem conserved across stages of development and across vertebrate species, there is promise of rapid transfer from model system to human patients. In particular we expect that our approach will also serve to facilitate systems-level pharmacology approaches to therapy."
"9454975","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Each of the billions of neurons in the human brain can have up to 10,000 synapses. By establishing a dynamic network of synaptic connections, the brain is able to attain the level of functional complexity that underlies human behavior. The efficiency of signal transmission at synapses is constantly being adapted in response to experience. This synaptic plasticity is critical for the fine-tuning of brain development as well a higher brain function such as learning and memory. The plasticity of synapses is modulated and maintained by processes that are sensitive to neuronal activity and astrocyte function. It is now clear that many neurological and psychiatric diseases result from defects in synaptic transmission and plasticity. Thus, understanding the mechanisms regulating synaptic transmission in the brain is critical for the development of therapeutic treatments for these diseases. The Conte Center will take several approaches to investigate the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in the regulation of plasticity at the excitatory synapses. Richard Huganir will be examining the dynamics of receptor trafficking during synaptic plasticity in vivo i real time using two-photon microscopy. Sol Snyder will be analyzing how gaseous transmitters like NO and H2S modify AMPA receptor function and synaptic plasticity. David Ginty and Alex Kolodkin will be examining how the Sema3F-Npn-2/PlexinA3 signaling pathway regulates synaptic structure and function and AMPA receptor trafficking. Paul Worley will be analyzing how the Oral and STIM1 proteins control intracellular calcium stores and regulate synaptic plasticity in neurons and astrocytes. Dwight Bergles will be studying calcium signaling in astrocytes and how astrocytic signaling can regulate synaptic plasticity. David Linden will be examining the modulation of calcium transients in mossy fiber nerve terminals in the cerebellum and the effects of behavioral experience on presynaptic function using in vivo imaging techniques. All of these projects center on the synapse and address how presynaptic, postsynaptic and astrocytic mechanisms converge on the synapse to sculpt its morphology and function. Understanding these basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission and plasticity will provide insight into normal and abnormal brain function."
"9387868","Molecular Basis for the Reciprocal Regulation of P. aeruginosa Virulence Factors  by the Signaling Kinase RetS Abstract  The nosocomial pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa causes acute and persistent, chronic infections using distinct virulence mechanisms. The sensor signaling kinase RetS is a major player in regulating these virulence mechanisms by inhibiting the signaling kinase GacS. The unique molecular mechanism underlying this inhibition has not been determined. Our preliminary data refute the original hypothesis that RetS interferes with GacS homo-dimerization. Here we propose to test an alternative model wherein RetS directly blocks the active and phosphorylation sites of GacS. The second part of the proposed work seeks to determine how this inhibition is relieved when the bacterium enters biofilm mode to cause an expression of entirely different set of virulence factors. We hypothesize that binding of the exopolysaccharide PSL to the sensory domain of RetS causes RetS autophosphorylation, which in turn triggers the release of GacS. Structural studies and a series of in vitro and in vivo assays are proposed to address these important biological questions. In addition, the use of the NarX sensory domain to regulate the kinase activity of RetS constitutes an important extension of previous applications. We are controlling an enzyme that does not have a HAMP domain normally required for NarX signaling. If our approach is successful it could be applied to studies of many more orphan signaling kinases."
"9272405","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): North Dakota is a state with a large land mass and a small, widely dispersed rural population. These characteristics motivated the ND INBRE to focus narrowly and aggressively on providing opportunities for the State's under-served students to participate in undergraduate and K-12 activities that would stimulate interest in joining the Nation's health professional pipeline. To date, the ND INBRE has formed effective and productive partnerships with all the state-supported four year primarily undergraduate institutions (PUIs) and all Tribal Colleges (TCUs) located within the borders of ND. In addition, the ND INBRE provides registration for all junior and senior high schools as encouragement for their students to participate in the regional, state, and national Science and Engineering Fair program. These partnerships are enhanced by successful efforts of the ND INBRE to improve and provide infrastructure to the research intensive universities (RlUs) and the PUI and TCU partners. These efforts will be continued in the current funding cycle with the additional participation of our community colleges in the summer undergraduate research program. The emphasis on undergraduate research will continue as the ND INBRE will fund 7 Research Development Grants at the 4 PUI institutions, 5 Student Powered Pilot Grants at the 5 Tribal Colleges, and 50 Summer Undergraduate Summer Research Fellowships primarily at the RIU institutions. The Transfer Stars program will encourage American Indian students graduating from 2 yr TCUs to complete their baccalaureate degrees and the Science and Engineering Fair program will encourage undergraduate enrollment in STEM programs at all ND institutions of higher learning. Following the award of the PUI and TCU research programs, competitive support for mentors and core infrastructure will be provided to the RIU institutions. The ND INBRE proposes to continue its outstanding performance in serving North Dakota's development of the next generation of biomedical research scientists and health professionals."
"9249928","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In vitro manipulation of cell fate, either through nuclear reprogramming or differentiation, remains to be an imprecise and inefficient process. Improving the accuracy and efficiency of in vitro cell fate conversion is of great interest to regenerative medicine. In order to gain a better control of cell fate conversion, it is important t identify the key genes or molecular pathways that drive individual cells to the desirable lineage, and to contrast them with the activities of the genes or pathways in the cells at the undesirable states. This will generate a short list of candidate genes/pathways that can be intervened for a more precise cell fate conversion. For this purpose, it is crucial to align the full transcriptome information of single cells along the time axis, and to connect the molecular signatures to the cellular phenotypes at the later stages. In this project, we will develop strategies based on cell lineage tracing and single-cell full transcriptome sequencing, and will apply it to the investigatin of the transcriptional regulation underlying cell dedifferentiation using novel models of human cells dedifferentiation with clear implications for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases. The first aim involves establishing a technical platform for single cell lineage tracing based on stochastic fluorescent labeling, single- cell isolation and transcriptome analysis. In the second aim we will investigate two cell-fate conversion procedures based on the concept of partial de-differentiation and re-differentiation."
"9353266","The United States has the highest rate of incarceration in the world. There are over 1,821 state and federal prisons housing over 2.3 million prisoners in the United States. The demographics of the prison population are shifting. Longer sentences and constrained options for early release compound this trend. The older adult segment of prison populations has more than tripled since 1990. The health status of aging inmates does not mirror the free-world population. In fact, prisoners typically present with health issues common to free citizens who are 10-15 years their senior. Prisoners are wards of that state, that is, the system is responsible for providing for not only custody and control of offenders, but also their care. Collectively, these trends have had a profound impact on prison systems: U.S. prisons are facing sharply increased demands in caring for aged and dying inmates. In response to this need, Phase I project Enhancing Care for the Aged and Dying in Prisons (ECAD-P) demonstrated that (1) there is a need and interest for products such as ECAD-P (i.e., corrections administrators and staff are interested in EOL care training); (2) trainings should be short, intensive, engaging, interactive, and contextually sensitive to the specific environment; and (3) an interactive, media-rich prototype with high acceptability and usability could be developed. The specification document and commercialization plan indicate it is possible to develop a full-scale ECAD-P learning system in Phase II and market potential exists. The technological innovation proposed for the ECAD-P project is well-suited to the targeted market. Technical merit, feasibility, and market potential of the ECAD-P Learning System were demonstrated in the Phase I project. The purpose of this Phase II application is to continue research and development of the ECAD-P learning system with an emphasis on developing a scalable unit for commercialization and testing scale-up in a larger number of more diverse contexts. More specifically, the aims of ECAD-P Phase II are to 1) Develop a full scale media-rich interactive computer-based learning system consisting of 6 modules addressing EOL and geriatric care issues in prisons; 2) Conduct in-person usability testing of the full scale ECAD-P Learning System in state and federal prisons to evaluate the user interface, ease of use, and perceived barriers in order to optimize the scalable unit for broader dissemination; and 3) Test scale-up of the full scale ECAD-P Learning System in 12 federal (n=6) and state (n=6) prisons across the nation to evaluate outcomes, usage patterns, and commercialization opportunities. Continued research and development will permit the refinement the scalable unit for commercialization. Expanded testing of the learning system will establish the effectiveness of the learning system and will provide critical insights relevant to dissemination of the commercial product."
"9211998","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           SUMMARY  Alcoholic fatty liver disease (ALD) is one of the primary causes of chronic liver diseases in the United States. In particular, ALD is becoming a prevalent health issue among veterans due to an increase in obesity, diabetes, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and drug abuse in conjunction with alcohol consumption. Disturbance of circadian rhythmicity is a risk factor for the development of liver and metabolic diseases. However, the association between the liver circadian clock and ALD remains an intriguing but unexplored research area. In addition, the most advanced analytical tools, such as transcriptomics (RNA- seq) and metabolomics (GC/MS), have not been well utilized to study ALD.  Nuclear receptors are key liaisons between the molecular clock machinery and metabolic diseases. My laboratory has pioneered major discoveries in the in vivo function of small heterodimer partner (SHP, Nrob2) in hepatic bile acid and lipid metabolism. The proposed study is based on our newly discovered role of SHP in integrating the circadian clock, metabolic network, and the ER stress signaling in the liver.  The overall objective is to establish an integrated molecular circadian network in alcohol mediated ER stress response and steatosis. The central hypothesis is that ethanol-binge alters rhythmic SHP expression in the liver, which in turn modulates Npas2 and the downstream targets in the ER stress signaling and lipogenesis pathways. Specifically, we will elucidate how alcohol, SHP and Npas2 coordinately control CHOP and SREBP1c gene transcription, protein stability, and activity, and establish the modulation by alcohol of the entie liver transcriptome and metabolome. Aim #1: To elucidate a SHP and alcohol mediated molecular circadian pathway that controls ER stress signaling; Aim #2: To determine the effect of liver specific Npas2 knockdown on the ER stress response and steatosis mediated by SHP and ethanol-binge; and Aim #3: To establish hepatic circadian transcriptome and metabolome networks interlocked by SHP and ethanol-binge. In addition to our unique in vivo mouse (SHP-/-) and in vitro cell models, new liver Npas2 knockdown mice will be generated and employed for the study. Our approach makes full use of molecular biology, systems biology, and genome wide high throughput analysis (RNA-seq and GC/MS) to address an important scientific question that is directly relevant to the health of veterans.  This study is innovative both conceptually and in the implementation of experimental approaches. The planned experimental strategies are comprehensive, yet feasible. This project will uncover for the first time a novel interplay between alcohol and the liver circadian clock to control the ER stress response and hepatic lipid metabolism. The discoveries made from this study are highly likely to enable substantial advances in ALD research, making this project of high clinical significance and translational value."
"9275451","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         PTSD is a disabling condition consequent to trauma exposure. Recent evidence demonstrates PTSD secondary to combat exposure prospectively increases risk of early incident cardiovascular disease (CVD), with a meta-analyses we have recently completed revealing that PTSD is associated with a hazard ratio of 1.34 for incident CHD or CHD-specific mortality. The rate of PTSD among Veterans who have served during Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom, and New Dawn (OIF/OEF/OND) is more than double that seen in the non-veteran population and consistent with that previously seen among Vietnam era veterans. It is essential for purposes of risk stratification, risk reduction, and health services planning that we establisha more complete understanding of the illness burden associated with military service, and develop PTSD associated risk markers that predict early onset of CVD. Endothelial dysfunction is the earliest indicator of risk for incident CVD. In a pilot series with 23 OIF/OEF/OND veterans we have found that, compared to individuals without any symptoms of PTSD, those diagnosed with PTSD secondary to military service demonstrate significant impairment in endothelial function and that even those with sub-syndromal PTSD symptoms demonstrate impairment relative to those without symptoms. The Specific Aim of this proposed study is therefore to examine endothelial (dys) function as a promising mechanistic link between PTSD and risk for incident CVD. OIF/OEF veterans with a range of PTSD symptom severity (N=300) will complete our laboratory protocol that includes assessment of the endothelial response during standard hyperemic probe and during emotional stress, administered under controlled conditions, with the majority (N=230) repeating this protocol approximately 1 year late. Assessment of autonomic and HPA axis activity, and of contributors to vascular homeostasis (e.g., endothelin-1) will be accomplished during the protocol. We hypothesize that: 1) a diagnosis of PTSD will be associated with endothelial dysfunction; we will explore (1a) whether there is a dose response relationship such that, as severity of PTSD symptoms increase we observe greater endothelial dysfunction.; 2) A change in PTSD symptom severity from time 1 to time 2, will be associated with a concomitant change in the endothelial response to both hyperemic and emotional challenge. We will also explore the association of endothelial (dys) function during emotional stress with markers of sympathetic, parasympathetic, and HPA axis activity and with associated contributors to vascular homeostasis."
"9267404","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K99/R00 application provides career development training and a research plan to further the understanding of glial responses in white matter in the context of Alzheimer's disease (AD). The hypothesis to be tested is that a progressive loss of myelin integrity occurs in AD, activating microglia towards a proinflammatory feed-forward loop, which mediates hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule-associated protein tau and traditional AD pathology: neuritic plaques (NP) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). Conventionally considered a disease of the CNS gray matter, AD also has pronounced and progressive deterioration of cerebral white matter. Recent evidence suggests that changes in myelin integrity could be an early factor driving AD pathology, through stimulation of inflammatory microglia activation and subsequent axonal damage. Extensive work has been done to understand the glial response in AD gray matter yet very little is known about microglia activation in AD white matter, despite the fact that we and others have found a more robust activation of microglia and inflammatory response in AD white matter compared to gray matter. No studies have systematically and quantitatively examined myelin changes and inflammatory profiles as a function of disease progression. Our project will fill this gap by using human autopsy tissue and a mouse model that exhibits loss of myelin integrity to test our hypothesis. Our specific aims are: 1) Quantify the relationship between myelin integrity, microglia activation, proinflammatory cytokine levels, and traditional measures of AD burden (NPs and NFTs) in the white matter of autopsy samples; 2) Determine if loss of myelin integrity, induced by mutation in PLP, in hTau mice will accelerate hyper-phosphorylated tau pathology, and if this pathology can be rescued by suppressing the chronic neuroinflammation using a glia cytokine inhibitor. This project takes advantage of a strong scientific environment and extensive resources at the University of Kentucky, including the Alzheimer's Disease Center, clinically well-characterized autopsy cases that span the disease pathology continuum, and renowned scientific expertise of an enthusiastic and committed mentoring team. A comprehensive training and career development plan has been developed for the K99 phase that includes further scientific training in oligodendrocyte/myelin biology and human neuropathology; formal coursework and participation in local, national and international scientific meetings; evaluative meetings with th mentoring team; and activities designed to improve communication, writing, teaching, and management skills. Overall, there is an outstanding intellectual environment and access to relevant expertise in the applicant's project area, multiple opportunities for career growth, and substantial institutional commitment. This rich and supportive environment will enable a highly promising young scientist to further develop his research expertise, pursue his structured training and career development plan, and launch his career as an independent academic investigator."
"9275308","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): As the baby boomers grow into older adulthood, the number of Americans aged 65+ rises 175% over the next twenty years when older adults will comprise ~20% of the population by the year 2030. As such, understanding the psychological and neural mechanisms supporting their emotional health and well-being is of the utmost importance. Happily, while cognitive abilities decline, older adults report more positive emotion in their daily lives and preferentially attend to and remember positive stimuli and events. Exactly why older adults exhibit these positivity biases is not yet clear, however. Among the possible reasons, how older adults regulate their emotion has been advanced as a potentially key factor in need of further investigation. Evidence suggests that older adults have chronically activated goals to regulate their emotion and effectively use strategies that influence the situations in which they place themselves, how they attend to them, and how their emotions manifest in overt behavior. However, one can't - and perhaps shouldn't - always try to avoid, modify, ignore or suppress expressive responses to the stressful health/mortality-related situations that become frequent in older age. Another regulatory option would be to use reappraisal, a cognitive strategy whereby changing one's interpretation of events changes one's emotional responses to them. Reappraisal is among the most effective and beneficial regulatory strategies for maintaining mental, physical and social health. Unfortunately, it isn't yet clear whether older adults are adept at using reappraisal, and what psychological and neural mechanisms determine their level of reappraisal skill. Of the few studies focusing on reappraisal in aging, some suggest impairment and others do not. Here we use fMRI to systematically examine whether, when and why older adults are effective at reappraisal. As such, this proposal responds directly to FOA PAR- 11-337's's call for applications that examine social, affective and cognitive behaviors of relevance to aging at the behavioral, psychological and neurobiological levels. Guided by a model of the neural systems supporting effective reappraisal in young adults, we will test hypotheses about the contexts where reappraisal ability could be impaired - or intact - in aging. We hypothesize that the extent to which an older adult can effectively reappraise depends on two kinds of factors, each a focus of one of our Specific Aims. Under Aim 1 we will conduct two experiments examining the extent to which older adults ability to reappraise depends on specific cognitive processes involved in the reappraisal strategies/tactics that are deployed. Under Aim 2 we will conduct two more experiments asking how older adults ability to reappraise depends on their goals to decrease or increase emotion, and whether their chronic regulatory goals lead them to effectively initiate regulation on their own. Together, these studies could have important implications for understanding both normal and abnormal emotional health in older age and foster development of interventions that enhance well- being and the ability to cope with the stress associated with the physical and cognitive decline of older age."
"9267089","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is an application for an Independent Scientist Award (K02) to the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Dan Nicholson, Ph.D. is an Assistant Professor in his sixth year as a faculty member in the Department of Neurological Sciences at Rush University Medical Center. Throughout his career, Dr. Nicholson has established a strong record of publications, including in his recent years as an independent investigator. He has also been successful in obtaining peer-reviewed funding from both federal and non-federal sources. Since joining Rush in 2009, Dr. Nicholson has leveraged his research training and developed a powerful technique called proteomic recon- structive microscopy, with which he is examining age-related hippocampal dysfunction and Alzheimer's dis- ease (AD)-linked channelopathies. However, increasing administrative and teaching duties hamper Dr. Nichol- son's research progress and potential, such that he is able to devote only ~50% of his time on research into the proteomic/integrative degradation of hippocampal neurons in aging and AD. This K02 award would relieve Dr. Nicholson of some of these restrictions and allow his research career to enter the next phase via (1) tutorial training in computational neurobiology and constructing morphologically realistic computational models of neurons; (2) tutorial training in two-photon laser scanning microscopy Ca2+-imaging of hippocampal dendrites; (3) applying next-generation proteomic imaging methods to hippocampal neurons, thereby enabling him to build both morphologically and proteomically realistic computational models of hippocampal neurons from rodents and human AD cases and their non-demented matched controls; (4) enabling him and his laboratory to generate sufficient data for grant applications including a new R01 and a smaller grant to the NIA; (5) enabling him to spend more time mentoring and interacting with his two graduate students and three postdoctoral fellows; and (6) engaging collaborators from outside the field of hippocampal neurobiology to build proteomically and morphologically realistic computational models of neurons from other brain regions vulnerable to aging, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders. The resource stability and protected time resulting from this K02 award would ultimately support several new projects exploring the signaling networks comprising voltage- and calcium-signaling interactomes in neuronal dendrites, with a particular focus on how they change during chronological aging and AD pathogenesis. Thus, the proposed experiments in this K02 application have broad significance and will have a substantial impact on Dr. Nicholson's research career via (i) the provision of enhanced research skills and knowledge complementary to his extant expertise; (ii) identifying new potential drug targets to treat AD; (iii) being the first to construct morphologically and proteomically realistic computational models of hippocampal neurons in the human brain; and (iv) unveiling the interaction of ion channels that drive aberrant neuronal signaling in ADTg mice, which will steer interpretation of the functional consequences of AD-linked changes in the single-dendrite proteome in human neurons."
"9269904","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)      Krabbe leukodystrophy (KD) (purported incidence 1:250,000) is an autosomal recessive disease due to loss of function mutations in the lysosomal enzyme Galactosylceramidase (GalC). One consequence of GalC loss of function is accumulation of the metabolic byproduct and toxin, psychosine (PSY) in the nervous system. The most common form of KD is the devastating early infantile type (EIKD), with onset of symptoms of disease in the first six months of life and death within 2-3 years of symptom onset. Newborn screening (NBS) for KD has been available for 9 years in New York State (NYS), 3 years in Missouri and will soon be available in New Jersey, Kentucky and Illinois. NBS and early diagnosis are critical for efficacious treatment of KD because the sole treatment available, pooled cord blood transplantation (CBT), is more effective when started pre-symptomatically and as early in life as possible. Accurate identification of imminent EIKD is also particularly important because the preparatory ablative regimen for CBT is associated with 20% mortality in the first year of life. Unfortunately, the current NYSNBS diagnostic paradigm for EIKD is imperfect, despite comprising DNA diagnosis, GALC enzyme levels, neurological exam, MRI scan of brain and electrophysiological exams. We hypothesize that two tests that can be determined rapidly on NBS blood spots, psychosine levels and GalC enzyme activities, will better predict KD. To test this hypothesis, we will measure PSY levels on bloodspots of patients in the Worldwide Registry of KD (WWR) at the Hunter James Kelly Research Institute HJKRI, and on bloodspots from new NYS-NBS positive babies (GalC levels known), as well as on controls. Using bivariate analysis of Galc and PSY, we will develop a new paradigm aimed at early and accurate prediction of EIKD. If this hypothesis is proven correct, the resulting change in the NYS-NBS algorithm will improve the speed, the sensitivity and the specificity of diagnosis and prognosis of KD, and thereby the efficacy of CBT. It will also provide a better template for a diagnostic algorithm useful for other  NBS diseases where early diagnosis renders treatment more efficacious."
"9271867","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized by the abundance of intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles and the extracellular deposition of the A? peptide (hereafter referred to as A?) into amyloid. In AD brains, the A? undergoes a conversion (monomer ? aggregate) and eventually precipitates as ?-sheet like structures that have been linked to neuronal death. The chemical mechanisms associated with these conversions remains largely unknown. Due to its high propensity to aggregate, the A? is extremely difficult to handle in the laboratory. Despite these difficulties, our research group was one of the first to perform solution NMR studies of the A?, which along with subsequent work from other labs established that the A? adopts a predominantly random, unfolded structure in aqueous solution at neutral pH. A major advantage of the NMR approach is that it can provide atomic level aspects of the structures and dynamics in solution that are not available with other low-resolution techniques. In this application, we will take the next important and novel step, and will use NMR to study the structural ensembles of the A? peptide inside living eukaryotic cells. This work will establish whether or not the A? structures in vitro are the same as those in living cells in vivo. This is extremely important, in that the A? is an intrinsically disordered protein, which is a major clas of proteins that have a very flexible three- dimensional structure and are particularly sensitive t environmental perturbations, and that the complex, crowded environment of the cell could potentially alter the structure and function. We will perform two Specific Aims and attempt to determine the intracellular structure and dynamics in living cells using an array of NMR experiments. We will also explore the interactions between the A? and mitochondria. Furthermore, the classical view is that the A? is deposited extracellularly, although new data from transgenic mice and human patients demonstrates that the A? can likewise accumulate intraneuronally and contribute to AD progression, further emphasizing the importance of in-cell NMR studies."
"9236052","Abstract Hospice care is conceptualized as quality compassionate care for people facing a life-limiting illness, with services that cover clinical care, pain management, and emotional and spiritual support tailored to patients' and families' needs and preferences. Family members, spouses, friends or others who assume the unpaid or informal caregiving role are essential to the delivery of hospice services; however, stress and caregiver burden can negatively affect caregivers' morbidity and mortality. The emotional needs of individuals caring for dying persons at home are not well attended, and interventions aiming to provide support to hospice caregivers are notably lacking. Our team recently completed a randomized clinical trial (Grant Nr. R01NR012213) with 514 hospice caregivers to test a problem-solving therapy (PST) intervention we tailored specifically for the hospice setting, entitled PISCES (Problem-solving Intervention to Support Caregivers in End of Life care Settings). Our findings demonstrate that the PISCES intervention when delivered face to face was effective leading to statistically significant decrease in anxiety and increase in quality of life when compared to the other groups (video group and attention control). An additional lesson learned from our RCT study is that caregivers wanted to focus not only on specific problems or challenges, but also on recognizing the positive aspects of caregiving. This approach of positive reappraisal has been found to enhance problem solving interventions in other settings. The specific aims of this renewal application are: 1) to compare the effectiveness of the PISCES intervention when delivered face to face and when delivered in a hybrid platform (with the first session in person and remaining sessions via video) to hospice caregivers; 2) to compare the effectiveness of the PISCES intervention to the refined PISCES intervention (PISCESplus) that integrates positive reappraisal elements; 3) to assess caregivers' perceptions of and satisfaction with the PISCESplus intervention; and 4) to conduct a cost analysis of the three intervention groups."
"9380500","Epithelial cells use cell-autonomous defense mechanisms to eliminate intracellular pathogens. These defense mechanisms are often activated or augmented by the cytokine Interferon-gamma (IFN?). We recently discovered that IFN?-primed mouse cells employ ubiquitin systems to mark Chlamydia-containing vacuoles (?inclusions?) for destruction. We reported that a subset of IFN?-inducible Immunity Related GTPases (IRGs) ? the so-called GKS proteins ? bind to inclusions, recruit ubiquitin E3 ligases and thereby promote the decoration of inclusions with ubiquitin. Ubiquitin-marked inclusions are subsequently destroyed and intracellular Chlamydia eliminated by the murine host cell. Our preliminary data show that IFN?-primed human cells also deposit ubiquitin on inclusions. Therefore, both humans and mice evolved IFN?-inducible ubiquitination pathways that target inclusions. However, our data indicate that mouse and human IFN?-inducible ubiquitination pathways are mechanistically distinct: while GKS proteins are essential for inclusion ubiquitination in mouse cells, GKS protein-encoding genes are absent from the human genome. We have further shown that the mouse-adapted pathogen Chlamydia muridarum can block the function of GKS proteins and is therefore resistant to ubiquitination in mouse cells but is susceptible to inclusion ubiquitination in human cells. The situation is reversed for the human-adapted pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis: we found that C. trachomatis inclusions label ubiquitin-positive in IFN?-primed mouse cells but remain largely devoid of ubiquitin in IFN?-primed human cells. These results show that C. trachomatis is uniquely adapted to its human host and has evolved mechanisms to avoid a human-specific ubiquitin-mediated response. The goal of this proposal is twofold: in Aim1 we will characterize this newly discovered IFN?-inducible human defense pathway and identify human factors critical for inclusion ubiquitination. To be able to monitor a successful human host response, we will infect human cells with the mouse pathogen C. muridarum. We will employ customized siRNA and CRISPR/Cas libraries to identify human genes responsible for the attachment of ubiquitin to inclusions. In Aim2 we will seek to identify C. trachomatis anti-immune factors that interfere with IFN?-induced induced ubiquitination of inclusions in human cells. We will use an arrayed and validated C. trachomatis mutant library to screen for C. trachomatis mutants that are susceptible to inclusion ubiquitination in human cells. Knowledge gained from this proposal will open up avenues for the development of novel therapeutics that aim to boost the inherent ability of the human host to detect and eliminate C. trachomatis and potentially other intracellular pathogens."
"9471477","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  This application is submitted in response to RFA DK-13-003 which solicits applications from qualified investigators for the continuation of the Drug Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN). Indiana University is one of the five founding clinical centers and has robustly participated in all DILIN operations since its inception. We propose the following specific aims to meet the goals of this RFA. Specific Aim # 1: To enroll large number of eligible adults with suspected DILI into ongoing DILIN studies. We propose to collect prospective cases of suspected DILI from multiple sources in Central Indiana, each providing distinctive epidemiological facets and research potential. Specific Aim # 2: To enroll significant number of eligible children with suspected DILI into ongoing DILIN studies. We propose to include Cincinnati Children's Hospital as a satellite site to significantly increase the number of children enrolled into ongoing DILIN studies. Specific Aim # 3: The DILI is currently a diagnosis of exclusion and it can be a challenging diagnosis to make. We propose to conduct two ancillary studies in order to develop tests that facilitate the diagnosis of DILI: (i) we will conduct a discovery proteomic study of individuals with acute liver injury due to DILI and non-DILI etiologies enrolled within two weeks of liver injury onset to identify biomarkers specific for acut liver injury due to DILI; (ii) DILI can sometime mimic autoimmune hepatitis and it is difficult to distinguish it from de novo autoimmune hepatitis. To address this clinical conundrum, we will conduct a preliminary study for autoantibody profiling using an auto-antigen array assay among individuals with (i) acute DILI with autoimmune hepatitis-like features, (ii) acute DILI without autoimmune hepatitis features, and (iii) acute autoimmune hepatitis without precedent medication exposure. Specific Aim # 4: DILI carries considerable mortality and morbidity but there is no treatment available other than withdrawing the offending agent. In order to address this unmet therapeutic need, we propose to conduct a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study of budesonide in individuals with well characterized hepatocellular DILI meeting predefined eligibility criteria. Our hypothesis is that oral budesonide, a steroid with hig glucocorticoid activity and substantial first pass elimination, attenuates liver injury and improve outcomes of patients with hepatocellular DILI."
"9344799","ABSTRACT The primary objective of this proposal is to conduct a comprehensive study of bone safety with concurrent use of tenofovir (TDF)-based pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention and depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) use for pregnancy prevention. Bone safety with the concurrent use of these agents is extremely relevant for young women in settings with high HIV burden and frequent use of DMPA, such as Uganda. As single interventions, both of these agents are known to reduce bone mineral density, a key marker for fracture risk.Bone fractures often result in lost wages and economic stability, severe consequences for young women. Furthermore, reductions in bone mass before the age of 25 can yield reduced peak bone mass, a frequent correlate of osteoporotic fracture later in life. Recent approvals of TDF-based PrEP from Sub-Saharan African drug authorities will accelerate its roll-out, making studies of its effects when added on top of other agents extremely timely and important for public health messaging. We hypothesize that there are direct links from concurrent TDF and DMPA use to bone loss through subclinical kidney injury or hypoestrogenism and will comprehensively assess markers of both mechanistic pathways. We will enroll a prospective cohort of 400 HIV- uninfected women ages 16-25 years initiating DMPA and condoms in Kampala, Uganda, and offer PrEP to all of them. Using radiologic, biochemical, and epidemiologic methods, the following specific aims will be addressed: 1) In a direct investigation of bone acquisition, we will use dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to assess whether young women using TDF-based PrEP and DMPA concurrently attain lower peak bone mass over a 24- month period and have evidence of disrupted microarchitecture, relative to women using either agent singly or neither agent; 2) We will investigate whether young women concurrently using TDF-based PrEP and DMPA experience: 1) higher rates of bone turnover, a direct precursor to bone loss and 2) markers distinguishing two mechanistic pathways between TDF and DMPA use and bone mass: subclinical kidney injury and hypoestrogenism; and 3) Using mediation analysis, we will identify the degree to which the pathways through subclinical kidney injury and hypoestrogenism account for changes in bone density among women concurrently using TDF-based PrEP and DMPA. This study will be the first to comprehensively evaluate and model reductions in bone mass, changes in bone metabolism, and the pathways between bone and kidney function and bone and estrogen that are altered by the simultaneous initiation of PrEP and DMPA during a critical time point of bone maturation for young women."
"9257243","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Challenges in prostate cancer management stem from 1) inability to distinguish indolent prostate cancer from aggressive malignancy with metastatic potential; 2) limited treatment options for recurrent, castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Reactivated androgen receptor (AR) in CRPC results from elevated expression and activity of AR, and increased de novo androgen biosynthesis from DHEA. Anti-AR/anti-androgen biosynthesis drugs inhibit post chemotherapy cancer for a few months, but response is not universal. Finding new predictors for cancer progression and new drug targets are high-priority goals. We will examine a novel aspect of androgen-activated AR signaling that was revealed from our study. This entails i) regulation of androgen homeostasis by the prostate-expressed SULT2B, a sulfotransferase which mediates sulfation of cholesterol and DHEA, and ii) enhanced activity of methylated AR. We show 1) SULT2B mRNA and protein levels are markedly reduced in clinical specimens and IHC staining of tissue microarrays revealed highly statistically significant (p<0.001) loss of SULT2B in cancer tissue; 2) SULT2B silencing caused increased proliferation of prostate cancer cells; 3) Vitamin D receptor (VDR) and the oxysterol-inducible liver X receptor (LXR) can induce the SULT2B gene (SULT2B1); 4) AR is monomethylated at a lysine residue in its hinge domain by the SET9 lysine methyltransferase. SET9 depletion reduced wild type but not methylation-site-mutant AR activity; 5) LSD1, a histone lysine demethylase can convert methylated AR to unmethylated AR; 6) LXR-? is a potential regulator of genes encoding SET9 and LSD1, since LXR-responsive cis elements are present in these two genes based on in silico analysis. We have developed an antibody that can specifically recognize lysine- methylated AR by western blotting. We hypothesize that advanced prostate cancer associates with reduced SULT2B and elevated methyl-modified AR, LXR-? inhibits prostate cancer in part by preventing loss of SULT2B and elevation of methylated AR, and VDR synergizes LXR effects. The hypothesis is built from our own results and from reports that i) LXR- -/- mice show heightened androgen sensitivity in ventral prostates, but no change in AR levels; ii) steroid sulfatase (Sts) which counters DHEA sulfation, was induced in prostates of Lxr- -/- mice and suppressed in LXR- -activated mice; iii) LXR inhibited prostate cancer in xenograft tumors. We propose to determine: Aim 1) significance of SULT2B loss in prostate cancer, and a role for DNA methylation in this loss. We will examine i) diverse specimens for association of low SULT2B in cancer tissue with i) DHT levels and AR target gene expression, ii) levels of the enzymes AKR1C3 & SRD5A1, and iii) methylation status of the SULT2B1 gene.

"9481458","An Optical Probe capable of Activating/Reporting on axon activity in nerves of parasympathetic nervous system would be a boon to researchers working with the pancreas. We are proposing to develop such a Probe using our background and experience in optogenetics in the peripheral nerve, bio-imaging and compact multiphoton microscope design. Current neuro-modulation approaches for the vagus nerve are generally all or nothing events that cause simultaneous changes in heart rate, for example, along with changes in pancreatic function.  We propose to develop a novel compact Optogenetic based Optical Probe capable of optically neuromodulating individual afferent and/or efferent axons within nerves of the parasympathetic, or peripheral, nervous system. We seek to read-in or read-out from these nerves with the goal of modulating organs or brain circuits innervated by them.  Our central premise is that we can use optics to communicate with axons in a nerve. For optical approaches to work we need to convert action potentials into an optical signal. This can be done using reporter proteins or by some other means that is ancillary to action potential generation. Because nerves do not naturally express optical proteins, we will work with transgenic mice that express these proteins and use these mice to refine our system before making it available for other researchers to use.  We will develop a bench-top Optical instrument that can be shared with other research teams to allow us, and them, to interrogate specific fascicles and axons within mouse, and ultimately human, nerves. Our goal here is the vagus nerve and its innervation of the pancreas. The vagus nerve is one of the main conduits into the parasympathetic nervous system. The ability to interface with this nerve gives one the ability to neuromodulate the viscera in one direction and the brain in the other. We are proposing to couple an optical fiber with an electrowetting lens head to allow remote interrogation the vagus nerve with a bench top (i.e. portable) laser system. Integration of miniature (1mm diameter) scale electrowetting electrically tunable optics with an optical fiber-based imaging system will enable two-photon fluorescence imaging of neuron activity by readout of a fluorescent indicator.  We will work with our collaborators in the field of pancreatic research to test, refine and demonstrate our ability to activate/report from in-vitro mouse vagus nerves and to see if we can control and/or sense pancreatic responses in the absence of other responses, such as a change in heart rate, using targeted neuro-modulation of specific axons in the vagus in in-vivo transgenic mice experiments."
"9337099","Project Summary/Abstract Reducing drug toxicity while enhancing efficacy represents a major goal of precision medicine. In this SBIR Phase I application we propose a novel concept in drug therapy, that is, the development of a ?pharmacoprotector,? a small molecule that is co-administered with a second drug to reduce its toxicity allowing it to be more safely and efficaciously used. The overall goal of the proposed research is to discover and validate lead small molecule pharmacoprotectors, which inhibit the organic cation transporter, OCT2, a transporter highly expressed in tissues of toxicity for anti-cancer platinum drugs. In particular, OCT2 is expressed in the kidney, cochlea and basal ganglia cells of neurons. A second goal is to obtain proof-of-concept data using a prescription drug, ketoconazole, which was identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of the organic cation transporter 2, OCT2. OCT2 has recently been shown to be involved in the accumulation of two highly toxic anti-cancer platinum drugs in various tissues: (i) oxaliplatin accumulation in the nervous system leading to peripheral neuropathy and (ii) cisplatin accumulation in cochlear and renal epithelia leading to the ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity associated with the drug. Two aims are proposed. In Aim 1, we will identify OCT2 specific small molecule inhibitors as lead ?pharmacoprotectors? by screening a small chemical library of 30,000 patentable drug-like compounds enriched in compounds with the structural features of OCT2 inhibitors. In Aim 2, we will perform in vitro assays to test lead compounds identified in Aim 1 for their abilities to reduce the toxicities and uptake of oxaliplatin and cisplatin in various cancer cell lines. In addition, we will evaluate the pharmacokinetics, and tissue accumulation of oxaliplatin and cisplatin in mice with and without concomitant administration of ketoconazole. Our methods and analyses for our studies will include high throughput screening assays using a fluorescent probe assay in OCT2 over-expressing cell lines, in vitro assays for cytotoxicity and platinum uptake, analysis of plasma and tissue samples with ICP-mass spectrometry to detect platinum; pharmacokinetic analysis of plasma and tissue samples; and. The longterm goal of the proposed research is to develop FDA approved pharmacoprotectors that can be used in combination with oxaliplatin to modulate its dose-limiting toxicity, peripheral neuropathy, and cisplatin, to reduce both ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity."
"9205171","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Abstract: Clonal diseases of large granular lymphocytes (LGL) are characterized by lymphocytosis and autoimmune manifestations including rheumatoid arthritis, pulmonary hypertension, and bone marrow failure. Several related syndromes have similar pathology involving the bone marrow including aplastic anemia (AA), paroxysmal nocturnal hemaglobinuria (PNH), and a subset of patients with Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Clinical improvement occurs after immunosuppressive therapy (IST) suggesting that activated T-cell induce this syndrome. The broad long-term objectives of this proposal are to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients with LGL leukemia and other diseases associated with hyperactive memory T-cells. In our earlier studies of survival regulation in this disease, our lab was the first to demonstrate constitutive activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) transcription factor (STAT3) DNA binding. STAT-family proteins, including STAT3, play a critical role in many biological processes. They have proven oncogenic potential in several forms of cancer including breast, prostate, pancreas, leukemia and lymphoma. Until recently, the mechanism causing STAT3 activation was unknown. Recurrent mutations in the STAT3 Src homology-2 (SH2) domain were identified through exome sequencing by two independent international groups in 2012. More than 80% of the STAT3 mutations result in amino acid substitutions at position Y640F or D661Y (called mutSTAT3 throughout the application). Although these two amino acids have no known function in STAT3 activation, they have the potential to alter major protein-protein interactions with activated cytokine receptors or to strengthen carboxy-terminal phosphotyrosine 705 (Y705)-mediated dimerization. There is a known linkage between STAT3 and memory T-cell differentiation. A dominant negative STAT3 mutation occurs in patients with Hyper IgE Syndrome (HIES, or Job Syndrome). In these patients, a reduction in central memory T-cell development suggests that STAT3 may be involved in the regulation of memory T-cell differentiation. Mice with targeted deletion of STAT3 in T-cells also have a loss of central memory T-cells and an accumulation of inactive terminal memory cells during viral infection. Overexpression of active STAT3 in T-cells will close an important knowledge gap in the precise role of STAT3 in memory T-cell differentiation. Since the Y640F and D661Y represent the first naturally-occurring mutations with potential for gain-of-function, we will be able to address important questions with human disease relevance. The hypothesis to be tested in this application is that the naturally-occurring STAT3 mutations (Y640F and D661Y) alter SH2 domain structural properties leading to constitutive activation. Expression of this activated form of STAT3 then contributes to aberrant survival and expansion of T-cells with an effector memory phenotype capable of injuring normal tissues. Our research design will include three specific aims (SA): 1) to prove that naturally-occurring STAT3 mutations (mutSTAT3) increase survival by altering the STAT3 activation threshold, 2) to prove that Y640F and D661Y alter SH2 peptide domain interactions and serve as a unique target for drug design and, 3) to confirm our hypothesis that mutSTAT3 induces T-cell activation in memory T-cells to induce survival and tissue damage. Due to the prevalence and health care costs associated with autoimmune cytopenias, and the overwhelming devastation and poor treatment options of autoimmune diseases in Veterans, we believe our project is broadly relevant to the Veteran population and is focused on a critical health problem of interest to VA R&D."
"9265722","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed research network will be to identify opportunities for later-life reversibility/remediation of phenotypes associated with early life adversity (ELA) by bringing together an international group of senior and junior scientists to foster and facilitate the interdisciplinary research needed to stimulate rapid advances in this field. The network will: (a) promote needed increases in scientific knowledge regarding the array of processes and pathways through which different ELAs (e.g., low socio-economic status [SES], stressful experiences, poor parent-child relationships, maternal nutrition and lifestyle) may similarly or differentially impact later life health and well-being, and (b) leverage evidence from (a) to promote development and evaluation of novel later-life interventions to reverse/reduce risk processes related to ELAs. Specific aims for this network will be to: (1). Build capacity to advance interdisciplinary research exploring the potential for midlife reversibility of or/compensation for risks conferred by ELA by convening biannual international, interdisciplinary meetings of researchers with expertise spanning animal and human research and a shared interest in collaborative work to: (a) foster better understanding of the life-course mechanisms/pathways linking ELA to trajectories of later life health and well-being; (b) develop and test later-life interventions to reduce or even completely reverse risks to health and well-being associated with ELA, and (c) identify resource needs to advance this agenda and devise strategies for their development. (2). Support new research on reversibility/remediation through seed/pilot funding; (3). Bring new researchers into the field by offering opportunities for engagement in network activities, including (a) collaborations on pilot or other projects, (b) participation in network meetings/workshops as affiliated researchers, and (c) funded internships with network researchers; and (4). Pursue active out-reach through dissemination and engagement with the broader research community through: (a) a network website; (b) annual network workshops or symposia at various professional meetings that include disciplinary interests in life-course influences on early adversity, and (c) publishing one or more articles or a special issue on the potential for later-life reversibility/remediation for ELA, focued on potential bio-behavioral or other targets and promising intervention approaches. In accomplishing these aims, the proposed network will (a) contribute significantly to promoting needed theoretical and empirical work to clarify how major ELAs impact adult health and well-being, including addressing unanswered questions regarding the mediators and moderators of these influences at different life- stages and (b) support and promote the interdisciplinary collaborations needed to develop effective interventions for mid- and later life adults that can remediate/reverse and therefore to ameliorate effects of early life adversity."

"9271131","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Diversity, its growth and complexity, are defining features of the dramatic aging of the world-wide population. Research demonstrates that older adults from disadvantaged populations are at elevated risk of poor health, disability and premature death. The National Institutes of Health are committed to reducing and eliminating health disparities. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention state that health disparities related to sexual orientation are one of the main gaps in health disparities research. Existing evidence demonstrates that lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) older adults are an at-risk, under-investigated and under-served health disparate population. This study will examine the determinants of health impacting LGB older adults to assess change in health and quality of life (QOL) over time. Based on an innovative resilience conceptual framework, the pro- posed longitudinal research will obtain data from 2,000 LGB older adults who participated in the original study in order to allow us to understand the inter-relationships between risk and protective factors as well as cohort effects as they impact health and QOL of LGB older adults over time. This multidisciplinary collaboration of University of Washington researchers and community-based collaborators addresses a critical gap by identifying modifiable mechanisms impacting health and QOL over time. The primary goals of the project are as follows: 1) Investigate how lifetime victimization, everyday discrimination, stress (perceived stress and physiological response to stress) and health behavior change affects health and QOL of LGB older adults over time; 2) Evaluate how social relations (time-varying) and sexual identity management (time-varying) affect the associations among everyday discrimination, stress, health and QOL over time; and, 3) Test whether there is cohort heterogeneity in overall levels and age growth trajectories of health and QOL, and to what extent the differences in experiences within a historical context (e.g., time of sexual identity disclosure, lifetime victimization) between Baby Boom and Silent Generation LGB older adults account for these cohort effects. As the population ages, the health care costs associated with health disparities will continue to rise. To respond to this growing public health challenge it is imperative to identfy groups at high risk of disparities and to determine the modifiable mechanisms impacting their health and QOL as they age. The findings from this project will generate needed information to directly inform and guide the development of tailored interventions that can be effectively delivered within community-based agency settings to improve the health and QOL of demographically diverse older adults."
"9275348","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):       The enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are a genetically diverse type of pathogenic E. coli that cause astounding numbers of cases of diarrheal illness worldwide, and have emerged as a cause of large-scale outbreaks of diarrhea in the United States.  These organisms share the ability to produce, secrete, and deliver heat-stable (ST) and/or heat-liable (LT) toxins to the intestinal lining cells ultimately causing diarrhea, which can be severe and cholera-like.  The toxin genes encoded on plasmids, were identified shortly after the discovery of these toxin-producing E. coli more than 40 years ago.  Most research on ETEC until very recently focused on a small number of molecules, namely the toxins themselves and plasmid-encoded fingerlike colonization factors (CFs). Unfortunately, vaccine development centered on these antigens alone has proven to be very challenging in part because of the heterogeneity of the CF molecules and the fact that the toxins do not appear to afford complete protection against disease (in the case of LT), or are not immunogenic (as is the case for ST).  The recent failure of several vaccines incorporating these antigens has prompted both a search for alternative strategiesand a return to basic pathogenesis studies in order to address gaps in our understanding of how these globally important pathogens cause disease.  While much is known about the molecular action of these toxins once they enter host cells, very little is known about how the bacteria effectively deliver these toxins to their respective cell surface receptors.  These studies will use recently developed molecular tools, capitalize on recent discoveries of new agents, and exploit the state-of-the-art methodology to define the roll of novel molecules on the surface of ETEC that promote the effective delivery of these toxins. The long-term goal of these studies is to translate this information into rational design of a safe, effective, and broadly protective ETEC vaccine."

His Cardiometabolic Research Program is dedicated to human translational and genomic studies of cardiometabolic diseases (CMD). His program is based in Penn's Cardiovascular (CVI) and Translational (ITMAT) Institutes and is highly integrated into the training missions sponsored by Penn's Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA). This provides an outstanding environment for translational POR and for mentoring K24 trainees. He has had a track record of continuous NIH funding, mentorship of multiple physician scientists in translational POR, and numerous high-impact publications led by multiple K24 trainees, several of whom have established their own independent POR careers. Dr Reilly is committed to training young clinical investigators in cutting-edge translational technologies and mentoring them to independent careers in POR. With current K24 support, he has been successful in mentoring a new generation of POR researchers (thirty K24 trainees) and in expanding his own POR in CMD (PI for 3 R01, one U01). In this K24 renewal, he proposes to (1) augment his scientific and mentoring skills and devote more time to mechanistic POR, (2) focus on mentoring new clinical investigators in mechanistic POR, and (3) pursue innovative POR in a unique training environment for mentoring young clinical investigators to independent careers in POR.  Macrophages represent a critical cell type at the intersection of many CMDs. Reilly's group has developed a method for differentiating human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC) to macrophages (IPS-DM), a powerful system for macrophages functional genomics. Current K24 work shows that (a) IPS-DM are phenotypically and transcriptionally similar to their primary counterparts, (b) IPS-DM can be activated to functionally distinct M1 and M2 phenotypes, and (c) IPS-DM from Tangier disease patients reproduce disease specific macrophage phenotypes. Although recent genomic discoveries have identified multiple novel loci for CMD, the key challenge remains in defining the role of specific cell types, including macrophages, in causing disease. Alternative splicing (AS) plays a critical role in tissue and cell-specific functins but its role in macrophage phenotypes is also unknown. In preliminary studies, the Reilly group performed (a) CRISPR/Cas gene-editing in hiPSC of a LIPA, a novel loci for CAD, to study (in Aim 1) macrophage-specific functions of LIPA GWAS CAD risk alleles and (b) genome-wide RNA-seq analysis of splicing factors (SFs) in macrophages to explore (in Aim 2) a role for specific SFs (CELF1 and RBM43) and alternative splicing (AS) in macrophage- specific functions and human disease.  Dr. Reilly will dedicate 25% effort to this K24 proposal (5% to augment his mentorship and POR skills; 5% to the research proposal; and 15% to mentoring). The K24 renewal will allow him to expand his mechanistic POR program while simultaneously dedicating experienced effort to train young clinical investigators."
"9264012","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Asthma is a common condition in the older population and associated with worse morbidity and mortality compared to younger individuals. Various self-management behaviors (SMB), medication adherence in particular, are key for achieving good asthma control. Unfortunately, less than half of older asthmatics regularly adhere to their controller medications and to other SMB. Several observations suggest that symptom perception may be a major determinant of asthma SMB and outcomes in older adults. First, experimental studies consistently demonstrate that many older adults are substantially less aware of their level of airway obstruction. Second, under-perception of asthma symptoms is linked to elevated risk of near-fatal and fatal asthma attacks and increased morbidity among younger adults. Third, cognitive impairment, commonly associated with aging, has been identified as a key determinant of under-perception of symptoms in younger asthmatics. Fourth, interventions to correct symptom under-perception in children have been shown to improve asthma medication adherence. Despite the greater vulnerability of older asthmatics to poor asthma outcomes and their diminished ability to perceive the severity of their airway obstruction, the association of symptom perception with asthma SMB and outcomes has not been studied in this population. The goal of this project is to determine how symptom perception influences the management and outcomes of older asthmatics and to pilot test an intervention to correct under-perception. The Specific Aims are: 1) Prospectively assess the association between symptom perception and asthma morbidity among older adults; 2) Examine the association between symptom perception and asthma SMB among older adults and identify the pathways (via illness and medication beliefs) linking them; 3) Determine the influence of cognition on symptom perception among older adults with asthma; 4) Pilot test an intervention to correct under-perceptions of asthma symptoms in older adults. We will conduct a prospective cohort study of 400 asthmatics ?60 years of age recruited from East Harlem and the Bronx in New York City. We will measure symptom perception in naturalistic settings using an innovative and validated methodology and repeatedly collect data on illness and medication beliefs, cognitive functioning, SMB (including objective measures of medication adherence), and asthma morbidity over 12 months. At the end of the observation period, we will pilot test an intervention to improve symptom perception on a random sample of 80 participants. The proposed study is significant for its potential to greatly advance understanding of the mechanisms related to low adherence to SMB and worse outcomes in older asthmatics, a vulnerable and understudied population."
"9328800","PROJECT SUMMARY Atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the main cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Among the several cell types and processes involved in atherogenesis, the role of macrophages in the formation of high-risk plaques is well established and characterized. The past 15 years have seen tremendous efforts to develop and validate non-invasive imaging to quantify plaque macrophages and improve CVD patients management. Even nowadays, the role of imaging continues to be advocated to better define atherosclerosis and to improve assessment of therapeutic regimens.18F-FDG PET is a non-invasive, translational imaging technique widely used and validated to quantify plaque macrophages in vivo. However, vascular 18F-FDG PET still carries several important limitations. For example, while 18F-FDG vessel wall accumulation has been consistently correlated to plaque inflammation, uptake is not specific for macrophages, and can be influenced by other factors, such as hypoxia and vascular density. To overcome these limitations, several novel PET tracers more specific to unique molecules, receptors and cells involved in plaque inflammation are currently being investigated. 68Ga-DOTATATE is a novel PET tracer, recently approved by the FDA to improve detection of somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2) -positive neuroendocrine tumors. SSTR2s are also overexpressed on activated plaque macrophages. Preliminary studies have found 68Ga-DOTATATE to accumulate in macrophage-rich plaques in atherosclerotic mice. Retrospective analyses have confirmed accumulation in the atherosclerotic vessel wall in cancer patients. Building on these previous studies, we propose to establish and translate 68Ga-DOTATATE as a specific, non-invasive marker of atherosclerotic plaque macrophages. In parallel with mechanistic studies in atherosclerotic mice on PET/CT, we will translate 68Ga-DOTATATE PET on a combined PET/MR scanner in large animals (rabbits) and patients with coronary atherosclerosis. 68Ga-DOTATATE may be particularly useful when imaging this challenging vascular territory, where 18F-FDG PET is notoriously difficult because of the strong, non-specific myocardial background uptake. Our laboratory is deeply involved in translational PET/MRI for imaging of coronary atherosclerosis, by developing innovative motion correction, partial volume correction algorithms and dynamic PET imaging to improve PET tracers uptake in the coronary arteries (R01 HL071021, PI Fayad). We anticipate that establishing 68Ga-DOTATATE PET may allow improving the management of CVD patients, the quantitative assessment of novel anti-atherosclerotic compounds, and, in the future, prove useful to improve diagnosis of other CVD conditions. While beyond the scope of our work, this proposal is the basis for more extensive, prospective clinical trials investigating the predictive value of 68Ga-DOTATATE PET and other promising imaging markers for CVD events."
"9275418","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Alcohol use disorders (AUD) occur commonly in Veterans and produce serious morbidity and mortality. Alcohol damages the nervous system across the lifespan, leading to crippling neurological disorders in adults and fetal alcohol spectrum disorders in children with gestational exposure to alcohol. Both stages of life are relevant to Veterans, since returning Veterans comprise a growing proportion of women of childbearing age with AUDs. This proposal extends ongoing work directed at identifying medications that will prevent or reverse the toxic effects of alcohol on the nervous system at all stages of life. Alcohol causes developmental toxicity in the brain partly by blocking cell adhesion mediated by the L1 neural cell adhesion molecule. Alcohol blocks diverse actions of L1 that follow L1 adhesion, including L1-mediated axon outgrowth (L1MAO) and L1 activation of Src Family Kinase (SFK) signaling. Alcohol also blocks signaling through SFK for two other important growth factors: netrin-1 and GDNF. Alcohol interacts with a binding pocket on the extracellular domain of L1 (L1-ECD) - the portion of the molecule that protrudes from the cell membrane and binds to L1 molecules on other cells. Phosphorylation of specific residues in the L1 cytoplasmic domain (L1-CD) does not block L1 adhesion, but abolishes ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion, presumably by altering the conformation of the alcohol binding pocket in the L1-ECD. Importantly, certain small molecules and peptides also block alcohol inhibition of L1 adhesion, and these alcohol antagonists prevent alcohol-induced damage to the developing brain. The small peptide NAPVSIPQ (NAP) protects the nervous system against a wide array of insults, including prenatal alcohol exposure. NAP blocks the effects of alcohol on L1 adhesion, L1MAO, and L1 signaling at femtomolar concentrations (as low as one part per quadrillion). The mechanism by which NAP acts so potently is unknown. Here we will investigate how NAP blocks the effects of alcohol in cultures of cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) and slices of cerebellar cortex from postnatal, adolescent, and adult rats [and in an in vivo model of early postnatal alcohol exposure.] There are three objectives: 1. to determine whether NAP blocks ethanol inhibition of L1 adhesion by modulating phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain; 2. to learn whether NAP blocks ethanol inhibition of SFK activation by L1, netrin-1, and GDNF; 3. to determine whether NAP prevents or reverses alcohol cerebellar neurotoxicity across the lifespan. Cultures will be exposed to alcohol for varying periods of time in the absence and presence of alcohol, L1, netrin-1, and GDNF. We will systematically mutate phosphorylation sites in the L1-CD to simulate permanent phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of these sites. These constructs will then be treated with alcohol and NAP to identify specific mutations that render NAP incapable of blocking the effects of alcohol. We will then test whether NAP modulates the activity of kinases or phosphatases that act at the identified sites. Alcohol inhibits axon outgrowth in CGNs by blocking the activatio of SFK by diverse growth factors. We will determine whether NAP blocks the effects of alcohol on the activation of SFK by L1, netrin-1, and GDNF in mature CGNs and cerebellar slices from postnatal day 7 (P7) rats. We will then determine whether NAP antagonizes the effects of alcohol on neuronal survival, neuronal networks, and growth factor signaling in slices from early postnatal (P7), adolescent (P40), and adult (P80) cerebellum and [in cerebellum from rats and mice exposed to ethanol during the early postnatal period.] These studies will help characterize the mechanism of action of NAP, a potent alcohol antagonist, and will lay the groundwork for the development of treatments to prevent and reverse alcohol neurotoxicity in the brain."
"9271214","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This program project grant (P01) application is a renewal of the current grant: Mechanisms and Interventions Addressing Serious Hazards of Transfusion and Cellular Therapies. This Program represents an integrative endeavor by the Emory University Center for Transfusion and Cellular Therapies (CTCT) which includes a group of physician-scientists dedicated to the advancement of the field of transfusion medicine and cellular therapies via basic, translational and clinical research, excellence in clinical care and teaching, and the education of future leaders and scientists. The investigators are grateful that the current 6 year funding period has allowed us to improve our synergistic interactions and make significant progress in the previously funded investigations. Furthermore, we believe that this renewal application represents a significantly improved set of interrelated projects. The central theme of this P01 renewal has been modified to be more consistent between projects, allowing greater cross-project interactions and synergy between investigators. We still address Serious Hazards of Transfusion, but our focus is on those hazards that occur in transfusion recipients following infusion of RBCs that have been stored for extended periods of time prior to transfusion (herein called storage-aged RBC [saRBCs]). These hazards include shortened RBC survival and alterations in NO-mediated vaso-responsiveness in adult recipients (Project 1), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) in neonatal patients (Project 2), altered alloimmune responsiveness in transplant patients (Project 3), and shortened RBC survival (Project 4). The primary goal of the Projects in this Program is to develop a panel of RBC biomarkers that identify RBCs that have entered a state of impaired functionality that not only predisposes these cells to reduced post-transfusion survival but leads to adverse effects in the transfusion recipient. While current evidence supports the contention that generally the longer RBCs are stored the less efficacious they will be and the more likely they are to cause adverse events, we believe that a simplistic formulation based on chronological storage age is ultimately counter-productive. Rather, transfusion efficacy and safety can be improved by utilizing biomarkers to test for the metabolic age of RBC units."
"9265734","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a Resubmission Application for a Mentored Patient-Oriented Research Career Development Award for Dr. Rebecca Brown. Dr. Brown's long-term goal is to become a leader in aging research to improve the health and functional status of socioeconomically disadvantaged older adults, including those with early- onset (premature) geriatric syndromes. This award will provide Dr. Brown with the support necessary to continue her progress towards this goal, by obtaining additional training in several key areas and by completing the proposed mentored research project.  The proposed career award addresses a critical knowledge gap: the epidemiology and outcomes of geriatric syndromes that develop in adults younger than age 65. Although it is well-recognized that some adults develop aging phenotypes at an age when most adults remain physically robust, very little is known about the epidemiology, outcomes, and potential management strategies of these individuals. Dr. Brown's proposed career development plan will allow her to address this knowledge gap by working with a team of superb mentors who will supervise the following three training goals: (1) to achieve expertise in clinical research methods and content areas which are critical to her future success as an independent clinician investigator (advanced methods for secondary data analysis, methods for the design, conduct, and analysis of clinical trials, social determinants of health, and qualitative research); (2) to create key developmental networks at UCSF and nationally; and (3) to develop grant-writing and research management skills and experience. Dr. Brown will achieve these goals by conducting the proposed research project with the close guidance and support of her mentorship team. In addition, her training will be supported by high-value didactic courses, tutorials, and seminars. The skills and experience she acquires from this training will prepare her to become an independent investigator and to successfully apply for an R01 grant implementing an intervention to identify and manage premature geriatric syndromes.  Dr. Brown's research will describe the epidemiology and risk factors for premature geriatric syndromes (Aim 1), and will identify the relationship between premature geriatric syndromes and adverse outcomes, including hospitalization, institutionalization, and mortality (Aim 2). Dr. Brown will accomplish Aims 1 and 2 using longitudinal data from the nationally representative Health and Retirement Study. She will then conduct a qualitative study to better understand patient and clinician perspectives on the clinical needs of patients with premature geriatric syndromes, and to identify models of care that may help to address those needs (Aim 3)."
"9275378","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The small intestinal epithelium renews every 3-5 days. To maintain this high rate of cell loss, new cells are continuously generated from a population of multi-potent intestinal stem cells (ISCs). A more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms that regulate ISC function has enormous implications for the study of gut injury repair, normal homeostasis and gastrointestinal cancer. Although the precise identity and location of ISCs remains under intense debate, recent studies using elegant reporter mouse models have suggested that two distinct ISC populations exist, one quiescent population, located at the +4 position relative to the crypt bottom just above the Paneth cells. The other stem cell population is characterized by rapidly cycling crypt base columnar cells (CBCs) interspersed between the Paneth cells. These +4 cells have been implicated in a rescue stem cell response following radiation injury (IR). We have previously reported that the putative ISC marker Dclk1 (formerly known as DCAMKL-1) is predominantly expressed in the +4 position in the crypt is relatively quiescent under basal conditions and is mostly distinct from the proliferative stem cells (CBCs). Gastrointestinal stem cells are increasingly being recognized as potential cells of origin in colon cancer. It has been demonstrated that DCLK1 is upregulated in human colorectal cancers (CRC) and can be used as a prognostic marker. Interestingly siRNA-mediated knockdown of DCLK1 results in colorectal tumor xenograft growth arrest, inhibition of c-Myc, KRAS via let-7a miRNA, Notch-1 via miR-144 and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated factors via miR-200a. The central hypothesis of this VA Merit proposal is that Dclk1 plays a key role in regulating the rescue stem cell population in response to severe genotoxic and potentially mutagenic injury, and these rescue/reserve cells are potential cells of origin that can contribute to gastrointestinal neoplasia. To test this hypothesis, we propose 3 specific aims: Aim 1: To determine whether Dclk1 regulates small intestinal and colonic regenerative responses after injury via genes related to Wnt and Notch signaling, EMT and epithelial barrier function. Dclk1 knockout (Villin-Cre; Dclk1flox/flox) and wild type mice will be subjected to: (a) whole body IR (genotoxic injury) to evaluate the effects of deletion of +4 rescue stem cell population in the crypt regenerative response; (b) DSS- induced colitis (cytotoxic injury) and (c) Azoxymethane (AOM)+DSS (mutagenic insult) to evaluate the effects of epithelial Dclk1 knockout in colonic crypt regeneration and tumorigenesis. Aim 2: To determine whether Dclk1+ cell is the origin of the regenerative crypt and cell of origin of cancer after genotoxic/cytotoxic injury and mutagenic insult respectively. Using a reporter mouse model (Dclk1-Cre-ERTM;Rosa26GFP), where GFP is expressed in Dclk1+ cells and their progeny, lineage tracing studies will be performed. We will examine the effects of genotoxic, cytotoxic and mutagenic injuries on this mouse model to determine whether the Dclk1+ cell is the cell of origin of regenerative crypts and cancer. Aim 3: To determine whether DCLK1 can be used as an early diagnostic marker for colorectal neoplasia (i.e. adenoma) detection. Here, we will determine whether DCLK1 can be detected in the circulation of patients with colorectal neoplasia and correlate with tissue immunostaining. We will also determine CSC properties of DCLK1+ cells isolated from human CRC blood samples. Furthermore, DCLK1 potentially can be used as a tissue and serum diagnostic marker of early colorectal neoplasia. CRC continues to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the Veteran population and there is emerging evidence that cancer stem cells are the key initiators of colon cancer. These studies have the major potential to fill a major unmet medical need."
"9265380","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Individuals 70 and older are the fastest growing group of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Research shows that decision-making regarding initiation of dialysis is impaired by poor communication and lack of understanding about the options for management of ESRD. Some small studies suggest that, among older adults, dialysis may be associated with longer life expectancy but possibly worse quality of life, compared to conservative management without dialysis. Yet little is known about what older adults can expect after initiating dialysis in terms of patient-centered outcomes such as functional status and cognitive function. Furthermore, even though the choice regarding dialysis initiation involves a series of difficult trade-offs between potential longevity gains with dialysi and potentially better quality of life with conservative management, there has been little research into patient, family, and clinician perspectives on this decision-making process, and very few resources exist to promote decision-making that reflects patients' values and informed treatment preferences. This proposal has the following three interrelated and complementary aims that address these challenges related to dialysis decision-making: 1) Define the trajectories of functional status and cognitive function for adults 70 and older with ESRD before and after initiation of dialysis, compared to the trajectories of adults not on dialysis. 2) Explor perspectives about the decision to initiate dialysis (versus maximum conservative management) among adults 70 and older, their families, and clinicians. 3) Develop and pilot test a decision aid for decisionally-capable older patients with impending ESRD and their families, designed to improve knowledge about dialysis and conservative management options and to improve clarity about one's values and treatment preferences.  The first project is a quantitative analysis using nationally-representative longitudinal survey data from the Health and Retirement Study, linked with Medicare claims. The second project features qualitative semistructured interviews with patients, family members, and clinicians who are at different points in the decisionmaking process (before and after deciding about dialysis). The third project will use the knowledge gained from Aims 1 and 2 to inform the design of a decision aid specifically for decisionally-capable adults 70 and older who are expected to need dialysis within 12 months, which will be pilot-tested with patients. The results from Aim 3 will contribute preliminary data to an R01 proposal of a randomized-controlled trial of the decision aid.         The overall objective of this K23 Career Development Award is to support the early career of Dr. Melissa Wachterman, a palliative care physician and health services researcher at Harvard Medical School. Dr. Wachterman is a promising junior investigator specializing in research related to geriatric palliative care. Her career goal is to become an independently-funded clinician-investigator conducting research that improves quality of care and patient-centered treatment decision-making for seriously-ill older adults and their families. This proposal builds o Dr. Wachterman's prior research on end-of-life care for older adults with chronic diseases such as dementia and her more recent work exploring older patients' perspectives on dialysis and communication barriers between nephrologists and patients when discussing prognosis.         This K23 award will help Dr. Wachterman accomplish the following goals: 1) to obtain advanced training in biostatistics and epidemiology, including analytic skills using both longitudinal nationallyrepresentative survey data and administrative data; 2) to acquire advanced training in qualitative research methods; 3) to acquire an understanding of theoretical frameworks of shared decision-making and develop skills in decision aid development and evaluation; 4) to develop as an investigator to ensure a successful transition from this career development award to independent R01-level funding.         To achieve these goals, Dr. Wachterman has chosen a mentoring team committed to her success as a clinician investigator that capitalizes on her joint appointments at three leading academic medical centers affiliated with Harvard Medical School: Brigham and Women's Hospital, VA Boston Healthcare System, and Dana Farber Cancer Institute. Her primary mentor is Dr. Nancy Keating, Associate Professor of Medicine and Health Policy at Harvard Medical School and an internationally-recognized health services researcher with expertise in palliative care. Her co-mentor is Dr. Edward Marcantonio, a geriatrician and internationallyrenowned clinical investigator in aging research. To complement the extensive expertise of Drs. Keating and Marcantonio, Dr. Wachterman has worked closely with them to carefully select a group of talented local advisors to provide additional knowledge and experience in qualitative research, decision science, nephrology, and biostatistics. She has also enlisted the support of a Steering Committee of nationally-known leaders with expertise relevant to her proposal. Overall, Dr. Wachterman will benefit greatly from working in Harvard's vibrant research community, which will provide her with skilled mentorship and support as she prepares to embark on her career as an independent investigator."
"9295148","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Diabetes mellitus has increased dramatically in the U.S. during the last several decades and has rapidly become a major challenge to our healthcare system. Many patients with diabetes are also hypertensive (HT), which substantially increases the risk for progression of diabetic nephropathy to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Clinical and experimental studies indicate that antihypertensive treatment only slows the progression of nephropathy to ESRD rather than halting it. Therefore, there is an urgent need to reveal the mechanisms responsible for diabetic-HT nephropathy and to identify new therapeutic targets. Preliminary studies in a type II diabetic animal model indicate that even a moderate increase in BP, when superimposed on moderate diabetes, greatly enhances renal injury as reflected by significantly increased proteinuria and rapid decline in GFR. In addition, inhibition of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and scavenging of reactive oxygen species (ROS) from mitochondria (MT) have renal protective effects, suggesting that ER stress and MT dysfunction may be key factors in contributing to the synergistic effects of HT plus diabetes. There is also evidence that mechanically sensitive transient receptor potential cation channels, subfamily C, member 6 (TRPC6) may have an important role in the development of glomerular injury in diabetic nephropathy. Therefore, it hypothesizes that coexistence of HT and diabetes in type II diabetes synergistically amplifies oxidative stress and cellular injury in podocytes and endothelium of glomeruli. This synergistic effect is mediated by HT-induced mechanical stretch which activates TRPC channels and is amplified by the interaction of ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired Ca2+ homeostasis. During the mentored phase, the molecular mechanisms by which mechanical forces induced by hypertension interact with diabetes to promote renal injury will be determined using in vitro and in vivo models. Synergistic effects of HT and diabetes on molecular pathways of ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and TRPC6 activation in glomerular capillary endothelial cells and podocytes will be evaluated as well. During the independent phase, the renal protective effect of TRPC6 deficiency in diabetic- HT kidney injury will be examined using novel genetically engineered animal models. Results from this study will provide novel information on the role of TRPC6 channels in mediating diabetic-HT nephropathy. Overall, this project will facilitate applicant's continued technical, intellectual, and professional training, and will assist the applicant in establishing an independent research laboratory at an academic research institution."
"9266837","Abstract Cortical interneurons represent a broad class of inhibitory neurons that are essential for controlling brain excitability and coordinating behavior. Disruption of inhibitory circuits has been implicated in a number of brain disorders, including epilepsy, intellectual disability, autism, schizophrenia, and head injury. Recently, advances in mouse and human stem cell research suggest that pluripotent cells can be used to generate enriched populations of cortical neurons and interneurons in vitro. However, few studies have systematically examined how exogenous inhibitory neurons derived from stem cell sources might be used as a cell-therapy to modify neural circuitry in vivo. The overall goal of this K99/R00 application is to determine how cortical interneurons derived from mouse and human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) functionally incorporate into the postnatal brain. The mentored phase of the award will be conducted at University of California, San Francisco under the guidance of Dr. Scott Baraban and the project will be continuted in my own laboratory after an independent faculty position is secured. In Specific Aims 1 and 2, I will use a promoter-based reporter construct to purify coritcal interneuron precursors generated from iPS cells and characterize their differentiation in vitro (Aim 1) and after transplantation (Aim 2) using a series of anatomical, molecular, and electrophysiological approaches. In Aim 3 (R00 phase), I will determine the connectivity patterns of iPS cell- derived interneurons grafted into the postnatal brain. Understanding how cortical interneurons generated from stem cell sources functionally incorporate into the recipient circuitry will provide new information about their functional plasticity and is a critical step toward translating these findings into new interneuron-based cell therapies. My long term goal is to build an independent dedicated to understanding mechanisms of neural circuit organization and to develop novel stem cell strategies for brain repair and regeneration, particularly for brain disorders associated with interneuron dysfunction. This research will require extensive training in stem cell biology, and UCSF is an outstanding institution to complete the mentored phase of this application, primarily due to the rich community of prominent neuroscientists and clinicians performing neural stem cell research and the pioneering role of UCSF in the stem cell field. In addition to Dr. Baraban's outstanding mentorship, I have assembled a team of internationally recognized scientists who will provide me with hands- on technical training, formal coursework, and career guidance during both phases of this proposal. Overall, these training experiences will be critical for me to successfully obtain an academic faculty position and establish my independent research program."
"9324462","PROJECT SUMMARY While the existence of multiple memory systems in the brain is generally accepted, it is not known how these different systems interact to result in continuously adaptive memory-guided behaviors and decisions. Recent results clearly show that particular combinations of memory-related brain systems show synchronized neural activity (at the population level, for example at the theta frequency) in a task-dependent way. Yet the informational and behavioral significance of such co-modulation of neural activity in not known perhaps in part because such measures are not temporally or informationally refine enough to reveal the significance of this interaction. This proposal aims to develop a novel paradigm for determining whether a specific type of information in one brain area can provide a signal to a connected memory structure to engage or disengage in its well-known memory-related function. Specifically, Aim 1 will test the causal relationship between neural signatures of planned behaviors in hippocampus and the regulation of working memory/action selection by the medial prefrontal cortex. Also, the subsequent impact of this neural directive on future action selection, as well as on future hippocampal place field integrity, will be examined. It is postulated that prefrontal cortex normally stabilizes place fields which in turn should enable rats to more quickly adapt to changing task conditions. Disruption of such prefrontal function, especially during the operation of working memory, should destabilize place fields and EEG phenomena that rely on fully function place fields. In addition, impaired choice accuracy is predicted. Aim 2 proposes to build on the exciting idea that hippocampal theta oscillates between periods of memory encoding and memory retrieval. The same open loop system that was developed in Aim 1 will be used to disrupt selectively working memory encoding or retrieval functions of the medial prefrontal cortex when encoding or retrieval are detected in hippocampus. The general prediction is that disrupting encoding in the prefrontal cortex will disproportionately impair the initial learning behavioral and neural processes relative to behavioral and neural processes that go on after learning has taken place. The combined results will provide new insight into the informational nature of communication between hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex. Also the closed loop paradigm can serve as an innovative and new model for studying the functional interactions between other memory and behavioral systems of the brain, which in turn can have tremendous clinical and therapeutic benefits. It may be possible to interfere with (in cases of unwanted specific associations) or facilitate (in cases of deficient desired associations) specific types of learning or learned associations that characterize a number of mental disorders."
"9275412","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Aging skeletal muscle exhibits a marked decrease in regenerative capabilities, which is associated with fatty infiltration and the deposition of fibrous connective tissue. This fibrotic deposition is particularly harmful because it interferes with proper muscle contraction. While this phenomenon has been widely documented, the mechanisms underlying this fibrosis are still under investigation. Unlike aged muscle, young muscle does not develop permanent fibrosis. However, it does display transient collagen deposition after acute injury. An understanding of the molecular pathways that trigger this collagen accumulation in young muscle as well as their dysregulation with age will be important for the development of therapeutics to prevent the progression of this pathology. Several studies have linked fibrosis to increased signaling of the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) pathway. Recently, it was shown that PDGF receptor alpha (PDGFR?) signaling promotes proliferation and differentiation of a population of muscle-resident fibroadipogenic progenitors (FAPs), which have been hypothesized to contribute to accumulation of both fibrous connective tissue and fat in muscle with age. Our preliminary data suggest that PDGFR? signaling is upregulated in FAPs upon muscle injury and that changes in this signaling pathway may influence their fibrogenic differentiation potential. We hypothesize that PDGFR? signaling in FAPs is responsible for their activation during muscle regeneration and that overstimulation of this pathway causes increased fibrosis.  We will examine this hypothesis by studying PDGFR? signaling during normal muscle regeneration and testing whether the stimulation and inhibition of the pathway affects the development of fibrosis, and how depletion of FAPs alters muscle regenerative capacity (Aim 1). We will examine how the levels of PDGFR? signaling change in muscle with age and we will investigate whether inhibiting signal transduction results in a reduction in fibrosis accumulation in aged muscle (Aim 2). Finally, we will explore the mechanisms by which the PDGFR? transcript is regulated (Aim 3). Our preliminary data suggest that multiple variants of the PDGFR? transcript are produced that that these variants may alter the ultimate expression of the PDGFR? protein. We will study how PDGFR? is regulated post-transcriptionally through an analysis of polyadenylation site selection.  Through our examination of this newly-discovered population of FAPs, we aim to understand the mechanisms that guide their activation in healthy muscle to assess their role in the fibrotic pathology of aged muscle. Our investigation will both allow for the production of new experimental tools to study this population and lend insight into therapeutic strategies to prevent age-related fibrosis. This will have direct relevance to Veterans who are suffering from skeletal muscle injuries, injuries that have limited their functional capacity and that, to date, have no hope of further recovery. This will also be directly relevant to our aging Veteran population, many of whom experience decreasing muscle strength and increasing muscle stiffness, limiting their normal activities. Our goal is to develop a therapeutic approach to muscle tissue repair based upon a deep understanding of the basic stem cell biology and a firm commitment to the clinical/translational mission to improve the health and quality of life of Veterans whose function is limited by the lack of effective therapeutic options."
"9266292","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT?AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES GROUP   Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement, the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology and  Transplantation (DAIT) intends to consolidate its funding for multiple, independent Statistical and Clinical  Coordinating Centers (SACCCs) into a single multi-component cooperative agreement, presumably to reduce  costs and increase efficiency and standardization across research consortia. This new program will fund a  single SACCC or Center to support DAIT research in the areas of asthma and allergic diseases, autoimmune  diseases, and transplantation, and in the area of autoimmune diseases research, this Center will provide  support to 3 consortia?the Autoimmunity Centers of Excellence (ACE), Hematopoietic Stem Cell Therapy  Consortium (HSCTC), and the autoimmune diseases component of the Immune Tolerance Network (ITN).  Within the Center, support for these 3 consortia will be organized under 1 group?the Autoimmune Diseases  Group (ADG). The objective of the ADG is to provide excellent and efficient study coordination support  services across the 3 autoimmune diseases research consortia. To accomplish this objective, RhoFED aims to  (1) provide staff experienced in autoimmune disease research conducted by DAIT-supported consortia and to  organize these staff in an administrative structure that manages resources efficiently, is responsive to the  needs of the research consortia and DAIT, and facilitates communication and collaboration; (2) provide  experienced scientists and statisticians who, in collaboration with clinical investigators and senior DAIT  officials, design and analyze studies across the full scope of research in autoimmune diseases; (3) facilitate the  development, review, and revision of initial and successive drafts of protocols and protocol-related documents  through dedicated ADG protocol teams; and (4) provide study initiation and study management functions that  are required for the efficient and ethical conduct of studies. Because RhoFED is currently the SACCC for ACE,  HSCT, and the Statistical Data Coordinating Center (SDCC) for ITN, RhoFED is well suited to provide  consolidated SACCC support across the 3 consortia. And, by providing staff with experience in supporting  autoimmune disease research and an administrative infrastructure designed to enhance collaboration between  parties and support agile and effective resource management, we believe that support of these 3 consortia  through the newly formed Center and the ADG will directly contribute to the achievement of the DAIT objective  to better understand, treat, and prevent autoimmune diseases."
"9214134","Project Summary/Abstract Dementia represents one of the most important public health concerns to affect us in the coming decades. Among the most important research goals will be to identify the earliest, most reliable and easily obtainable markers of degeneration, because early identification of individuals most likely to decline now represents the most promising window for therapeutic interventions. We propose to examine pupillary responses as a novel early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease (AD) pathogenesis and staging. Unlike neuroimaging and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, pupillary responses can be measured in as little as 5 minutes using a minimally-invasive, inexpensive, simple handheld device that could potentially enjoy widespread utility for screening in the context of a typical doctor's office visit. Pupil dilation recorded during simple cognitive tasks (e.g., digit span) provides a biomarker of the extent of cognitive effort or resource allocation required to achieve a given test score. Pupillary responses may be more sensitive to cognitive decline, because clinically meaningful declines in test scores become manifest only when the capacity to compensate is exceeded. If one person requires more effort to achieve the same score as another, that person is likely to be closer to maximum compensatory capacity and, therefore, is at higher risk for decline. Equally important, pupillary responses reflect locus coeruleus (LC) functioning, and postmortem studies implicate the LC as an early site of AD pathogenesis and degenerative changes with disease progression. Thus, pupillary responses may serve as a specific biomarker of functional alterations in a brain system affected by the earliest manifestations of AD. The proposed study will evaluate a model of LC system alterations across the aging-mild cognitive impairment (MCI)-AD continuum using (1) an innovative pupillometric evaluation of the functional integrity of the LC system, (2) examination of the structural integrity of the LC using recently-developed novel MRI methods, (3) a panel of CSF AD biomarkers (A?, P-tau, and total tau) anchoring participants to the existing pathophysiology involved in AD progression, and (4) innovative diagnostic and staging approaches to characterize the timeline of changes across the aging-MCI-AD continuum. Specifically, we propose to record pupillary responses during cognitive tasks, collect gold-standard CSF biomarkers of AD, and use an innovative MRI methodology to visualize neuromelanin-containing LC nuclei in 128 cognitively-normal (CN) individuals, 64 participants with amnestic MCI (aMCI), and 20 with AD. The specific aims are to determine whether pupillary responses are associated with early risk and staging of AD and whether pupillary responses are associated with LC neuronal degeneration on MRI across the aging-MCI-AD continuum. We predict that the relationship between pupillary responses and risk and progression of AD will be curvilinear following an inverted-U function, such that preclinical individuals at greater risk for AD and aMCI individuals will show compensatory effort (greater pupil dilation), but with advancing disease and greater LC dysfunction, compensatory capacity will be overloaded, resulting in decline in pupil dilation in AD."
"9416752","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Single ventricle congenital heart disease (SV) is the leading cause of cardiovascular death and indication for heart transplantation in infancy. SV comprises a spectrum of cyanotic congenital cardiac malformations that are defined by hypoxia and a univentricular circulation. These defects are universally fatal without intervention and despite advances in medical and surgical therapies, the 1-year survival for SV in the current era is only 68.7%. While the single ventricle can be a morphologic right ventricle (RV), left ventricle (LV) or of mixed morphology, it is the single RV lesions that have the worst outcome, presumably due to inherent limitations in the RV's ability to tolerate increased afterload. When a single RV serves as the sole pump to both the systemic and pulmonary circulations, not surprisingly, failure of the RV is both a common cause of death and indication for heart transplant in these patients. There are currently no proven therapies for SV heart failure and identification of targeted therapies specific to the failing SV are needed in order to improve outcomes. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors (PDE5i), such as sildenafil, are used for the treatment of primary pulmonary hypertension in children due to their proven vasodilatory effects. Over the past few years, use of PDE5i in those with SV HF has increased dramatically with the intention of lowering pulmonary vascular resistance, increasing pulmonary venous return to the heart and subsequently improving cardiac output. Sildenafil has been associated with improved hemodynamics, exercise tolerance and myocardial function by echo in small series of SV patients. While the stated target of therapy in SV patients is the pulmonary vascular bed, there is increasing evidence in adults and animal models of HF that PDE5i has beneficial myocardial remodeling and functional effects. Whether the beneficial effects of PDE5i in the SV population specifically are related to afterload reduction of the failing SV, direct myocardial effects or a combination of both is unknown. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that PDE5i has direct myocardial effects in SV that result in augmented cardiac function, effects on cGMP-regulated signaling pathways and altered sarcomeric protein phosphorylation. Due to difficulties performing research in the vulnerable pediatric population in vivo, the current application utilize an ongoing explanted human heart tissue bank and a cell culture model to address the specific aims, thereby minimizing risk to children. We will analyze the effect of PDE5i on myofibril mechanics and sarcomere phosphorylation as well as force generation in trabeculae from explanted SV hearts. The current application will be the first to determine myocardial effects of PDE5i in explanted pediatric SV hearts and begin to correlate molecular findings with function. Finally, we will use pharmacologic and genetic methods to investigate the intracellular effects of PDE5i in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVMs)."
"9375549","PROJECT SUMMARY Within the general population, women are at increased risk for developing anxiety-related disorders. Many of these mental health disorders are linked to times of hormonal fluctuations (puberty, pre-menstrual disorder, pregnancy, menopause). However, some of these life events (reproductive experience/pregnancy/child rearing) may be beneficial, producing persistent decreases in stress responsiveness that far outlast the post-partum and weaning periods. While much research is focused on mechanisms that cause stress-related disorders, few studies have examined the neural circuits associated with resilience. The long-term goal of this research is to elucidate the brain pathways and mechanisms involved in the establishment and maintenance of stress resilience. While our research team has advanced the understanding of how neuropeptide Y (NPY) works as an anxiolytic compound in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) of male rats, the assessment of stress resilience cannot be complete without identifying the generation of resilience in females. The studies outlined here focus on the role of NPY in establishing stress resilience in females both via injection of the peptide into the amygdala and through endogenous release in a naturally-occurring model of resilience (reproductive experience; RE). We postulate that administration of NPY into the BLA will induce behavioral stress resilience in naïve female rats and that this will be accompanied by alterations in BLA neuronal excitability, decreases in ion channel expression and altered BLA neuronal morphology associated with decreased anxiety; a cellular ?signature? that was observed in male rats. To examine whether NPY participates in physiologically-induced resilience, we will use a model of RE (uniparous females rearing one litter), a life experience that increases stress resistance, to assess anxiety-related behaviors and properties of BLA neurons in ex vivo slice preparations. We will also examine gene expression of ion channels and neuropeptide receptors associated with stress resilience, as well as whether blockade of NPY Y5 receptors inhibits the generation of this resilience. The work proposed here will expand the stress resilient role of NPY, and the effects of RE on similar mechanisms (alteration of H currents) to produce stress resilience. While these studies examine mechanisms underlying resilience, the results can also inform future studies of postpartum depression and sex differences in treatment of anxiety disorders. The contribution of the Y5R subtype to the generation of resilience in two different models will be particularly informative in identifying a mechanism and novel target for anxiety treatment."
"9268544","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term goal of this project is to better understand the contribution of soluble form(s) of alpha-synuclein (?Syn) in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Our recently published findings suggest that (i) intraneuronal soluble ?Syn is abnormally elevated in AD brains in absence of deposited ?Syn, (ii) soluble ?Syn is a quantitatively better correlate of cognitive function than soluble amyloid-beta (Aß) and tau in humans, (iii) overexpression of ?Syn leads to cognitive impairment in mice, (iv) elevation of ?Syn leads to decreases in selected synaptic vesicle proteins and an alteration of the protein composition of synaptic vesicles and (v) a synergism between Aß/APP and human tau appears to be responsible for the abnormal elevation of soluble ?Syn in transgenic mice.  In this study, we propose to determine whether soluble non-fibrillar forms of ?Syn are modulating cognitive decline in mice and to unravel the synaptic mechanism by which ?Syn might be impairing memory. The overall objective of this application is to identify the role of soluble ?Syn molecule(s) and its(their) relative contribution(s) to AD. Altogether, our observations suggest that AD might not be a two-protein disorder (i.e. Aß and tau) but instead a three-pronged attack of neuronal synapses by Aß, tau and soluble ?Syn. To test this provocative hypothesis, three questions regrouped under three aims are proposed: 1) Does deleting the ?Syn gene SNCA from APP mice improve behavior, pathology and synaptic vesicle composition? 2) What form(s) of soluble ?Syn is/are associated with cognitive impairment in brains of ?Syn transgenic animals and in subjects with AD? 3) What is the mechanism(s) by which soluble ?Syn species alter presynaptic vesicle composition?"
"9268672","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung disease originating in the period of alveologenesis, between the limit of viability and early childhood, remains a major cause of illness and death. Research to discover novel treatments for these disorders is limited by the rarity of access to normal and diseased human lung in this age group. The University of Rochester Medical Center (URMC) submits this application in response to NHLBI RFA-HL-14-007 requesting proposals to enter into a cooperative agreement (U01) to serve as the Human Tissue Core (HTC) for the Molecular Atlas of Lung Development Program (LungMAP). It will be the responsibility of the HTC to identify and manage tissue source sites to collect the necessary tissues to meet the overall goal of this program which is, as stated in the RFA, to build an open-access reference resource by creating a comprehensive molecular atlas of the late-stage developing lung with data and reagents available to the research community. The atlas will integrate gene and protein expression profiles, transcriptome, epigenome, and other molecular characterizations with high-resolution anatomical information to provide molecular profiles of functionally or anatomically defined cell types in the developing lung. As the HTC, URMC will collect, process, deposit, and distribute normal late fetal and early childhood human lung samples to four LungMAP Research Centers (RCs). Because of the concern and complexity in recovering the lungs in a standardized manner and with as little ischemia-induced artifact as possible, and the need to meet all legal and ethical standards, we have chosen to work through elements of the United Network of Organ Sharing, the non-profit organization that manages the nation's federally contracted Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN). Specifically, we have chosen to work with two non-profit organizations to whom are referred non-transplantable donated organs suitable for research, The National Disease Research Interchange (NDRI) and the International Institute for the Advancement of Medicine (IIAM). NDRI and IIAM are committed to working with the OPTN and with families who approach them because of a pregnancy that is expected to result in a perinatal death. We at URMC will prepare the donated organs to meet the needs of the RCs; at minimum we are prepared to obtain cone beam CT scans for evaluation of total volume, vascular and airway structure, prepare fixed, embedded and sectioned tissue and isolate specific cell populations by tissue dissociation and flow activated cell sorting. A working group of highly qualified Pathologists will consult for the HTC, to develop standard biorepository and assessment tools and to review specimens to assure quality and normality of the tissues chosen for study. We will work closely with the DCC to assure compatible data systems and ultimate open access to the collected data. We will also, from the inception, develop plans for the continued preservation and availability of these rare samples following the primary LungMAP funding. (End of Abstract)"
"9172614","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Due to sustained military conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq over the past decade, there are an increasing number of U.S. military personnel and Veterans returning home with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and comorbid alcohol use disorders (AUD). If left untreated, Veterans with co-occurring PTSD and substance use disorders are at increased risk for developing other mental health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety), suicidal ideation and attempts, physical health problems, reduced resiliency and military readiness, employment problems, violence, and family/relationship impairment. While mental health services are in place for U.S. service members, substantial gaps in the treatment of co-occurring PTSD and AUD exist and there is little scientific evidence available to guide the provision of care. The proposed study directly addresses this critical knowledge gap by testing the efficacy of doxazosin, a long-acting and selective alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, as compared to placebo in reducing PTSD and AUD severity among U.S. military personnel who have served in Operation Enduring Freedom, Operation Iraqi Freedom, or Operation New Dawn (OEF/OIF/OND). The most common substance use disorder among Veterans is alcohol use disorder (AUD); thus the proposed study targets Veterans with co-occurring PTSD and AUD. The medication to be investigated (doxazosin) represents a novel treatment approach for PTSD/AUD. While prazosin, also an alpha-1 adrenergic antagonist, has been shown to improve sleep and nightmares in military personnel with PTSD and may help reduce substance use severity, it has a short half-life of 2-3 hours and requires multiple doses each day, which is a significant limitation. In several pilot studies, doxazosin has shown promise in significantly reducing symptoms of PTSD and AUD and, in contrast to prazosin, it requires once per day dosing which confers a significant advantage in terms of translating positive findings into routine clinical practice. In this Stage I study, we will (1) employ a two-arm randomized, double-blind, between-groups experimental design that will consist of 12 weeks of treatment with doxazosin or placebo medication; (2) use standardized, repeated dependent measures to rigorously assess PTSD symptomatology and AUD severity at 5 time points (baseline, week 4, week 8, week 12 and 1-month follow-up); (3) measure impairment in associated mental and behavioral health problems (e.g., depression, anxiety, sleep, risky behaviors, family/social functioning); and (4) use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the underlying pathophysiology of comorbid PTSD/AUD and identify prognostic indicators of treatment outcome. To achieve these aims, we have assembled a multidisciplinary team of investigators with nationally-recognized expertise in combat-related PTSD, substance use disorders and neuroimaging who have successfully collaborated in the past and are uniquely qualified to implement this type of investigation. The investigators represent a collaboration of faculty at the Ralph H. Johnson Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center and the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) in Charleston, SC. The proposed project is directly responsive to the mission of the Consortium to Alleviate PTSD (CAP) in that it seeks to enhance and accelerate research on the treatment of early, chronic and latent onset PTSD and common comorbidities such as AUD. The findings of this study will provide critically needed empirical evidence to help inform clinical practice guidelines and better  serve the needs of U.S. service members, Veterans and their families."
"9274918","The proposed study is a cross-sectional and longitudinal, repeated measure, case-control multi- site study of Veterans with a history of OEF-OIF combat exposure. The purpose of this research is to examine the potential late-life effects of mTBI including possible neurodegenerative disorders such as CTE. The overall goals of this proposed large, longitudinal cohort study of Veterans with and without mTBI after OEF-OIF combat exposure are to (1) disentangle the role of mTBI(s) in their later life outcomes including but not limited to neurodegeneration, and (2) seek converging behavioral and biological evidence for CTE. The facilities engaged in recruiting and enrolling participants are McGuire VAMC in Richmond, James Haley VAMC in Tampa, South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio, and Michael DeBakey VAMC in Houston. To achieve these aims, all subjects will undergo an initial comprehensive assessment to determine the prevalence, type, and intensity of residual symptoms and impairments potentially attributable to TBI. Individuals with a history of TBI will be compared to controls with combat exposure and no history of TBI. All subjects will then undergo periodic (three years follow up and then every five years), in-person and annual telephonic reassessment to monitor the status of their condition and to assess for evidence of biologic, behavioral, cognitive, neurologic, and functional changes. In this way, the functional and biologic late effects of mTBI and their potential neurodegenerative decline over time will be delineated. In addition to descriptive statistics, the cross-sectional study will assess the association of mTBI and time from injury to current status while adjusting for multiple covariates including age and PTSD. The testing of differences between mTBI and controls will be powered by the primary outcome, cognitive function. Other outcome measures were assembled to measure all potential moderators of mTBI outcome and to track longitudinally the broad range of potential biologic markers, symptoms, impairments, comorbidities and disability known to be associated with TBI outcome and those purportedly linked to neurodegeneration. Physiologic, anatomic, and biologic tests posited to identify preclinical neurodegeneration will be conducted in parallel with cognitive testing; physical and sensory performance measures; and psychological, functional, disability, and global outcome measures. Criteria for participation This study of 1,100 combat-exposed OEF-OIF Veterans is expected to yield approximately 880 participants (80%) with at least one mTBI and 220 participants (20%) without any history of mTBI (referred to as controls). The inclusion criteria are (1) a history of OEF-OIF combat tour, and (2) a Combat Exposure Scale (CES) score > 1 on any item (light or higher). Thus, to ensure that cases and controls have similar environmental history, all participants will have exposure to stressful combat situations during OEF-OIF. All persons regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity will be included. Those with history of moderate or severe TBI, or other major neurologic disorder, will be excluded."
"9288096","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic and progressive movement disorder characterized by the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and presence of Lewy body. Clinically, PD is characterized by resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and postural instability. Inflammatory responses manifested by glia, T cell infiltration, and increased expression of inflammatory toxic mediators in the glial and neuronal cells, are prominent features of PD. Neuroinflammation is an important contributor to the pathogenesis of PD and may further augment progressive loss of nigral dopaminergic neurons. Approximately one million Americans are living with PD. At present, the annual combined direct and indirect cost of healthcare for PD patients is estimated to be nearly $25 billion in the USA. However, the etiology of PD remains unknown; and though there is currently no cure, but there are treatment options available such as medication and surgery to manage its symptoms. The lack of treatments for the progressive phase of PD represents a significant gap in the clinician's ability to treat this disease. The goal of this proposal is to study the role of glia maturation factor (GMF), a novel protein first discovered in our laboratory at the University of Iowa, in the activation of mast cells and secretion of proinflammatory mediators that are responsible for neurodegeneration in the pathogenesis of PD. Emerging evidence suggests glia-neuron-mast cell communications in neuroinflammatory conditions. We hypothesize that GMF-dependent activation of mast cell is associated with the pathophysiology of PD. We will elucidate the regulatory role of GMF in degeneration of neurons in order to provide a mechanistic basis for GMF-mediated pathogenesis in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6- tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) mouse model of PD. We will examine whether GMF is required in human and mouse primary mast cell activation and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines/chemokines and free radical that are responsible for degeneration of dopaminergic neurons following parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4- phenyl-pyridinium ion (MPP+) treatment in in vitro studies. We will analyze the mechanistic pathways involved in the activation of mast cells by GMF. Next, we will investigate if GMF exerts its effects by modulating mast cells in degeneration of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons in mouse models of PD. For this purpose we will use both MPTP-induced acute and chronic mouse models. We will reconstitute mast cell deficient (W/Wv) mice with bone marrow-derived mast cells from GMF-deficient (GMFKO) mice or Wild type mice and challenge with MPTP. We will analyze MPTP-induced neuroinflammation, neurochemical deficits, nigrostriatal degeneration, and correlate with behavioral parameters in these animal models. The present study has significant clinical implications, and provides an efficient in vivo approach to test GMF- suppression strategies as therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative diseases, including PD."
"9275369","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The goal of this project is to develop a nanomicelle drug delivery system that can specifically target bladder cancer. With the funding of the VA Career Development Award-2 (CDA-2, PI: Pan), a bladder cancer-targeting ligand named PLZ4 was developed. PLZ4 binds to both human and dog bladder cancer cell lines and cancer cells from clinical specimens, suggesting that the pre-clinical studies can be performed in dogs with spontaneous bladder cancer. PLZ4 does not bind to normal urothelial cells, inflamed bladder cells, blood cells, vascular endothelial cells an fibroblasts. Recently, Kit Lam, MD, PhD, (Dr. Pan's VA CDA-2 mentor) developed biocompatible and biodegradable nanomicelles.  Chemotherapeutic and imaging agents can be loaded inside the nanomicelles. When they are decorated with PLZ4 on surface, these targeting nanomicelles together with the drug load are delivered into bladder cancer cells. Targeting PLZ4-nanomicelles preferentially concentrate at the bladder cancer xenograft sites in vivo and can significantly prolong survival when compared to non-targeting nanomicelles. In this project, we will optimize the structure of the PLZ4-nanomicelles to achieve the maximal drug loading and delivery, and determine the in vivo targeting and drug distribution in mice carrying bladder cancer xenografts developed from human clinical specimens. A pilot study will be conducted in dog patients carrying spontaneous bladder cancer in order to obtain the preliminary toxicity and efficacy data."
"9274911","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         These goals of this study are to identify the mutations that give rise to inherited Mendelian neurodegenerative disorders in five categories (spastic paraplegia, neuromuscular disorders, movement disorders, ataxia, and non-Alzheimer dementia) and to investigate how these mutations lead to disease. During the past 5 years, there has been a fundamental shift in the approach to gene discovery from linkage analysis-based positional cloning to mutational cloning, made possible by technologies and analysis equipment that perform massively parallel sequencing of DNA. This new approach also relies on the success of the Human Genome Project that provided a template against which to compare the sequences obtained from any individual. Because the great majority of genetic diseases are caused by mutations that affect the protein sequence, this research focuses on the exome, the complete protein- coding region of the genome. The challenge of mutational cloning is to identify a pathogenic mutation in the background of thousands of benign protein changing variations in individual exomes. The proposed approach combines linkage or identity-by-descent (IBD) analysis to identify genomic regions shared by all affected family members and exome sequencing of several affected relatives to identify the variants they share in the IBD region. Advances in bioinformatics offer a stepwise filtering approach to select the likely pathogenic variants to study further. Cosegregation of the variant with disease in single families and identification of mutations in the same gene in other families provide validation that the gene is responsible for the disease. In vitro studies of the effect of the mutation on the function of the gene will be done when possible. The research takes advantage of the large collection of samples from many families ascertained, extensively characterized, and extended over the past 25 years. Continued subject accrual is a unifying feature of the proposed research; new disorders are identified, panels of subjects are developed for disease-gene verification, and genotype/phenotype correlations can be determined. Beyond the implication of gene discovery for patients who suffer from a particular disorder, each new gene contributes to our understanding of the complex protein-protein interactions involved in maintenance of the neurologic system and pathways of neurodegeneration. The findings of this research will be an important part of a systematic approach to diagnosis and the eventual treatment and prevention of these diseases."
"9275411","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The wars waged by the US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan span more than a decade. Over this period more than 2.4 million US military personnel have deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq and for whom repetitive combat exposure to high explosives has been a common occurrence. Detonation of high explosives can inflict brain injury by multiple means. Even in the absence of direct blunt impacts to the head from flying objects or appreciable acceleration/deceleration of the head, the primary shock wave or blast overpressure (BOP) generated by high explosives is capable of injuring the brain. It is becoming increasingly clear that repetitive mild traumatic bran injury (mTBI) experienced by boxers and football players is associated with chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) that is evidenced upon autopsy by significant tau and glial pathology; and which shares important similarities to several other chronic neurodegenerative diseases. Importantly, TBI increases the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD). There is growing evidence that repetitive blast exposure may similarly place US combat service members and Veterans at risk for also developing CTE- related neurodegenerative disorders.  Thus, there is an urgent need to better understand the nature of brain injuries caused by repetitive BOP. Currently, the mechanisms and pathophysiology underlying mild blast exposure on the brain are not well- understood. In particular the role played by astrocytes-which are crucial in protecting the brain from CNS insults-is largely unknown with regards to mild blast-induced mTBI. In addition, the relationship between blast-induced pathologic tau expression and astrocyte pathology remains to be explored. These gaps in our mechanistic understanding currently impede the search for new ways to ameliorate the risk of blast-induced mTBI from developing into a progressive neurodegenerative disorder.  We have established a murine model of BOP-induced mTBI that is in keeping with well-established and validated approaches that accurately mimics battlefield-relevant open-field explosions. Using this approach we have found evidence that mild blast exposure provokes increased pathologically-related phospho-tau and loss of several important astrocytic molecules that play critical roles in preventing CNS toxicity; specifically the glutamate transporters GLT-1/EAAT2, GLAST/EAAT1, and glutamine synthetase (GS) that is responsible for detoxifying glutamate and recycling it into glutamine.  In this project we will test the following hypotheses: (i) that mild repetitive blast exposure give rie to long lasting disturbances in astrocyte function that impair the ability of the brain to clear an metabolize the neurotransmitter glutamate; (ii) that loss of GLT-1/EAAT2 will render the brain more susceptible to blast- induced tau pathology, particularly in the context of repetitive BOP exposures; (iii) that mild blast exposure induces pathologic astrocytic dysmorphology that will be investigated using real-time in vivo imaging approaches; and (iv) that mild repetitive blast-induced astrocytic and tau pathology will give rise to cognitive and behavioral dysfunction.  Successful completion of the aims of this proposal will provide new insights into the mechanisms by which repetitive blast-related mTBI harms the brain and facilitate the search for new strategies to reduce the long- term health risks associated with repetitive blast exposure."
"9305822","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Health outcomes in the United States lag behind other developed nations despite health expenditures that are exceptionally high and growing. This disparity has led many to conclude that healthcare services are overused, a phenomenon driven by a perfect storm of patient, provider, and institutional determinants. Overuse has been defined as the provision of care in circumstances where the potential for harm exceeds the potential for benefit. While overuse is pervasive throughout the healthcare system, older Americans may be particularly at risk for receipt of services where the potential for harm exceeds the potential for benefit. This may include the use of screening tests when there are conditions causing substantial competing risks for death, therapies delivered at end-of-life that do not impact disease course or quality of life, therapies delivered without recognition of the heterogeneity among older patients due to frailty, polypharmacy in multimorbid patients, and care coordination failure when multiple specialists are involved in care. Overuse of healthcare puts patients at risks of adverse outcomes and has system-wide consequences, and yet this is poorly appreciated by patients, their families, and their clinicians. I seek this K24 award to support my effort as a researcher and mentor of talented young investigators as we work to understand overuse of healthcare and advance the practice of parsimonious medicine, a term reflecting the prudent delivery of care necessary for the patient's good. The overarching aim of this career development award is to work towards harm reduction for older patients through parsimonious healthcare use, and concurrently, advance my skills in patient centered outcomes research and train the next generation of researchers in this field. With my mentees, mentors, and colleagues, I will: a) systematically review the literature about determinants of overuse of healthcare resources; b) conduct a qualitative study via focus groups to understand how patients perceive overuse and its harms; c) use stated-preference methods to understand how older patients make decisions about their use of healthcare and how this varies in the presence of geriatric syndromes, and d) validate the Johns Hopkins Index of Overuse with additional data sources and explore the impact of Accountable Care Organization establishment on overuse of resources in older patients. The impact of this award is expected to be the completion of important research to inform the care of older adults, the advancement of a cohort of young investigators with skills to address these topics and others relevant to improved care delivery, and the personal advancement of my skills so that I can be an ever more effective researcher and mentor."
"9275385","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Tobacco use and prevalence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are significantly higher among veterans than non-veteran population. Airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling is the most critical process in the pathogenesis of COPD. Large amounts of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are released from activated inflammatory cells and other lung cells in COPD or from tobacco smoke (TS) per se. ROS are implicated in the development of airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling. However, little has been known about how ROS and TS lead to these pathological alterations. We have found that ROS and TS activates calpain in bronchial and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells (BSMCs and PASMCs) and that calpain mediates cell proliferation and collagen-I synthesis in PASMCs. Calpain is a family of calcium-dependent non- lysosomal neutral cysteine endopeptidases that act via limited proteolysis of substrate proteins in mammalian cells, including BSMCs and PASMCs. We have recently reported for the first time that global inhibition of calpain prevents pulmonary vascular remodeling induced by chronic hypoxia and monocrotaline. In preliminary experiments, we found that the specific calpain inhibitor, MDL28170, prevented ROS-induced increases in cell proliferation and protein levels of collagen-I in BSMCs and PASMCs. Transforming growth factor (TGF)/Smad pathway have been shown to play important roles in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling. We have reported that calpain activates TGF1 by cleaving latent TGF1. This proposal is to study a novel hypothesis that calpain mediates ROS- and TS-induced cell proliferation and collagen synthesis in airway and pulmonary vascular smooth muscle cells via activation of intracellular TGF1 in TS-induced COPD. The protein and activity of calpain, cell proliferation and collagen synthesis will be determined in BSMCs and PASMCs with or without treatment of H2O2 and TS. Calpain activity will be manipulated using specific inhibitor, siRNA and over-expression of calpastatin genes. A novel intracrine TGF1 pathway will be studied in H2O2- and TS-treated cells. Moreover, the role of calpain in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling will be evaluated in a COPD animal model using innovative inducible global and smooth muscle-specific calpain knockout mouse line. Finally, calpain will be pharmacologically targeted using a specific calpain inhibitor MDL28170 in a TS-induced COPD rat model. This proposal is novel because it will identify calpain as a mediator in airway and pulmonary vascular remodeling and calpain serves this role by activating intracellular TGF1 in BSMCs and PASMCs. A better understanding of the mechanistic insight will provide a strong rationale for manipulating calpain activities in the treatment of lung diseases such as COPD, pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. Completion of this project will help find novel treatments for COPD and in turn improve the life and care of veterans."
"9269955","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Chronic, low-grade inflammation is a contributing factor to most age-related human diseases. However, the molecular mechanisms that sustain chronic inflammatory responses during aging remain poorly understood making it difficult to treat this deleterious condition. Over the past few years, studies have indicated that mammalian noncoding microRNAs (miRNAs) regulate a variety of acute inflammatory responses in young mice. We hypothesize that miRNAs also play critical roles in gauging inflammation during the aging process. Consistent with this, removal of miR-146a has recently been shown to cause an age-dependent inflammatory disease that recapitulates many aspects of chronic inflammation in patients, including progression to life-shortening disorders like cancer. We have used the miR-146a-/- model to identify and study other miRNAs that promote age-related inflammation, and have determined that miR-155 is necessary for disease to emerge in the miR-146a-/- mouse model. We have also found that miR-155 is required for spontaneous accumulation of T follicular helper cells, autoantibody production and the subsequent tissue inflammation that emerges in middle-aged miR-146a-/- mice. Further, we also have preliminary data indicating a T cell-intrinsic role for miR-155 as it promotes chronic inflammation in miR-146a-/- mice. We will carry out a research plan to determine which downstream phenotypes in miR-146a-/- are dependent on miR-155 function in T cells, and also determine the specific contribution by Tfh cells. The molecular mechanism by which miR-155 instructs Tfh cell development in miR-146a-/- mice will also be investigated. Furthermore, we will extend our studies into the clinic and determine if miR-155 and Tfh cell levels correlate with other markers of chronic, low-grade inflammation in healthy middle aged patients. Taken together, our research plan will provide valuable insight into the mechanisms underlying chronic inflammation, and determine whether miR-155 and Tfh cells are promising therapeutic targets with the potential to reduce chronic, low-grade inflammation and the myriad of diseases that stem from this pathological condition."

"9482498","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this proposal is to translate basic, epidemiologic, and technologic discoveries into new strategies to prevent healthcare-associated transmission of Ebola and other high-consequence pathogens. Healthcare-associated transmission of high-consequence pathogens such as the Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus, MERS coronavirus, novel respiratory pathogens, multidrug resistant bacteria, and Clostridium difficile poses a significant risk to patients, families, and healthcare workers (HCWs), leading to morbidity and mortality and dramatically increased healthcare costs. Recent experience with Ebola has shown that current infection prevention strategies may be inadequate to prevent transmission of high-consequence pathogens in healthcare settings. Using our broad experience and expertise and our history of successful collaboration, we propose a multifaceted and innovative framework integrating infection prevention, human factors engineering, and mathematical modeling approaches to address knowledge gaps in current infection prevention methods and to develop new interventions to prevent the transmission of high-consequence pathogens in healthcare settings. We hypothesize that: 1) self-contamination of HCW while doffing personal protective equipment (PPE) can be prevented by elucidating risk factors for HCW self-contamination and designing effective risk mitigation strategies to prevent HCW self-contamination events, 2) pathogen transmission from environmental sources can be effectively prevented by elucidating specific risk factors in environmental service (EVS) worker training, communication, culture and processes and designing effective interventions to optimize environmental cleaning and disinfection, 3) mathematical modeling will improve understanding of how resistance mechanisms impact transmission routes of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaciae (CRE) in healthcare settings and the effectiveness of contact precautions for the prevention of CRE transmission. We will apply human factors and mathematical modeling (T0) approaches to gather data on risk factors and potential failure modes that contribute to pathogen transmission during HCW PPE doffing, EVS cleaning and disinfection of the environment, and the care of patients who are colonized or infected with CRE. We will then use the identified risk factors and epidemiologic transmission data to develop (T1), implement (T2) and assess new strategies within a large tertiary care hospital and across a health system of hospitals (T3). In addition to our expertise in infection prevention surveillance, intervention trils, and antimicrobial stewardship, in this proposal we demonstrate our capacity to integrate distinct scientific disciplines and introduce novel applications of evidence-based risk mitigation strategies to expand the science of infection prevention. The findings from this proposal will inform CDC guidance for frontline HCWs by providing concise and practical, evidence-based recommendations to prevent pathogen transmission in order to reduce harm to patients and healthcare workers."
"9275392","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Coronary heart disease is the single leading cause of death among men and women in the United States. Coronary revascularization, including coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) and percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the most common modality in patients with coronary diseases. However, it is also among the most costly, and is often associated with a high incidence of restenosis. Although the rate of restenosis is significantly reduced with the use of bare-metal stent (BMS) and particularly with drug-eluting stent (DES), a persistently high rate of restenosis after BMS and an increased risk of in-stent thrombosis with DES have been encountered as significant limitations to the long-term efficacy of coronary revascularization. With a long-term goal of identifying novel therapeutic targets for coronary heart disease, the current application specifically investigates a potentially critical role of calcium independent phospholipase A2b (iPLA2b) in vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation in a mouse femoral artery wire injury model. iPLA2b is a member of the phospholipase A2 superfamily that acts on phospholipids to produce a free fatty acid and a lysophospholipid. iPLA2b is expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) and is implicated in many human diseases. Whereas little is known about the role of other PLA2 in vascular injury-induced neointima formation, substantial evidence, including pharmacological inhibition, antisense oligonucleotide down- rgulation, genetic deletion, and smooth muscle-specific overexpression, consistently demonstrated that iPLA2b plays a critical role in vascular inflammation and neointima formation in a mouse carotid artery ligation model. To investigate whether targeting smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b is sufficient to reduce vascular inflammation and neointima formation, a femoral artery injury model that better mimics PCI was established, a novel tamoxifen-inducible smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b knockout mouse model (SM-iPLA2b-iKO) was developed, and the current proposal hypothesizes that activation of iPLA2b in VSMC by vascular injury plays a key role in wire injury-induced vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation, thereby significantly contributing to the development of restenosis after coronary revascularization. Three Specific Aims are:  1) To test the hypothesis that smooth muscle-specific iPLA2b plays a critical role in the initiation of vascular inflammation, re-endothelialization, and neointima formation; 2) To determine the molecular mechanism that underlies wire injury-induced iPLA2b activation, vascular inflammation, and neointima formation; 3) To investigate whether post-wire injury molecular and genetic targeting iPLA2b has an effect on the progression of re-endothelialization, vascular inflammation, and neointima formation. To achieve this goal, a well established and most physiological relevant femoral artery wire injury model will be used in combination with several novel and established genetic animal models (SM- iPLA2b-iKO, SM-HIF-1a-iKO, and SM-iPLA2b-Tg/12/15-LO) to selectively inhibit or activate iPLA2b, HIF-1a, and 12/15-LO before and after wire injury. Injured and non-injured femoral arteries will be isolated and then subjected to molecular, immunohistological, and biochemical studies to determine the role of iPLA2b in vascular inflammation and neointima formation. Results from the proposed studies may modify the current paradigm that the initiation and early progression of vascular inflammation are largely attributed to coordinated interactions among monocytes/macrophages, leukocytes, and endothelial cells by providing the first direct experimental evidence that VSMC also play a critical role in these early key events. Importantly, results from the proposed studies will elucidate specific mechanisms that could lead to the identification of iPLA2b as a novel potential therapeutic target for the prevention and treatment of vascular inflammation, re- endothelialization, neointima formation, and restenosis."
"9275404","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Acquired long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a potentially lethal cardiac condition that can be caused by medications and is also associated with diabetes mellitus. The prevalence of QT prolongation is higher in the diabetic vs. the non-diabetic population, and QT prolongation is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular death in diabetic patients. A major recent advance in cancer treatment has been the development of targeted therapies that inhibit tyrosine kinases, phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks), and other signaling molecules that play critical roles in carcinogenesis. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have significantly improved patient survival for cancers such as chronic myeloid leukemia, and several PI3K inhibitors now in clinical trials also show promising anti-cancer activity. However, these drugs can cause LQTS. We investigated the origins of the LQTS induced by these drugs and discovered to our surprise that prolongation of the cardiac action potential duration (APD) was not due uniquely to a reduction in the repolarizing potassium current, IKr. Instead, as we recently reported in Science Translational Medicine, multiple currents (IKr, IKs, ICaL, and peak INa) were reduced, while long-lasting (persistent) sodium current (INaP) was increased. TKIs caused these effects by inhibiting PI3K signaling. It is well established that diabetes mellitus is associated with decreased PI3K signaling in insulin- responsive tissues, including the heart. Therefore, our main hypothesis is that low cardiac PI3K signaling in diabetes accentuates the risk of drug-induced LQTS. We will test this hypothesis using myocytes and hearts from two diabetic mouse models, as well as canine myocytes in which the insulin/PI3K signaling pathway is down-regulated. Conversely, we hypothesize that insulin activation of cardiac PI3K signaling ameliorates drug- induced LQTS. Our proposed studies will determine whether insulin/glucose/potassium infusion reverses drug- induced LQTS in vivo in dogs. Lastly, we hypothesize that there are multiple tyrosine kinases in addition to the insulin receptor that regulate the action potential in cardiac myocytes. We will us pharmacologic and shRNA strategies to identify all of the tyrosine kinases in canine cardiac myocytes that signal through PI3K to regulate the APD. This comprehensive approach will facilitate the development of safer TKIs that target specific kinases involved in carcinogenesis while avoiding effects on kinases that could cause LQTS. We believe that results from these proposed studies will lead to the development of breakthrough preventive and therapeutic strategies to counter this deadly cardiac condition."

"9220701","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Our microbiome influences how our immune system functions. Our microbiome has changed as a result of living in highly hygienic industrialized countries. A major change in our microbiome is loss of exposure to helminths (parasitic worms). Prior to the 1940's, helminth colonization was nearly universal and there is strong evidence that this exposure helped to shape our genome. Loss of these previously ubiquitous members of our paleobiome, can have far ranging immunologic effect. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) currently afflicts more than one million Americans and many thousands of veterans. The incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increased dramatically after the 1940's in North America and Europe. These diseases are rare in less developed tropical countries. Veterans that served in Vietnam or were prisoners of war are at lower risk of developing IBD than are other veterans. Moreover, as countries develop economically the incidence of IBD and other immune-mediated diseases increase. Thus, IBD is a globally emerging disorder. Although specific genes predispose to IBD, there is strong evidence that a change in environment concurrent with socioeconomic improvement confers risk for developing the disorder. We propose that a change from our historic paleobiome, the lack of helminth exposure, in developed countries is an important risk factor for developing IBD and other immune-mediated diseases. We and others have shown that colonization with helminths protects mice from immune-mediated colitis, encephalitis, diabetes, and airway disease. These are models of diseases that have emerged within highly industrialized countries. Understanding how helminth exposure decreases immune mediated diseases will guide development of targeted therapy to prevent or treat those diseases. Th17 cells control pro-inflammatory pathological responses, like that of IBD. Recently it has become clear that Th17 cells are heterogeneous. In addition to making IL17, highly pro-inflammatory Th17 cells make IFNy (Th17/Th1). Other Th17 cells with a regulatory phenotype express FoxP3 or make IL10 (Th17/Treg). Immune mediated disease likely results from dysregulated Th17 plasticity. We discovered that mucosal IL17 production is inhibited by exposure to helminths and that this exposure decreases Th17/Th1 and increases Th17/Treg percentages in lamina propria and mesenteric lymph node cell populations. Our hypothesis is that helminth exposure protects against colitis by altering Th17 heterogeneity/plasticity. This project will test this hypothesis wth 3 specific aims. Our first aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure that inhibit Th17/Th1 plasticity with focus on Stat6 signaling. Our second aim will explore the mechanisms enabled by helminth exposure that augment Th17/Treg plasticity. Our third aim will explore how changes in Th circuitry alters intestinal epithelial cell function with focus on epithelial cell pSTAT3 expression. Our research is unique in that we are exploring possible root causes for the emergence of autoimmune and immune-mediated inflammatory disease in modern civilizations. In addition, these studies will provide insight into how helminth-exposed individuals that live or served in less developed countries may respond to immunologic challenges. Furthermore, we are examining in vivo how infectious organisms alter immune pathways to influence chronic inflammatory diseases like those that afflict veterans."
"9275311","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The overall goal of this project is to determine the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy. Our exciting recent discoveries concerning the role of EGFR activation in diabetic nephropathy form the basis for our proposed studies. EGFR is expressed in both glomeruli and tubules in the kidney, and our recent studies implicate EGFR activation in development of both glomerulopathy and tubulointerstitial fibrosis in chronic kidney disease. We have found novel interactions of angiotensin II, EGFR and TGF-ss in progressive kidney disease. In mice subjected to chronic angiotensin II exposure, there is increased EGFR activation in kidney tubules. Strikingly, in mice treated with the selective EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor, erlotinib, or in floxed EGFR mice with selective deletion in proximal tubules, there is marked inhibition of the progressive tubulointerstitial fibrosis seen in the wild type mice exposed to the chronic angiotensin II infusion. Even more strikingly, the increased TGF-ss expression and Smad2/3 activation that occur in response to angiotensin II infusion are almost completely prevented when EGFR expression or activation is inhibited. Furthermore, our preliminary results indicate that there is persistent renal EGFR activation in mouse models of diabetes both in glomeruli and in tubules, and the increased diabetes-induced TGF-ss expression and receptor activation in the kidney are inhibited when EGFR expression or activation is blocked. We have also found increased glomerular and arteriolar expression of the EGFR ligand, HB-EGF. Our preliminary results indicate that either genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of EGFR signaling markedly slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy in murine models of diabetes. Therefore, the overriding aim of this grant is to determine whether EGFR and/or EGFR signaling pathways could be potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of diabetic kidney injury. We will address the role of the EGFR signaling in development and progression of diabetic glomerulopathy and tubulointerstitial injury in the following specific aims: Aim #1) Characterize the Role of Persistet EGFR Activation in Diabetic Glomerular and Tubular Injury (Determining mechanisms by which persistent EGFR activation mediates glomerular injury and the effects of inhibition of EGFR expression or activation on development of diabetic glomerulopathy; determining mechanisms underlying aberrant EGFR activation in the glomerulus in diabetic nephropathy; and determining mechanisms by which proximal tubule EGFR activation mediates progressive tubulointerstitial injury in diabetic nephropathy) and Aim #2) Identify the EGFR signaling pathways that play a deleterious role in development and progression of diabetic nephropathy."

"9275301","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The overall hypothesis that underlies the focus of this grant proposal is that chronic TH1/classical inflammation is critical for the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease (PD) and Gulf War Illnesses (GWI) and other neurodegenerative diseases. There is strong evidence from the literature that inflammation and oxidative damage are observed in the brains of PD patients, GWI patients and patients with other neurodegenerative diseases, however a critical question is the interaction of neurons, glia and T cells. Furthermore, there is mounting evidence that an during aging, there is development of a hostile environment that makes therapeutics that may be effective in the young animal, less effective in the aged animal. The aims of this proposal are designed to examine this process by following the progression of damage from wild-type (WT) ?-synuclein overexpressed in the substantia nigra via transduction with adeno-associated virus (AAV)9. We will study the role of inflammation in this model and determine if therapeutics effective in young animals are equally effective in the aged.  Specific Aim 1: Hypothesis: CX3CL1 (fractalkine) is a chemokine important in neuronal glial interactions. We propose that a gene therapy approach to administering CX3CL1 is viable and will be effective against rAAV9-synuclein models of PD. We will further examine interactions of chemokine signaling and T cells via IL12. CX3CL1 is a cytokine important in neuronal glial communication, however there is debate concerning which form of CX3CL1 is neuroprotective, as there are reports of neurodegenerative actions. We will continue exploring this question using 3 AAV9 constructs of CX3CL1 that have differential processing. In addition, ongoing neurodegeneration in ?-SYN models involves a complex interaction of chemokine signals that regulate both innate immune cells and T cells. We have preliminary data that one action of CX3CL1 is to reduce IL12, and important regulator of TH1 immunity.  Specific Aim 2: Hypothesis: Aging alters both the innate and adaptive immune system, thus will alter the efficacy of immune based therapies. As PD the majority of PD occurs in elderly subjects, it is critical to consider this with respect to therapeutic choices. We will examine if AAV9-CX3CL1 therapy is effective in the AAV9-?-SYN model PD in aged animals. WE know that microglia in aged rodents show predominantly M1 responses and have blunted M2 signaling. This may alter neuronal - glial-Tcell chemokine signaling. We will examine the effect of CX3CL1 treatment to alter microglial responses and interact with regulation of T cell populations.  Specific Aim 3: ?-Synuclein neurotoxicity is increased when T cells are present and depends on T cell- microglia communication via chemokines. We further predict that T cells in aged rats will have altered patterns of migration, homing and survival. Evidence is mounting that T cells play an important role in neurodegeneration in concert with microglia and other antigen presenting cells. This has not been studied extensively in models of PD involving ?-synuclein, however one study suggests a correlation. We will investigate this in the athymic nude rat, and then determine which type of T cell is involved by replacing T cell subsets individually by adoptive transfer methods."
"9254418","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          The diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of platelet-induced occlusive diseases of the coronary and cerebral circulation are a major challenge to the VA patient care mission. Excessive platelet activation and recruitment underlies the pathogenesis of platelet-induced occlusive vascular disease. Our proposal focuses on development of a novel approach toward prevention and treatment of these disorders, namely the use of the thromboregulatory ecto-apyrase ATPDase/CD39/NTPDase1. CD39 functions as the principal regulator of blood fluidity by metabolizing prothrombotic ATP and ADP released from activated platelets and other cells to prevent thrombus formation. We previously reported prothrombotic alterations in CD39 activity in patients with verified coronary artery disease. Subsequently, we examined leukocyte CD39 activity in stroke patients and found that lymphocytes from these subjects displayed changes in the ADPase/ATPase activity ratio, as compared to controls. This observation led to our hypothesis that alterations in CD39 activity can result in a predisposition for stroke. This application extends our previous research and focuses on three main areas. First, we will define the molecular biological mechanisms underlying regulation of expression and activity of CD39, and alterations therefrom that influence cellular function in vascular disease. Our preliminary data indicate that maximal CD39 enzyme activity requires formation of higher molecular weight complexes localized in cholesterol-rich membrane subdomains via a process requiring cleavage of the protein. We plan to fully confirm and extend these observations, including elucidation of the site of cleavage in CD39 and the subcellular location of the cleavage event. We have also determined that our recently discovered CD39 splice variants (V1-4) regulate apyrase activity at the cell surface. We will elucidate the role of these CD39 alternative splice variants in regulatio of CD39 intracellular trafficking and cleavage. We will also determine whether CD39 splice variant generation and translation is under tissue- and stimulus-specific regulation. CD39 splice variants modulate formation of enzymatically active CD39 species in the plasma membrane. This determines the pro- or antithrombotic phenotype of the cell. Second, we will further establish the relationship between alterations in CD39 activity, platelet reactivity, and stroke. W will extend our stroke research to 3 different patient groups: (1) Cryptogenic stroke patients (stroke in a young population without clinical etiology); (2) pre-stroke patients who have verified obstructive sleep apnea; and (3) classical atherothrombotic stroke patients. We have identified cryptogenic stroke and stroke-prone patients who have increased responsiveness to platelet agonists and increased expression of platelet and leukocyte activation markers. De-identified blood samples from these patients will be processed for isolation of platelets, lymphocytes and neutrophils. These will then be analyzed by several methods, including flow cytometry and our newly developed Broad Range Platelet Aggregometry System. In depth classification of these patients with regard to their threshold for platelet reactivity will increae our comprehension of the pathogenesis of stroke. This will also allow us to test our hypothesis that cryptogenic stroke may, in large part, represent a disorder of enhanced platelet reactivity. Third, we will determine CD39 surface expression and splice variant profiles in leukocytes of stroke patients versus controls by flow cytometry, quantitative real-time PCR, and DNA Fragment analyses. These studies will establish the relationship between stroke etiology and CD39 variant profile. This will further verify our hypothesis that altered CD39 activities play a role in cryptogenic stroke and provide a mechanistic basis for this role. Our proposed studies represent a multidisciplinary approach to the pathogenesis, prevention and treatment of ischemic stroke as well as to the regulatory aspects of our newly discovered CD39 splice variants. This research will enhance our knowledge of the mechanisms of action of CD39 and ultimately lead to development of a safe and effective treatment of platelet-driven occlusive vascular disorders in patients."
"9275440","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Scientific evidence indicates that schizophrenia is a genetically complex mental disorder. Researchers have characterized up to a million points on the genome to identify those regions related to the disorder. This approach has accounted for a small percentage of the occurrence of schizophrenia and sometimes the genetic predictors derived for schizophrenia also predict bipolar disorder. An alternative approach to clarify the genetic underpinnings of schizophrenia is to simplify the definition of the disorder so it more closely reflects the biological expression of genes that lead to the disorder. Gottesman proposed endophenotypes as useful tools in this regard. An endophenotype is a measurable characteristic unseen by the unaided eye that represents an aspect of the causal path between genes and disease. The potential value of endophenotypes for understanding the basis of schizophrenia has been widely acknowledged; however, their utility has not been fully actualized. Most investigations have failed to thoroughly examine potential endophenotypes in schizophrenia and to date promising indices have been distantly connected to known neural mechanisms of the brain. Thus, only weak links exist between current potential endophenotypes and testable pathophysiological substrates related to gene expression. This study will 1) test visual perceptual abnormalities in schizophrenia against endophenotype criteria, and 2) provide a quantitative model of visual perceptual abnormalities in schizophrenia that derives from experimental findings of neural mechanisms in visual cortex We hypothesize that genetic liability for schizophrenia is specifically associated with errant high- level contextual modulation of vision that can affect early perceptual functions, while schizophrenia itself is additionally associated with a disturbance in the use of low-level context to guide visual perception. Aim 1. Using data from a battery of psychophysical tasks we will a) clarify the nature of abnormal contextual modulation of low-level visual perception in schizophrenia, b) quantitatively model low-level contextual modulation abnormalities in the disorder, and c) test whether problems with low-level visual perception are specific to schizophrenia as compared to bipolar disorder. Aim 2. Using data from psychophysical tasks administered to probands and first-degree biological relatives we will a) determine whether abnormal contextual modulation of low-level visual perception marks genetic liability for schizophrenia, b) apply a quantitative model to test whether there are similar contextual modulation abnormalities in schizophrenia probands and their relatives, and c) determine whether errant contextual modulation of visual perception is specific to genetic liability for schizophrenia as compared to genetic liability for bipolar disorder. Aim3. Using cortical source signals derived from high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings that are constrained by both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data, we will a) determine the timing and frequency characteristics of neural responses related to abnormal contextual modulation of visual perception found in schizophrenia and in association with genetic liability for the disorder, and b) test whether deviant neural responses during visual perception in schizophrenia can be accounted for by a dysfunction in local divisive normalization."
"9275296","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background: Epithelial barrier integrity is critical for most gastrointestinal (GI) functions, including digestion of food, and absorption and secretion of nutrients. The gastrointestinal mucosal layer is very vulnerable to injury resulting in loss of barrier integrity, and this may all occur in critically ill veteran patients in response to surgical stress. Preventing it would likely have a major impact on outcomes and costs for all critically ill veteran populations, though the molecular controls that regulate barrier integrity are incompletely understood. This application will explore a promising approach to preserve, protect, and restore epithelial barrier function by manipulating the fundamental regulation of intestinal epithelial cells, while improving our overall understanding of their function and regulation. The bioactive sphingolipid sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a ubiquitous molecule produced intracellularly through a well characterized enzymatic cascade that can then regulate cell systems via cell surface receptors and known intracellular pathways. Manipulation of S1P has recently demonstrated significant effects on endothelial and epithelial cells in promoting important biological functions, such as survival of injured cells, and expression of barrier proteins. We have demonstrated in previously published work and our preliminary data that S1P has significant effects on intestinal epithelial cells and the intestinal barrier, both in physiologic and pathologic conditions. In this project we plan to build on our previous data supporting a potential therapeutic effect for S1P in accelerating the recovery of critically ill veterans in the intensive care unit. Objectives: We hypothesize that S1P protects the intestinal epithelial barrier in physiological and pathological surgical states as bot a 2nd messenger and extracellular ligand. To test this we will attempt to 1) Define the S1P signaling events related to intestinal epithelial barrier protein expression, 2) define the cellula mechanisms responsible for intestinal epithelial protection, 3) define the role of S1P in pathologic conditions both in vitro and in vivo. Methods: This proposal includes in vitro studies using cultured intestinal epithelial cells, ex vivo studies of tissues from mice and humans, and in vivo studies in mice. Findings: We have found intestinal epithelial cells, in response to S1P, show significant increases in barrier protein expression, proliferation and protection from apoptosis, and ultimately improved barrier function. S1P also has shown effects in stressful situations such as calcium free conditions or exposure to lipopolysaccharide. Status: Cells overexpressing Sphingosine Kinase 1, and expressing higher S1P content, show significantly increased proliferation, a process involving increased levels of c-Myc and a decrease in microRNA (mir) 542 among other findings. Mice exposed to S1P show improved barrier function in control states and during ischemia-reperfusion, and also decreased levels of mir 542. Impact: The proposed research addresses critical mechanisms in maintenance of an intact intestinal mucosal barrier, and in S1P, a potential therapy to preserve this function in critically ill patiens. Critical illness, particularly in surgical patients, is very common, and a high percentage of patients in the intensive care units incur stress-related injuries to their very vulnerable GI mucosa, leading to barrier dysfunction. Despite the medical advances of the past few decades, therapies for these gastro- intestinal injuries are, for the most part, conservative, as there is n current pharmacologic therapy available. This proposal explores such a pharmacologic therapy that could potentially prevent injury and loss of the intestinal epithelial cells and lead to improed outcomes of critically ill Veteran patients."
"9275407","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         In the past few years we have clearly demonstrated in two large diabetic cohorts of type 1 and type 2 diabetes (DCCT/EDIC and VADT cohorts) that high levels of immune complexes (IC) containing oxidized LDL (oxLDL) and advanced glycated end-products-modified LDL (AGE-LDL) are associated with coronary artery disease (CAD) 1-4 and can strongly predict the development and progression of CAD in the early stages of type 1 diabetes3. We have also shown in the VADT cohort, which includes many patients with advanced CAD, that high levels of malondialdehyde-modified (MDA)-LDL in IC are able to predict acute cardiovascular disease (CVD) events4. However, when circulating IC contain both high levels of MDA-LDL and high levels of oxLDL or AGE-LDL the risk to suffer an acute event is reduced4 leading us to conclude that the modified lipoproteins carried by IC play a differential modulating role in plaque progression/stability and plaque destabilization. Our mechanistic studies support the above hypothesis. OxLDL IC induces the transformation of macrophages into foam cells5-7, lead to upregulation of pro-survival genes8 and induces the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines10. OxLDL IC also induces increased collagen production by mesangial cells12. In contrast, MDA-LDL IC induces macrophage apoptosis, stimulate the expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) by macrophages and by aortic endothelial cells, and reduce the expression of collagen genes in mesangial cells. Hypothesis and Specific Aims: Based on our clinical and in vitro preliminary data, we hypothesize that the type of predominant modifications of LDL in circulating IC (MDA-LDL, oxLDL or AGE-LDL) has a significant impact in plaque progression/destabilization. We postulate that, when MDA is the predominant modification of the LDL carried by IC, the uptake of those IC by macrophages induces cell apoptosis, increased release of MMPs, and increased collagenase activity, thus contributing to plaque destabilization. In contrast, when oxLDL is the predominant modification of LDL in IC, the uptake of these IC induce macrophage survival and stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory mediators and growth factors, thus contributing to plaque expansion/stability. Furthermore we postulate that a biomarker panel including MDA-LDL IC and MMPs will be more able to strongly predict patients at high risk to suffer acute CVD events than a panel of conventional CVD biomarkers. To test the above hypotheses we propose three aims. The first aim will compare the activation patterns of macrophages exposed to IC (MDA-LD IC and oxLDL IC), the effect of these IC on the survival and apoptosis of macrophages, and the pathways involved. In the second aim we will measure novel biomarkers known to be associated with plaque instability in patient samples from the VADT cohort in which MDA-LDL IC and conventional CVD biomarkers have been previously measured. We will determine whether a panel including MDA-LDL IC, MMP-1 and MMP-9 will have a significantly higher predictive power to identify patients at high risk for acute MI. Finally in the third aim we will determine, on an animal mouse model of atherosclerosis and type 2 diabetes whether blocking/reducing engagement of Fc?Rs by oxLDL IC and MDA-LDL IC by treatment with mouse IgM anti-oxLDL and IgM anti-MDA-LDL will prevent plaque progression and instability. Methods: Cell isolation and culture, separation and modification of lipoproteins, isolation of antibodies, protein arrays, cell viability/apoptosis assays, rtPCR, western blots, enzyme-activity assays, immunohistochemical analysis of gene expression and histologic analysis of atherosclerotic lesions. Relevance to VA Health and Significance: The definition of mechanisms responsible for the differences in cell activation, survival and apoptosis induced by different modified LDL-IC may allow to define new therapeutic targets and new prevention strategies that will curtail the progression of cardiovascular complications and the occurrence of acute vascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes."
"9275316","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The proposed experiments of this Merit Review competitive renewal are part of the effort by many labs to determine how central nervous system neurons encode their synaptic inputs. In particular, the experiments are designed to determine how specific neurons (or abnormal function of those neurons) contribute to synchronous network activity that occurs both during normal signal processing and during seizure activity. The major questions are 'What temporal aspects of natural patterns of synaptic activity are most effective for driving a neuron's action potential firing?' and 'What are the underlying mechanisms?' We focus on the responses of principal cells in neocortex (pyramidal neurons) to local circuit activity. The convergent synaptic activity generated by cortical networks has a broad frequency spectrum, similar to random noise. We have shown that the pyramidal neurons show resonant firing to this type of input. That is, specific frequency components of their input drive firing better than others. Two input frequencies cause the resonance: theta (~7 Hz) and fast ripple (~300 Hz). Additional studies point to certain potassium conductance mechanisms as being critical for the type and amount of resonance a pyramidal neuron has. A mutation in the gene (KCN1) for one of these potassium channels (Kv1) and antibodies against the Kv1.1 protein are known to cause spontaneous and excessive discharges of central neurons in humans, leading to problems with motor function. Our current proposal includes three sets of experiments. In the first we will determine the role of Kv1 channels in dendritic filtering of excitatory inputs. In the second set we will determine the effect of Kv1 channels on the suprathreshold responses to dendritic inputs (e.g. resonant firing). In the third set we will examine the changes in neuronal excitability caused by normal and pathologic up-regulation of dendritic Kv1.1 channel subunits. The methods employ patch pipettes to record from visualized neurons in brain slices. Neurons are stimulated by 2-photon photolysis of caged glutamate near spines on dendrites. Neurons are also stimulated in current clamp and dynamic clamp using computer-generated waveforms that simulate the statistics of ongoing synaptic activity arriving at the soma (focusing mostly on excitatory inputs). To investigate how potassium channels affect the responses, potassium channel blockers are applied to the neurons during the electrical recording. Anatomical classification of neurons is done by intracellular staining with a fluorescent dye."
"9268550","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is the second most common dementia syndrome in the elderly, and the most common for people under 65 years. There are currently no treatments. Loss-of-function mutations in the progranulin (PGRN, GRN) gene are an important cause of familial frontotemporal lobar degeneration with TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43)-positive inclusions (FTLD-TDP). The underlying mechanisms are largely unknown. PGRN in the brain is expressed in neurons and microglia. PGRN-deficient mouse models exhibit FTD-related behavioral deficits. One of the major pathologies is altered innate immune responses, in the forms of exacerbated microglial activation and elevated inflammatory responses associated with NF-kappaB hyperactivation. Our recent published study showed that selective reduction of microglial PGRN markedly enhances amyloid beta (Abeta) deposition, mostly likely via impairing phagocytosis, and exacerbates Abeta toxicity in Alzheimer's disease (AD) mouse models. In preliminary studies, we showed that selective deletion of PGRN in adult microglia recapitulates the FTD-like behavior alterations observed in Grn-/- mice. These studies strongly support the importance of microglial PGRN in balancing innate immune response and maintaining cognition in aging brain. Besides altered innate immune response, mice lacking PGRN also exhibit an early onset of lipofuscinosis reminiscent of that in lysosomal storage diseases. Based on these findings, we hypothesize that PGRN deficiency-induced endolysosmal dysfunction underlies aberrant microglial activation, leading to FTD- related dysfunction in circuits and cognition. Three Aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. Aim 1 is designed to determine decisively if GRN haploinsufficiency leads to endolysosomal dysfunction in human iPSC-derived neurons with GRN mutations and isogenic controls. Unbiased proteomic and pathway analyses will also be performed to probe the underlying mechanisms. In Aim 2, we will test the hypothesis that PGRN deficiency-induced endolysosmal dysfunction underlies hyperactive NF-kappaB signaling, leading to microglial dysfunction. Specifically, we will determine if PGRN deficiency impairs endocytic turnover of innate response receptors and intracellular NF-kappaB signaling molecules. We will also determine if inactivating IkappaB kinase beta in PGRN deficient microglia restores microglial function. In Aim 3, we will address how PGRN-deficient microglia lead to FTD-like cognitive deficits. Based on our preliminary studies, we will focus on medium spinal neurons (MSNs) in striatum, which exhibited elevated excitability in Grn-/- mice. Hyperactivity of MSNs has been associated with compulsive behaviors often observed in FTD patients. We will determine if PGRN-deficient microglia are sufficient to induce alterations in striatal circuits, and if selectiv inactivation of NF-kappaB rescues cognitive and circuit deficits induced by PGRN-deficient microglia. Completion of the aims will yield fundamental insights into the role of innate immunity in FTD-related behavioral disturbance and circuit dysfunction, which could lay the foundation for development of disease-modifying therapies for FTD patients."

Based on preliminary data in a murine model of anti-RNP autoimmunity and human studies, we hypothesize that a subset of CD11c+ CD11bhigh CD103- myeloid dendritic cells acting through TLR-inducible TRIF-mediated pathways play a central role in the pathogenesis of anti-RNP autoimmune lung disease. In this proposal, we will test this hypothesis with studies in animal models. In Aim 1, we will assess the relevance of TRIF to anti-RNP lung disease by direct immunization and adoptive transfer studies with TRIF-/- mice. In Aim 2, we will assess the relevance of CD11b+ mDC's to anti-RNP lung disease using depletion studies with clodronate or antibodies to DC surface markers, and we will test the therapeutic efficacy of a novel immunosuppressive therapeutic agent that targets CD11b-expressing cells in anti-RNP lung disease. These studies will lead to improved understanding and potentially to novel treatment approaches for a spectrum of autoimmune disease for which current treatments have not been efficacious."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the University of Pittsburgh Global Health Research and Research Training eCapacity Initiative is to enhance evidence-based, data-driven decision-making in India through innovations in information and communication technology using modeling and simulation to assess the health and economic impacts of alternative disease control strategies. To globalize the advantages of methods and curricula developed in the Public Health Dynamics Laboratory (PHDL) at the University of Pittsburgh, we believe it is essential to have local public health experts take the lead in developing, running and analyzing the models. Our objective is to enhance the capacity of researchers to use computational modeling, not only at our Fogarty training site, SHARE INIDA (D43 TW009078), but also at multiple Fogarty training sites in India. In the introductory Phase 1, a two-day symposium (35 participants), SHARE INDIA, Hyderabad, will introduce the concept of the integrated decision support pathway, and basic modeling software and tools. This symposium will showcase research that enables data-driven decision making using cutting-edge methods including mathematical, network, and agent-based modeling. Five Indian investigators plus one modeling support staff will receive in-depth, hands- on training in computational modeling during a week-long workshop at the University of Pittsburgh PHDL. This workshop on complex agent-based modeling will use our open-source modeling platform, FRED (Framework for Reconstructing Epidemic Dynamics). This experience will foster establishment of a new collaborative network for modeling studies among Indian researchers and with PHDL researchers. Two small modeling developmental grants will be awarded. Phase 2 will focus on sustainability. Two small research grants will help sustain newly developed, collaborative modeling projects. Two PHDL modelers will return to India to visit the recipients of the small grants and solidify collaboratios. Two week-long short courses on computational modeling in public health, incorporating educational materials and free software from the Pittsburgh Workshop, will be presented by Indian faculty at CR Rao Institute targeting 25 participants each. A second introductory symposium for 35 new participants, led by newly trained Indian modelers, will stimulate a new wave of interest in modeling. Our aims address an unmet need in Indiai.e. building capacity of researchers to use cutting-edge, yet appropriate technology to address policy-relevant questions. The education program will result in increased knowledge among Fogarty-affiliated researchers in India of the kinds of data needed to inform models and basic methods in modeling. Trainees who attend the workshops in Pittsburgh and sustain their use of modeling through small research grants are expected to continue to apply computational modeling methods to address Public Health questions of importance to India. These trainees are also expected to lead computational modeling collaborations within India and with PHDL faculty. In the future, the program is expected to result in funded research that aids data-driven decision-making in Public Health in India."
"9249451","DESCRIPTION: Major osteoporotic fractures are common, morbid, and costly among long-stay nursing home residents. Despite the importance of this problem, there are no guidelines to screen nursing home residents for osteoporosis, and it is unclear which osteoporosis medications prevent fractures in long-stay residents. To address these gaps of knowledge we propose the following specific aims: 1) develop and validate a prediction tool using clinical risk factors for falls and fracture that will estimate the 2 year absolute risk of hip fracture and the  year absolute risk of major osteoporotic fracture (hip, humerus, and wrist combined) in long-stay nursing home residents; 2) determine whether osteoporosis medications (i.e., bisphosphonates, calcitonin, estrogen, raloxifene, and teriparatide) reduce the incidence of hip and major osteoporotic fracture in long-stay nursing home residents; and 3) determine the clinical thresholds of risk at which osteoporosis medications reduce the incidence of hip and major osteoporotic fracture by e 20% in long-stay residents. This project will leverage an existing database that has previously linked claims data from Medicare Parts A and B with pharmacy data (Medicare Part D), clinical characteristics (Minimum Data Set), and facility level characteristics (OSCAR). Using this database we will conduct a prospective analysis on all U.S. nursing home residents enrolled in a Medicare fee-for-service plan and with e 90 day length of stay between the years 2006-2011 (>700,000 residents annually). For specific aim 1, the prediction tools will be developed entirely from clinical information that is available for all U.S long-stay residents, such as cognitive and functional status, non-osteoporosis medication use, and recent history of falls. The prediction tools will account for the high mortality in nursing home residents. For specific aim 2a, we will determine whether osteoporosis medications reduce the incidence of hip and major osteoporotic fracture in long-stay residents by comparing the incidence of fracture among new users of an osteoporosis medication with the incidence of fracture in non-users, matched by propensity scores. For specific aim 2b, we will determine a threshold for pharmacologic intervention by examining the efficacy of osteoporosis drugs according to baseline fracture risk, as estimated by the fracture prediction tool. The research team has experience in pharmacoepidemiology, geriatrics, and analysis of Medicare claims data and Minimum Data Set characteristics necessary to complete this project. Our findings will be highly significant as they will provide the first guidance on screening and treatment of osteoporosis in the nursing home setting. We anticipate that our findings will be easy for providers to implement because the fracture prediction tools will be comprised of clinical information that is already available for all U.S. nursing home residents. Knowledge gained from this study could ultimately result in a decreased rate of major osteoporotic fractures in the nursing home setting, with a subsequent reduction in morbidity and health care costs."

"9277602","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although significant resources have been invested in HIV programs, Uganda is still far from the universal access-to-care target of 80%. While Uganda has developed highly successful research collaborations in HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria over the last 30 years, most of this work has been focused on clinical research, and the findings have not always translated into policy and practice changes. At present, we need an urgent and comparable investment in implementation science (ImS) research to strengthen the response to the HIV epidemic. Effective service delivery by HIV/AIDS programs and engagement in care among HIV-infected individuals will allow antiretroviral medications to reach their optimal public health impact. Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MakCHS) has collaborated with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) for over three decades on a range of scientific studies. We plan to leverage this foundation and build a multi-disciplinary team to create a world-class training program for ImS focused on delivery of HIV/AIDS services and engagement in care. Building on the findings of our planning grant, we propose a unique multi-disciplinary ImS research training program at Makerere University School of Medicine. The goals of the proposed program are to: 1) provide training and mentoring in the field of implementation science to Ugandan scholars 2) establish an ImS training site at Makerere University School of Medicine for Uganda and other institutions in Africa. The specific objectives of this training program are to: 1) strengthen the scientific leadership and expertise needed for implementation science research; 2) strengthen the sustainability of implementation science research at Makerere University by integrating ImS research into on-going capacity building programs; 3) promote collaborations between academic research institutions and faculty in Uganda and those in the US; 4) Strengthen trainee contributions to evidence-based decision making related to HIV prevention, care and treatment services through regular interactions with policy makers and HIV program implementers; 5) optimize training through utilization of additional available resources in Uganda (including projects funded by the NIH, PEPFAR and other international agencies); 6) strengthen research capacity in Uganda by helping trainees to integrate into Ugandan institutions and pursue independently-supported scientific careers; 7) create a Centre of Excellence for ImS at MakCHS to serve as a training site for other institutions in Africa. The proposed ImS training program will build on existing relationships between scientists at MakCHS and its affiliated HIV programs (medical), the Makerere University College of Humanities and Social Sciences (non-medical), UCSF and UCB. During our five year program, we anticipate training Ugandan trainees as follows: 2 candidates in master's degree programs at UCSF, 8 candidates in master's degree programs at Makerere University, 4 candidates in long-term non-degree training (including post-doc training), 20 candidates in a modular certificate program and over 700 candidates in short-term non-degree programs."
"9374459","G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-mediated signal transduction is central to human physiology and disease intervention, yet the molecular mechanisms responsible for ligand-specific signaling responses remain poorly understood. The discovery of functional selectivity, or biased agonism, has fundamentally impacted our understanding of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Biased agonists preferentially activate particular G protein-dependent or non-canonical G protein-independent pathways, including those mediated by arrestin recruitment to the receptor. In addition to their roles in GPCR desensitization and trafficking, arrestins also scaffold signaling pathways distinct from those involving G protein. Arrestin-biased ligands have been identified for a number of different receptors, including dopamine D2, angiotensin, and beta-2 (?2) adrenergic receptors. Carvedilol, for instance, is an arrestin-biased agonist for the ?1 and ?2 adrenergic receptors (?2AR) that exhibits beneficial cardioprotective effects. Arrestin-specific signaling is likely triggered by agonist-induced conformational changes within the receptor and the formation of agonist-dependent conformations of the GPCR-arrestin complex. Recent findings further suggest that arrestin may retain ?active-like? conformations even after dissociating from the receptor. Although arrestin-specific agonism plays a critical role in GPCR- mediated signaling, we lack a molecular and kinetic understanding of how GPCR-arrestin complexes form and the physical basis of biased agonism. Such information is paramount to the rational design of drugs with desired efficacies at specific effectors. Ensemble spectroscopic methods can potentially provide critical insights into GPCR-mediated signaling, but bulk methods of this kind rely on the interpretation of average responses from very large numbers of potentially heterogeneous receptor-effector complexes, masking critical information about the conformational changes underpinning function. We have therefore sought to establish the means to directly quantify the dynamics of individual GPCRs proteins at the single-molecule scale using wide-field, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) single-molecule fluorescence and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging methods. Single-molecule imaging offers the potential to bypass the limitations of ensemble measurements by enabling direct observations of stochastic, asynchronous conformational processes associated with function. Using this approach, we have quantified ligand efficacy for G protein coupling to the beta2-adrenergic receptor (?2AR). In the proposed initiatives we will delineate the agonist- dependent conformational changes associated with receptor and arrestin complex formation using the ?2AR as our model system. These efforts will reveal, for the first time, the order and timing of the key conformational transitions in both receptor and arrestin required for, and associated with, receptor-arrestin interaction, information vital to advancing our understanding of the arrestin activation mechanism and the nature of biased agonism with important ramifications for the development of more selective therapeutics."
"9257209","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     There is strong evidence that disability among older adults is largely driven by illnesses and injuries that lead to hospitalizations. Data shows the likelihood of developing new or worsening disability, as well as a reduced likelihood of recovery from disability, is greatly increased with hospitalization. Our work has shown low mobility to be associated with adverse outcomes including decline in activities of daily living (ADLs), nursing home placement and death, even after controlling for illness severity and comorbidity. Intervention studies examining the effect o increasing mobility during hospitalization are sparse and typically measure in-hospital outcomes such as length of stay. However in our VA-funded study, we showed patients who received an in-hospital mobility intervention that included twice daily assistance with walking and a behavioral strategy that addressed barriers to mobility, setting of mobility goals, and encouraged patients to walk, had a clinically significant higher level of community mobility at one month post-discharge compared to usual care. This preliminary work was restricted to only one month of follow-up of veterans who were ? 65 years of age. A number of important gaps remain in our understanding of the impact of a hospital mobility program: 1) hospital mobility program studies have not used a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design to evaluate the impact; 2) the actual number of steps and time spent walking by participants has not been measured; 3) outcomes beyond 30 days post-discharge have not been examined; and 4) characteristics of patients most likely to benefit from this type of intervention has not been identified. For this high impact stud we propose to use a stepped wedge cluster randomization design on five VA hospital wards to compare a mobility program (MP) to usual care (UC) among a cohort of veterans age ? 50 years. We will examine mobility and adverse outcomes including functional decline, nursing home admission, emergency department (ED) visits, hospitalization and death in the MP and UC groups in the year after hospital discharge using in-hospital and post-hospital assessments. Our overarching hypothesis is that a hospital mobility program that provides assistance with ambulation during hospitalization will reduce the observed loss of mobility and adverse outcomes associated with hospitalization and this difference between MP and UC will be maintained throughout the year follow-up period. The major aims of this research project are to test the effectiveness of a mobility program on recovery to pre-hospital mobility status or better and reduction of adverse outcomes including functional decline, ED visits, hospitalization, nursing home admission and death in the year after hospitalization; and to identify characteristics that modify the effect of the mobility intervention on recovery to pre-hospital mobility status or better and reduction of adverse outcomes in the year after hospitalization. A successful mobility intervention that prevents loss of mobility or quickens recovery to pre-hospital levels could significantly impact quality of life and reduce disability for thousands of hospitalized patients. This line of research has the potential to change the standard of hospital care provided to all patients."

"9331903","13th International Conference on Myasthenia Gravis and Related Disorders PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT The treatment for myasthenia gravis (MG) ? a rare, acquired autoimmune syndrome resulting in severe muscle weakness, significant disability, and decreased life expectancy ? has improved dramatically in the last several decades. However, many knowledge gaps still remain to improving MG patient outcomes including the understanding the origin of MG, identifying the factors that contribute to chronic disease, and finding a way to cure the disease. To address these unmet needs, the New York Academy of Sciences and the Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America will convene the 3-day 13th International Conference on Myasthenia Gravis and Related Disorders on May 15 ? 17, 2017, in New York City, NY. This conference will convene approximately 300 attendees ? including basic scientists and clinical investigators in academia, industry, and government; physicians; pharmaceutical strategists; and patient advocates ? in an effort to address these aforementioned knowledge gaps. Conference sessions will combine basic, translational, and clinical researchers and will feature a unique format of short, focused talks centered on critical open research questions, with the 13 plenary sessions focusing on: structure and function of the neuromuscular junction, congenital syndromes, serological phenotypes, mechanisms of autoimmunity, recent clinical developments, animal models of neuromuscular disease, MG treatment updates, and global MG treatment guidelines. The five central aims of this program are to: (i) provide a forum for basic, translational, and clinical researchers from academia and industry to present and discuss the most up-to-date findings in MG research; (ii) explore and encourage multidisciplinary and multi-sector collaborations to enhance investigative approaches into MG and related autoimmune and neuromuscular disorders; (iii) review current MG therapeutic options, ongoing clinical trials, and challenges and limitations faced in the clinic; (iv) identify knowledge gaps and future directions of research required for further breakthroughs; and (v) showcase and encourage the participation of early career, female, and underrepresented minority investigators via short talks, poster presentations, travel fellowships, career mentoring activities, and discounted registration. The conference goals align well with the mission of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS) to support the advancement of new knowledge on neurological disorders. In addition, the NINDS? specific goal of disseminating information about scientific discoveries and their implications for neurological health will be met via a live simulcast broadcast of the meeting and the publication of a post-conference, enduring, open-access, Section 508-compliant Meeting Report in Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, which will distribute the scientific knowledge and ideas exchanged at the meeting to the global research and medical communities. Only through cross-field collaborative research envisioned as a result of this conference can we fully guide research forward in the field, particularly with respect to potential innovative therapeutic approaches."
"9301988","Improved long-term biocompatibility of coronary stents by plasma coating process Abstract Drug-eluting stents (DES) have been widely used to treat patients of coronary heart disease (CHD) due to their better ability to control restenosis than bare metal stents (BMS). However, there is a high risk of late in-stent thrombosis associated with DES after implantation in patients, which could lead to fatal heart attack and death even though it occurs at low rate. Thus, for safe and effective clinical use, a coronary stent needs to have better long-term biocompatibility on its surface that will provide sufficient thrombo-resistance in addition to inhibiting smooth muscle cell proliferation thereby slowing down healing of tissues around the stent. Nanova, Inc. is developing a novel coating layer of high thrombo-resistance on the surface of stents made of stainless steel or CrCo. An environmentally benign technology, low temperature plasma process is used to deposit an ultra-thin (nano-scale) but continuous layer of coating, sufficient to generate desired abrasion resistance and immobilize the bioactive functional groups created in the subsequent surface treatment to prevent blood clotting and restenosis, but thin enough to allow for stent expansion without cracking when delivered into the atherosclerotic coronary arteries of patients. The knowledge gained in this innovative research project will also benefit research and development for improved biocompatibility for other implantable medical devices such as pacemakers, pulse generators, cardiac defibrillators and bio-sensors."
"9123378","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although many military families appear to cope effectively with stressors associated with wartime military service, mounting empirical evidence has suggested that a sizeable subset of military-connected children are experiencing adverse outcomes, including increased rates of physical and mental health problems, substance use, and suicidality. These outcomes are a public health concern because of their long-term consequences for healthy, positive development. They suggest the need to explore the cumulative impact of stressors and protective factors that may contribute to resilient processes in military families and lead to better outcomes for military youth. This project, a secondary analysis of Army Comprehensive Soldier and Family Fitness (CSF2) data and linked Department of Defense administrative datasets, will use person-focused statistical models, including latent class analysis, to examine naturally occurring patterns of risk and protective factors in military families. Profiles of risk and protective factors will be associated with role performance and health and mental health outcomes for military spouses, who are critical to the well-being of youth in military families. The cascading effects of spouse outcomes on youth will be incorporated into risk and protective factor profiles associated with role performance and health and mental health outcomes for youth. Data on risk factors, including deployments, family relocations, and financial strain, will be drawn from administrative datasets including the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System and Defense Manpower Data Center. CSF2 data will inform protective factors, including access to social support and positive coping skills.  Health and mental health outcomes, available through the Defense Health Agency for all service members and their dependents, will include health care appointments and ICD-9 codes for any diagnoses received. Datasets will be linked through the use of the Person-Event Data Environment, an online portal for analyzing the Army's vast administrative data holdings. Planned analyses will elucidate the collective impact of multiple, concurrent stressors on outcomes for military-connected dependents and may highlight possible points of intervention to improve outcomes for this population. Developing new knowledge in this area addresses program priorities of the Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Branch of the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, including exploring consequences for child health of exposure to war, violence, and other man-made disasters. Further, the proposed project will provide the applicant with research and training opportunities to develop skills needed to become an independent researcher in a large, research- focused university setting at the next stage of her career."
"9206071","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           In the United States and throughout the world, cancer incidence and mortality has increased dramatically in both developed and developing nations. Cancer causes ~13% of human deaths with 7.6 million people dying from cancer in 2007. More people in the US die of lung cancer than breast, colon, kidney, and prostate cancers combined. Recent studies show that veterans are 25 to 75 percent more likely to develop lung cancer than people who did not serve in the military; yet therapies for lung cancer and other solid tumors are still limited.  Recent successes  in T cell cancer immunotherapy point to a potential breakthrough in treatment. T cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors or tumor-reactive ?? TCRs have cured patients with advanced metastatic disease. Intrinsic T cell immunity against tumors can be released using mAbs to remove inhibition by checkpoint CTLA-4 and PD-1 receptors which has resulted in a number of cures in melanoma and lung cancer. Yet, significant limitations exist for these therapies. Therapy is limited to certain cancers, not all patients respond to therapy, and there is  significant toxicity. Although showing great promise, additional approaches to cancer immunotherapy are needed.  Treatment with ?? T cells expressing V?2V?2 TCRs is one such therapy that shows promise. In contrast to ?? T cells, the antigen responses of ?? T cells expressing V?2V?2 TCRs are not MHC restricted. The major subset of human ?? T cells use their V?2V?2 T cell receptors to recognize the foreign-microbial isoprenoid metabolite, HMBPP, and the self-metabolite, IPP. Normal cells and tumor cells from a wide variety of tissues can stimulate V?2V?2 cells. V?2V?2 T cells expand to very high numbers during many infections (up to 1 in 2 circulating T cells) and can kill tumor cells and infected cells as well as secrete inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors. Two approaches are being used to treat cancer with V?2V?2 T cells. The first is to immunize with stimulators such as the bromohydrin analog of HMBPP or the aminobisphosphonate, zoledronate, with low-dose IL-2. The second is to adoptively transfer V?2V?2 T cells grown ex vivo. This approach has cured a patient with metastatic kidney cancer, induced remission in another with breast cancer, and induced partial remissions or stable disease in other patients but needs to be made more effective.     Metabolic engineering of bacteria is a new field of study that has focused on altering bacteria for  drug or chemical synthesis. Changes in bacterial metabolism are made by modifying biochemical pathways or by introducing new ones. We have now provided proof-of-principle for this approach by metabolic engineering Salmonella to overproduce HMBPP and demonstrating responses in monkeys. We now propose to improve our Salmonella vaccine and to test a new Listeria vaccine. Both species have been used for cancer vaccines but differ significantly because Salmonella is given orally whereas Listeria is given intravenously. We will use the bacterial vaccines to target and activate adoptively transferred V?2V? 2 T cell in tumors because they preferentially localize to tumor cells.  To accomplish our goals, we will: metabolically engineer bacteria to overproduce HMBPP, test engineered bacteria in vitro and in vivo in monkeys, and assess the ability of metabolically engineered bacteria to target and activate adoptively transferred V?2V?2 T cells to control tumors. We have an outstanding team with an excellent track record and have extensive experience working with ?? T cells and isoprenoid metabolism. We have established in vivo models and techniques. A proof-of-principle Salmonella vaccine has been derived and the results recently published. The molecular methods to create more vaccines are well developed. In conclusion, immunotherapy using metabolically engineered bacterial vaccines with V?2V?2 T cells has the potential to be broadly applicable for the treatment of many different tumors both by direct activation and through adoptive transfer."
"9339494","Project Summary/Abstract Obesity exacerbates age-related declines in physical function and is a strong determinant of mobility disability. Given that one-third of older adults are obese, identifying effective therapies that prevent obesity-related declines in physical function are urgently needed. The loss of lean mass with age contributes to age-related declines in physical function and current weight loss recommendations may further exacerbate this loss of lean mass. Although weight loss improves physical function while in the weight-reduced state, most individuals are not successful at long-term maintenance of weight loss. Furthermore, data from middle aged and older adults suggest that weight regain following weight loss is comprised of greater fat relative to lean mass. Consequently, weight loss and subsequent weight regain may lead to even less relative lean mass and worse physical function. The amount of protein consumed during weight loss may be a key determinant in preserving lean mass during weight loss and higher protein intake following weight loss may enhance weight loss maintenance by reducing overall weight regain, in part, by favoring regain of lean mass over fat. However, whether the potential benefit of lean mass retention and accretion with a higher protein diet during and subsequent to weight loss translates into greater improvements in physical function in obese older adults is unknown. Our primary goal is to determine whether a higher protein (1.2 g/kg body wt/d) / lower carbohydrate (CHO) diet during a 6-month weight loss intervention in obese older adults improves physical function compared with an isocaloric lower protein (current RDA of 0.8 g/kg body wt/d) / higher CHO diet and whether continuing a higher protein / lower CHO diet during the 12-month follow-up results in better maintenance of improved physical function. We propose to conduct an 18-month randomized trial in 225 obese (BMI 30-40 kg/m2), older (65-79 yrs) men and women at risk for disability (SPPB ?10) to determine the effects of a higher protein / lower CHO diet during a 6-month weight loss intervention followed by 12 months of follow-up on 1) physical function (assessed by the expanded Short Physical Performance Battery (expSPPB), muscle strength and power), and 2) weight maintenance and body composition (assessed by DXA and CT). We will also assess the effects of a higher protein / lower CHO diet on changes in bone mineral density and cardiometabolic risk factors. All participants will undergo a 6-month weight loss intervention followed by 12 months of follow-up with randomization to one of 3 groups: 1) lower protein / higher CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss and 12-month follow-up phases; 2) higher protein / lower CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss phase only; or 3) higher protein / lower CHO diet for the 6-month weight loss and 12-months follow-up phases. Determining whether a higher protein diet during and subsequent to weight loss maximizes potential benefits on physical function while minimizing potential adverse effects of weight loss (e.g., loss of lean and bone mass) may lead to more effective weight loss interventions for obese older adults."
"9263005","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common devastating neurodegenerative disorder affecting up to 25% of individuals over 65 years of age. Data from patients and animal models of PD have shown that the development of parkinsonisms is associated with the emergence of abnormally strong and widely synchronized oscillatory activity (OS) of the basal ganglia that developed after degeneration of midbrain dopamine containing neurons. Based on recent studies, we hypothesize that abnormal OS in the dopamine-depleted basal ganglia of PD patients is critically dependent on the development of abnormal OS in a nucleus called the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), which has strong neuronal connections with most of other nuclei in the basal ganglia. The main goal of this project is to reveal alterations of the functional and anatomical connectivity of GPe that underlie the generation of abnormal OS. Specifically, the aims of this grant are to reveal how dopamine depletion alters 1) the firing behavior of GPe neurons, 2) the conductivity of abnormal OS in the cortico-striato- GPe pathway, and 3) the properties of subthalamo-GPe loop that amplifies abnormal OS, all of which will provide information for designing experimental therapeutic strategies to reduce behavioral deficits in PD subjects. The results of the proposed studies will advance our understanding of the functional organization of the basal ganglia in pathological conditions and provide clear directions for future investigations including the formulation of treatment strategies of human parkinsonisms."
"9466165","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The primary rationale for the Duke Aging Center Postdoctoral Research Training Program (RTP) proposed here is to continue to train highly skilled research scientists who have strong backgrounds in substantive areas related to aging and who also have the potential for leadership in gerontological research. Each fellow is assigned a mentor or mentors and works within that person's research program; we also have an interdisciplinary seminar which all fellows must attend. Fellows typically spend two years in the RTP. Our approach is to consider aging research from a biopsychosocial perspective. Consistent with this theme, the RTP faculty and their facilities enable outstanding research training in the following areas related to aging: Biomedical Sciences; Social Sciences, Health services Research and Biostatistics; and Behavioral and Neurosciences. Fellows spend a significant portion of their time on research. They are integrated into their mentors' research programs and mentored through collaborative and independent research projects. All fellows and some faculty attend our weekly RTP seminar on research in aging. This seminar follows a structured curriculum on the biopsychosocial aspects of aging and the interdisciplinary nature of aging research, as well as professional development, research design and analysis, and research ethics. Potential fellows' applications include a detailed NIH-format research application (with input from their mentors), a curriculum vita, graduate transcripts, career and training plans, and letters of recommendation. Ultimately, most fellows either join university faculties or research organizations after completing the RTP. We request support for 6 postdoctoral fellows. The Duke Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development is the primary research training facility for fellows supported by this grant. Associated faculty are located throughout the University and Medical Center."
"9206068","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Patients with critical surgical disorders such as trauma, thermal injury, shock, sepsis, and massive surgical operations are commonly complicated with acute gut mucosal injury and bleeding, but effective therapies to preserve the epithelial integrity are limited to date. Disrupton of the gut epithelial integrity causes sepsis and in some instances acts as the trigger that drives  multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), a leading cause of death in critically ill patients. Early rapid epithelial restitution is an important primary repair modality in the gut mucosa and plays a critical role in maintaining mucosal integrity, but the exact mechanism underlying this process remains unclear. Epithelial restitution occurs as a consequence of cell migration over the damaged area after superficial injury, a process that is independent of cell proliferation. Our  previous studies have demonstrated that small GTPases are crucial for normal gut mucosal restitution after acute injury. However, the exact signals initiating the activation of GTPases aftr injury remain elusive and are the focus of this renewal application. a4 is a novel PP2A associated protein and is involved in many aspects of cell functions including cell motility. Our preliminary results indicate that a) early rapid mucosal restitution following injury was associate with an induction in a4 expression in mice; b) ectopic overexpression of the a4 gene enhanced epithelial restitution after wounding, whereas a4 silencing or inhibition of its downstream target ß-PIX repressed mucosal repair through a process involving the GTPase Rac1; and c) polyamines are necessary for normal expression of a4. Based on these exciting preliminary observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that a4 stimulates intestinal epithelial restitution after acute mucosal injury by altering PP2A/ß-PIX-mediated Rac1 signaling. Three specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis: 1) to determine the pattern and role of a4 in gut epithelial restitution after acute mucosal injury in critical surgical conditions; 2) to analyze the mechanism  by which a4 regulates IEC migration during epithelial restitution; and 3) to define the cellular signaling pathways regulating a4 expression after mucosal injury, with a particular focus on cellular polyamines. Completion of this study will create a fundamental base for development of new therapies to enhance early rapid mucosal repair and preserve gut epithelial integrity under critical surgical conditions."
"9277668","Project Summary For decades, Pavlovian fear conditioning has been the dominant paradigm to study the amygdala. However, this paradigm is poorly suited to examine the relation between amygdala activity and behavior. Indeed, conditioning changes the likelihood that conditioned stimuli (CS) will elicit conditioned responses (CRs) making it difficult to disentangle whether training-induced alterations in activity are related to the valence or identity of CSs, to the behaviors they elicit, or a mixture thereof. To circumvent these limitations, we will examine how amygdala activity controls different conditioned behaviors using a novel task, the Risk- Reward Interaction (RRI) task, which allows one to compare, in the same rats and neurons, activity related to different conditioned behaviors triggered by the same CS. The RRI task takes advantage of the rats' natural ability to associate places with behaviors. Rats are trained to respond to the same light CS in different ways depending on where the CS is presented. They learn that in some positions, the CS signals reward availability and in others, an impending footshock. The footshock can be avoided passively or actively, depending on the rats' position with respect to the CS. Therefore, in Aim 1, we will determine whether amygdala cells encode the location or valence of the CS, or the CRs they elicit, by simultaneously recording neurons in different nuclei of the basolateral amygdaloid complex (BLA= lateral, LA + basolateral, BL + basomedial, BM) while rats perform the RRI task. We will compare the dependence of firing rates on CS location and type of conditioned behaviors on correct vs. error trials, allowing us to determine whether the same, different, or overlapping subsets of cells fire in relation to reward-seeking, freezing, active avoidance, and passive avoidance. Then, in Aim 2, we will examine whether valence and behavior coding varies as a function of the neurons' projection sites. Different BLA nuclei contribute projections to a variety of cortical and subcortical sites, including nucleus accumbens, the prefrontal cortex, the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, the ventromedial hypothalamus and central amygdala. To determine the projection sites of the different subsets of cells identified in Aim #1, rats will be implanted with stimulating electrodes in different BLA projection sites while recording BLA cells in the RRI task. Finally, in Aim 3, we will test whether specific subsets of BLA neurons, as defined by their projection sites and increased activity in relation to particular behaviors, actually contribute to generate these behaviors. Here, building on the results of Aim 2, we will infuse CAV2-Cre in different projection sites of BLA nuclei and an AAV driving the expression of NpHR or ChR2 in specific BLA nuclei. Then, by delivering light stimuli of the appropriate wavelength, we will test whether we can respectively block or facilitate different conditioned behaviors in the RRI task. Our pilot data imply that even after experience has led to the potentiation of some sensory inputs to LA neurons, their coupling to emotional behaviors is not fixed. After completing the above work, we plan on examining the neural substrates of this flexibility, an endeavor of great translational significance."
"9253024","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Acute and chronic end stage lung disease (ESLD) are increasing healthcare problems. Currently, when mechanical ventilation fails only extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) systems with components designed and qualified for a few hours are available. These are often associated with serious complications and generally are restricted to bedside use. Like the further evolved field of mechanical circulatory support in response to refractory heart failure, a wearable, biocompatible integrated pump-lung would offer significant advantages to patients over existing options. Such a device might would pose a prolonged ambulatory platform for natural lung healing from acute injury, a bridge to transplant or destination therapy, or for novel lung regenerative therapies. With support from the NHLBI, we have made remarkable progress in development of a novel artificial pump-lung (APL) device for ambulatory respiratory support. The technology is near ready to be translated to the clinics for human use The goal of this translational research is to complete development of the advanced prototypical pump lung (APL) for ambulatory use in a first-in-human (FIM) trial. The APL will be joined with cannulae and a portable driver consisting of electronics, battery and oxygen source as an artificial pump lung system (APLS). The APLS will undergo preclinical validation and testing per FDA guidelines to receive an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). Four specific aims of the proposal are: (1) to complete development of the preclinical APLS, including the APL, cannulae, diagnostic sensors and a portable driver, and develop enabling technologies; (2) to develop processes and tools for manufacturing clinical grade APLS; (3) to qualify the APLS for clinical use in an FDA approved first-in-human study; and (4) to conduct a First-in-Human trial of the APLS to measure effect of treatment, basic safety and human response factors. The successful completion of these specific aims should result in a keystone respiratory support system that will, like the introduction of ventricular assst devices (VAD) for heart failure 20 years earlier, be a new therapeutic option for those with morbid, acute, and chronic pulmonary illnesses. The quality of life for the patients will be dramatically improved with the ambulatory and out of hospital use APLS"
"9272823","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most frequently observed cause of dementia and cognitive decline associated with neurodegeneration. Current therapies provide modest improvement in cognitive function in some patients, while providing no efficacy in others. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system and glutamatergic transmission is severely disrupted in AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. Among the principle cognitive deficits associated with AD are deficiencies in hippocampal-mediated learning and memory. Glutamatergic neurotransmission is critical in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and hippocampal-dependent cognitive function and accumulating evidence suggests that enhancement of glutamatergic neurotransmission could help to reverse cognitive deficits associated with AD. In recent years, a specific subtype of metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor, termed mGlu5, has emerged as an exciting target for new therapeutic agents that could be used to reduce impaired cognitive function in patients suffering from AD and other neurodegenerative disorders. The mGlu5 receptor is the most highly expressed mGlu receptor subtype in the hippocampus and cortical regions that are impacted in AD patients, and plays a major role in the regulation of forms of synaptic plasticity that are believed to underlie learning and memory and other aspects of cognitive function. Furthermore, activation of mGlu5 can induce non-pathologic processing of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to reduce brain levels of A?. Interestingly, evidence suggests that mGlu5 signaling is impaired in tissue from AD patients. These studies raise the exciting possibility that  highly selective activators of mGlu5 could provide a novel approach to reverse the cognitive impairments and reduce some of the pathophysiological changes that are associated with AD. While initial attempts to develop selective orthosteric agonists of individual mGlu receptor subtypes were unsuccessful, we and others have been highly successful in discovery of selective positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) for mGlu5. These PAMs do not activate the mGlu receptors directly but potentiate glutamate-induced activation, thus preserving spatio-temporal signaling of the endogenous ligand. We now propose a series of studies aimed at fully characterizing the in vivo efficacy of mGlu5 PAMs to restore deficits in synaptic and cognitive function in the CK-p25 mouse model of AD. CK- p25 mice provide a preclinical model of AD that displays a number of pathological features that bear a striking similarity to those observed in AD patients, including neurodegeneration, increased tau phosphorylation and neurofibrillary tangles, elevated amyloid-beta protein (A?) and the amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing enzyme, ?-secretase (BACE1), as well as pronounced deficits in synaptic and cognitive function. This provides an excellent model that is well suited for testing the hypothesis that mGlu5 PAM will have efficacy in improving synaptic plasticity, cognitive function, and other pathological changes that are characteristic of human AD and neurodegenerative disorders."
"9293940","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD), a progressive neurodegenerative disease, is characterized by impairments in memory and cognition, neuronal loss and deposition of A? peptides. Early-onset familial AD [FAD] is caused by inheritance of mutated genes encoding presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 variants. The central thesis of our proposal is that in AD, cellular mechanisms responsible for the proliferation and differentiation o hippocampal neural progenitor cells (HNPCs) towards neurogenic fates are impaired, thus resulting in memory impairments in patients. Consistent with this view, we have demonstrated that ubiquitous expression of human FAD-linked PS1 variants in transgenic mice impairs environmental enrichment (EE)-induced hippocampal NPC proliferation and neurogenesis (Choi et al., 2008). Moreover, the effects of expressing mutant PS1 on HNPC phenotypes are driven by non-cell autonomous processes that involve factors released by other cells in the neurogenic microenvironment. Our studies also highlight the importance of microglial cells in mediating the effects of expressing mutant PS1 as these cells secrete factors that impair proliferation and neuronal lineage commitment of PS1hWT NPCs in vitro and transcripts encoding these factors are altered in microglia purified from mice expressing mutant PS1 following EE. These findings suggest that FAD-linked mutant PS1 impair NPC phenotypes in vivo by cell-non autonomous mechanisms that are mediated, at least in part, by microglia. Our Specific Aims are focused on elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of FAD-linked PS1 on proliferation and differentiation of adult hippocampal NPCs. Specific Aim 1: To assess the secretome of neonatal microglia from mice expressing PS1hWT or FAD-linked PS1 mutants and to assess the role of microglia in mediating the effects of mutant PS1 on EE-mediated AHNPC proliferation and differentiation deficits in vivo. Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of CC11-CCR3 signaling in mediating the effects of mutant PS1 on NPC deficits in vitro and in vivo."
"9311417","Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are the leading known and preventable causes of intellectual disability. They impair executive functions including working memory, a function highly dependent on the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC). This brain region is one of the last to mature, the third trimester in humans and the first 10 days after birth in rats. This is a vulnerable period for mPFC dendrites where their growth is prone to disruption from environmental insults, such as ethanol (EtOH). Poly ADP ribose polymerases (PARP) proteins are implicated in several cellular functions, including regulating gene expression. PARP synthesizes and attaches poly (ADP-ribose) (PAR) chains (PARylating) to its targets. PARP enzymes can affect gene expression by PARylating the epigenetic enzyme KDM4D. This reduces KDM4D?s ability to remove the transcriptionally repressive, dimethylated lysine 9 at histone H3 (H3K9me2). PARP-mediated gene silencing can also be accomplished by PARylating the transcription factor Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR?). Our underlying hypothesis is that EtOH induces PARP1 activity, promoting the addition of PAR groups to known PARP1 targets such as PPAR? and KDM4D. This post-translational modification would then reduce PPAR? and KDM4D?s ability to bind DNA or chromatin resulting in changes to neurodevelopmental gene expression, dendritic arborization, and working memory. This hypothesis is supported by our preliminary data in which EtOH increased PARP activity and reduced Bdnf IV, IXa, and Klf4 mRNA expression in primary cortical neuron cultures. These changes were reversible with a PARP inhibitor. As a direct connection between PARP and PPAR? we found that PARP inhibition increased PPAR? binding to Bdnf IV and Klf4 promoters in vitro. In vivo, neonatal EtOH treatment induced PARP activity, and this coincided with a decrease in PPAR? DNA binding ability and reduced Bdnf IV mRNA expression. Thirty-one days after the final dose, the reduction in Bdnf IV expression persisted in EtOH exposed rats. In the first aim, we plan to dissect the molecular mechanisms connecting PARP to changes in developmental gene expression in the mPFC with a focus on neuron-specific changes. In order to establish the role of PARP in EtOH induced Bdnf and Klf4 gene expression silencing we will attempt to prevent expression changes by administering a PARP inhibitor ABT-888 to EtOH treated rats. We will also dissect whether PARP mediated transcriptional repression occurs via post-translational modifications to PPAR? and KDM4D using neuron cultures. In the second aim, we will establish the role of PARP in the much-replicated deficits in mPFC dendritic arborization and neuritogenesis observed in FASD models. In the third aim, we will study the role of PARP in third trimester equivalent EtOH exposure-induced spatial working memory deficits. PARP inhibitors are known to be neuroprotective, are currently undergoing clinical trials for other disorders, and cross the blood-brain barrier. Therefore, the results of these studies may be a promising avenue for future pharmacological development."
"9483407","DESCRIPTION (provided by the applicant): The goal of this SCOR is to take an interdisciplinary approach to studying an emerging and potentially important interaction between sex differences, hormonal status (e.g., progesterone - PRO), impulsivity, and drug-motivated behavior that could have important consequences for reducing two devastating forms of drug abuse, cigarette smoking and cocaine abuse. The central hypothesis is that reducing impulsivity will reduce drug-seeking behavior. Progesterone reduces impulsivity, and combined with drugs that have similar effects (e.g., atomoxetine - ATO), significant reductions in nicotine and cocaine  abuse may be achieved. PRO will also be tested in combination with drugs that show some effect for nicotine dependence, varenicline (VAR) in the animal project. Based on a growing literature on sex differences in drug abuse, there may be sex differences in the effect of single and combined treatments. The following are the Specific Aims of the SCOR:      1. Investigate sex differences in the effect of exogenous PRO compared to placebo on impulsivity and smoking cessation in clinical Project 1.      2. To study sex differences in the effect of exogenous PRO vs. placebo in combination with ATO vs. placebo on impulsivity and relapse to cocaine abuse in clinical Project 2.      3. To examine sex differences in an animal model of nicotine and cocaine relapse and impulsivity for nicotine or cocaine in rats treated with PRO alone and in combination with ATO and VAR. Another goal is to study endogenous PRO effects on nicotine or cocaine self-administration in pregnant rats during gestation (high PRO) and lactation (low PRO) compared with males and no pregnant females. This SCOR allows for an interdisciplinary and translational approach to accomplishing these aims. It also offers economic efficiency, an opportunity to exchange ideas and approaches with others who are involved with the SCOR."
"9262927","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Stable, high relaxivity MRI contrast agents Abstract Contrast agents play an important role in clinical magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). About one third of scans employ a contrast agent and these agents are almost exclusively gadolinium (Gd) based T1 agents that provide positive image contrast. However, Gd-based agents have been implicated in nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a debilitating and life threatening disorder. It is hypothesized that Gd release from the contrast agent is a causative factor. New contrast agents, either extracellular tracers or targeted molecular imaging agents, must address the risk of Gd toxicity. Two additional features are required to make this new contrast agent technology broadly applicable today and in the future. First, although the majority of clinical scans today ar performed at 1.5 Tesla, there is a steady increase in imaging performed at higher fields. T1 relaxivity (positive contrast) typically decreases with increasing field while T2 relaxation (signa loss) becomes more efficient. Successful strategies for increasing r1 at low fields can be detrimental at high fields. New agents should demonstrate improved relaxivity from 1.5T to 7T and higher fields relative to existing contrast media. Second, new applications in molecular imaging require bifunctional molecules: a targeting group like a peptide linked to contrast agent group. New contrast agents should be easily incorporated into molecular imaging probes without loss of their relaxometric properties. We have developed a platform technology based on the amino acid chelator DOTAla that addresses this problem in two ways. The DOTAla moiety is a macrocyclic chelator that forms Gd complexes that are extremely inert to decomplexation and transmetallation, and is comparable to the macrocyclic contrast agents used clinically in this regard. The Gd-DOTAla complex can be incorporated into peptides in a rigid fashion in order to generate contrast agents that have high relaxivity as a result of optimized correlation times and increased gadolinium content per molecule. Because DOTAla is an amino acid, the synthetic flexibility in creating multimeric, targeted, and/or multimodal probes is unlimited. Here we build on this technology platform to develop optimized bifunctional reagents that deliver enhanced relaxivity at high fields. In Aim 1 we take three complimentary approaches to synthesize compounds with enhanced relaxivity. In Aim 2 we will perform extensive biophysical characterization of the compounds prepared in Aim 1 using advanced magnetic resonance and computational techniques in order to create models that prospectively predict new compounds with optimized dynamics and relaxivity. We then demonstrate the broader utility of this optimized technology platform by preparing untargeted (Aim 3) and peptide-targeted (Aim 4) high relaxivity contrast agents, and characterize them in rodent models of brain cancer and stroke."
"9309947","7. Project Summary/Abstract Metazoan development, physiology, and evolution are all heavily founded on the activities of transcriptional cis-regulatory modules (CRMs), also known as enhancers. Unraveling the basis of their remarkable regulatory properties is thus a central goal of biological science. While the past decade has been an era of remarkable progress in the study of developmental enhancer modules, we are clearly still in our infancy in understanding exactly how an enhancer's various transcription factor (TF) inputs are properly integrated to generate a novel gene expression output. The research program we propose here is designed to address this fundamental problem directly. Specific Aim 1. Investigate the functional basis for conserved CRM grammar elements. Evolutionarily conserved grammar elements ? pairs of adjacent binding sites for two different TFs ? have emerged as the next frontier in understanding the extraordinary integrative capacity of enhancer modules. We have identified two such elements that mediate synergistic activation by the Achaete/Scute proneural proteins and Suppressor of Hairless, the transducing TF for the Notch signaling pathway. We will conduct a comprehensive series of in vitro and in vivo studies designed to eludicate the biochemical and functional basis of their cooperative action. Specific Aim 2. Elucidate the mechanistic basis of complex CRM activity patterns. Our previous studies have revealed the existence in the Drosophila genome of a large number of enhancer modules that drive expression patterns of surprising spatial and temporal complexity. This discovery raises several intriguing questions. How specifically are these complex patterns generated? Is there a logic that ties together the different components of such a pattern? Do the different subpatterns rely for their generation on distinct subelements of the enhancer? We will carry out detailed structure/function studies of selected sets of complex CRMs, with the goal of testing different models for how they synthesize their output patterns. Specific Aim 3. Investigate the nature and function of a novel conserved CRM in the Enhancer of split gene complex. We have recently identified a novel and deeply conserved enhancer module in the Enhancer of split complex [E(spl)-C]. It lies in an unusual location, and drives an exceptionally broad pattern of reporter gene expression that is unlike that of any other CRM in the Complex. The experiments proposed for Specific Aim 3 will investigate this module's function in detail, including the intriguing possibility that it serves more than one gene, and thus may help explain the long-term evolutionary stability of the E(spl)-C. Transcriptional regulatory sequences are critically important contributors to a broad spectrum of human disease states. By delving deeply into the mechanistic basis of enhancer specificity, our work will help illuminate how regulatory sequence variation affects enhancer output and hence human phenotype."
"9314012","Project Summary After obtaining a fellowship award from the American Heart Association, my interest in the link between diet and hypertension continued to grow. During my renal fellowship, I have presented the findings of my research as oral and poster presentations at national meetings. I have been fortunate to collaborate with experts in the fields of nutrition, epidemiology (Drs. Walter Willett and Eric Rimm) and hypertension (Dr. John Forman). Graduating with a Master in Medical Sciences from the Master's Program of Clinical and Translational Investigation at Harvard Medical School (HMS), I have continued several collaborations at Harvard facilities. These collaborations have culminated in the publishing of peer-review articles. Nearing the end of my fellowship, I was appointed as an Associate physician in the renal division at Brigham and Women's Hospital. My long-term career goal is to become an independent clinical investigator in the fields of nutrition and hypertension. To attain my academic career goal, my short-term goal is to continue my intense training in patient-oriented research. It is with an outstanding advisory committee of unique experts and detailed planned training activities, that the K23 grant will allow me to become an independent clinical investigator. Advanced coursework in nutritional epidemiology and the science of nutrition as well as leadership development workshops for physician-scientists at HMS, will ensure my development as a patient-oriented researcher. During the fellowship award, we found an 11% higher risk of hypertension with increasing potato consumption. We also found an increased cross-sectional relation between endothelial-dependent vasodilation (a test for endothelial function) and recent intake of potatoes in the Modifiable Effectors of Renin System Activation Treatment Evaluation (MODERATE) trial. Therefore, in this proposal, we intend to replicate our preliminary findings in a racially diverse prospective cohort: the Coronary Artery Disease Development in Young Adults (CARDIA; N=5,115 participants, 51.4% black) followed for more than 20 years with dietary questionnaires and physical exams. Also, we will analyze the association of potatoes intake in children and adolescents of two prospective longitudinal cohorts of children and adolescents, the Growing Up Today Studies (GUTS: N=16,882 and GUTS II: N=10,923) with the incidence of hypertension in young adulthood. To better understand the mechanism of the association of potatoes intake with hypertension, we will assess increasing intake of potatoes with inflammatory and endothelial function biomarkers in CARDIA as well as three longitudinal prospective cohorts of US women and men (Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II and Health Professional Follow-up Study). We also propose the Potatoes, Hypertension RIsk and Endothelial function Study (PHRIES) trial, a 4-week randomized crossover feeding trial, where we will examine the effects of one additional serving of boiled or baked potatoes (as pre-made meals) per day for one week, compared with one serving/day of a non-starchy vegetable on endothelial function and biomarkers of inflammation. We will also study the temporal trends in white potatoes intake before and after their re-institution in 2015 in the cash value voucher of the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)."
"9323751","The cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease (AD) correlates with tau pathology or CSF tau. However, the pathogenic tau species and the mechanisms underlying tau toxicity in AD remain elusive. Our recent study points to important pathogenic roles for aberrantly acetylated tau (ac-tau) species, whose levels are elevated in NFTs, and the elevation is associated with cognitive impairment in AD. A critical trigger of tau-mediated toxicity in AD is elevated somatodendritic tau. We showed that tau acetylation on K274 and K281 destabilizes the barrier in the axon initial segment (AIS) and elevates levels of somatodendritic tau. Mice expressing mutant tau that mimics acetylation (KQ) exhibited impaired synaptic plasticity and spatial memory. Our study further linked tau-mediated synaptic plasticity impairment with deficiency in KIBRA, post-synaptic scaffolding protein. While KIBRA is reduced in AD brains, elevating KIBRA expression prevented KQ-induced LTP deficits in rat neurons. We propose to further dissect the mechanisms underlying ac-tau-mediated deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory by combining human neuron and mouse models. In Aim 1, we will focus on the effects of ac-tau on the AIS, which plays a critical role in restricting axonal protein from somatodendritic compartments in human neurons. We will use our newly established inducible pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)-derived human neuron platform and CRISPR/cas9 genomic editing to establish isogenic lines that express acetyl-mimicking tau at endogenous levels. We will then collaborate with Dr. Ke Xu and use stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM) to image AIS structural proteins and tau distribution in axons and dendrites of human neurons at single-molecule resolution. In Aim 2, we will directly determine whether ac-tau gains access to dendritic spines by destabilizing the AIS using a combination of STORM and live imaging. In human iPSC neurons, we will assess the effects of ac-tau on microtubule dynamics and stability, particularly at AIS, using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. We will then compare the extent to which WT and KQ tau cross the AIS and determine whether restoring AIS barrier function specifically using caged taxol would normalize tau distribution. In Aim 3, we will dissect the post-synaptic mechanisms underlying tau-mediated synaptic plasticity and cognition. To determine if deficiency in KIBRA is a driver in tau-mediated synaptic deficits, we test if lowering KIBRA levels is sufficient to cause tau-mediated synaptic deficits by deleting one allele of KIBRA in mice expressing human wildtype tau. Various domains of KIBRA interact directly with postsynaptic proteins, including PICK1, synaptopodin, dendrin, dynein, and PKM?, to regulate actin cytoskeleton and/or AMPAR trafficking. Using KIBRA mutants containing specific signaling domains, we propose to identify which KIBRA-mediated signaling plays a critical role in tau-mediated synaptic toxicity. By combining mechanistic dissection in human iPSC-derived neurons and in vivo circuit studies in mouse models, we expect to gain novel insights that can be translated into therapies to counteract tau-mediated cognitive decline."
"9335776","  Project Summary: The primary goal of this R21 application is to establish the concurrent and discriminant validity of physical and mental fatigability domains of the Pittsburgh Fatigability Scale (PFS) across disorders common in late life in which fatigue is most prevalent. Fatigue is a common complaint of older adults and is associated with chronic diseases, functional limitations,1-3 depressive symptoms,4 and mortality risk.5-11 Despite its prognostic importance, measuring fatigue has proven methodologically challenging.5,6,12,13 The concept of fatigability addresses these challenges by anchoring perceived exertion to a specific activity for a specific intensity and duration.6 Recent efforts to develop a self-report measure of physical and mental fatigability in healthy older adults have resulted in PFS.12 Higher PFS physical fatigability scores12 are associated with greater perceived exertion and poorer physical performance. To date, however, little is known about 1) the PFS mental fatigability domain, specifically its neuropsychological and behavioral correlates and how it relates to physical fatigability, and 2) the validity of the use of the PFS in clinical populations common in later life. In this R21 we will validate the PFS by testing associations of its physical and mental domains with physical and cognitive performance, neuropsychological functioning and depression severity in participants with depression, amnestic MCI, and/or fatigue. Cognitive performance decrements on sustained cognitive tasks have been ascribed to mental fatigue,16-20 a phenomenon associated with decrements in physical performance as well.21 Older adults, susceptible to physical fatigability,6,12-14 may also be susceptible to mental fatigability15 as a result of the increased neural activity required to maintain cognitive performance in later life.16,22-30 Understanding the relationship between mental and physical fatigability on the PFS and their relationships to cognitive and physical performance may help identify the pathophysiological mechanisms of these constructs. Validation of the PFS however requires an investigation of the measure's performance in clinical populations in whom fatigue is highly prevalent (Aim 2). Older adults with depressive illness31-35 and mild cognitive impairment (MCI)36,37 represent two such populations, yet little is known about fatigability in older adults with depression or CI. We will recruit 120 adults aged > 65 years with subjective complaints of fatigue (n = 40 with subjective complaints of fatigue and no depression or CI; n = 40 with aMCI and no depression; n = 40 with depression without aMCI). Participants will undergo an assessment of physical performance (measures of gait kinematics, EMG, force plate, and metabolic data with perceived exertion during a 16-min walk) and cognitive performance (N-back and effort-discounting tasks, episodic memory, executive functioning, and processing speed). Validation of the PFS is necessary to 1) investigate the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of physical and mental fatigability across clinical populations and 2) to develop innovative interventions targeting these mechanisms."
"9269948","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hospitals caring for elderly Medicare beneficiaries face unprecedented pressure to reduce unwanted practice variation and costs of hospitalization. To achieve these goals in surgical care, a growing number have introduced Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocols -- multidisciplinary bundles of surgical, anesthetic, nursing, and medical care intended to reduce the physiologic stress of surgery. In studies from highly specialized centers where they were developed, ERAS protocols have achieved faster recovery and shorter length of stay after major inpatient surgery. Yet it remains unclear whether such protocols improve costs and outcomes of surgical episodes overall, or simply shift them from the hospital to outpatient setting. Further, it is unknown whether ERAS will be effective for the most vulnerable patients, especially older adults with multiple comorbid conditions, who account for an increasing share of major surgery and often require ancillary care services after index hospitalization. Capitalizing on the unique data infrastructure in the state of Michigan, wit rich surgical outcomes, cost and utilization data, this proposal will evaluate ERAS in real-world surgical care, and assess its clinical, economic, and functional outcomes for frail and elderly patients. The specific research aims are to evaluate: (i) clinical outcomes of ERAS in real-world surgical practice; (ii) effects of ERAS on cost and utilization across the entire surgical episode; and (iii) differential effects of ERAS by age and comorbidity. As the first population-based assessment of ERAS protocols for inpatient surgery, this study will have immediate impact on efforts to improve efficiency of inpatient surgical care, and will provide a generalizable assessment of the viability of ERAS for value-based care delivery in US hospitals. Further, the research project, highly experienced multidisciplinary mentorship team, and unparalleled research environment are ideally suited to address the career goals and educational needs of the candidate, Scott Regenbogen, MD, MPH. The proposal includes a detailed educational plan with training that will be essential both for successful completion of this research and toward Dr. Regenbogen's career development in both health services and clinical aging research around geriatric surgery. The training includes graduate level courses in health care delivery systems, causal inference, and gerontology, as well as rotations in clinical geriatrics, with a focus on the acute and transitional care of complex elderly surgical patients. This career development award will lay the groundwork for Dr. Regenbogen to perform ongoing, innovative health services research, and to become an independent investigator and national leader in quality improvement around the unique needs of older adults undergoing major inpatient surgery."
"9021542","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Exposure to a traumatic event that causes extreme fear, horror or helplessness can lead to anxiety disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which can often be co-morbid with depression. Female Veterans who experienced Military Sexual Trauma (MST) are particularly at risk for a wide range of trauma- related mental and physical health problems including PTSD, depression, anxiety, chronic pain, sleep disturbances, substance abuse, wide-ranging physical symptoms, and negative health behaviors. Individual patients can vary in the degree to which they present with the different symptom clusters, such that a one size fits all treatment is often inadequate. This individual variation may be associated with biological risk factors that increase vulnerability to the disorder or impede treatment. While neurobiological factors (e.g., hormones, genomics) interact to increase an individual's risk of developing PTSD, it is unclear how the underlying neurobiology is shaped by these factors to result in the observed dysregulations. PTSD is marked by impaired cortical control of the limbic system, specifically the amygdala and hippocampus. Fear conditioning approaches have provided robust brain-based phenotypes of PTSD risk regardless of trauma type, as it is observed in both civilian and combat PTSD populations. The proposed study will capitalize on this observable marker and individual variability among women with MST to investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of PTSD as well as the utility of this phenotype to predict treatment response. Using state-of-the art molecular-genetic approaches with a mechanistic understanding of fear circuitry will offer tremendous insight into individual differences in risk and resilience to traum. Fear responses will be observed using a validated fear-potentiated startle paradigm that allows investigators to assess the acquisition, extinction, and return of conditioned fear responses. Hormonal contributions to heightened fear responding will be investigated by measuring estrogen variation in the female Veteran population to be included in this study. The ADCYAP1R1 gene, which codes for the type 1 receptor (PAC1) for pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is one of the leading candidate genes related to PTSD in traumatized women. This genetic polymorphism was identified using a hypothesis neutral genomic convergence approach, but has since been replicated in several different PTSD study populations. The proposed project will include the examination of PAC1 genotype, methylation status, mRNA expression, and estrogen variation on PTSD symptom expression as well as laboratory measures of fear and anxiety in an understudied population of female Veterans. Lastly, we will evaluate the predictive nature of the neurobiological indices to be included in the  proposed work as they relate to PTSD treatment outcome within the Trauma Recovery Program at the Atlanta VAMC."
"9206092","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Diarrhea is a predominant symptom of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) or intestinal infections caused by food-borne pathogens. Our veteran patient population is particularly more vulnerable to diarrheal illnesses due to their age and numerous co-morbidities. In spite of significant medical advances, the treatment of diarrheal disorders still remains challenging. Therefore, it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of diarrhea associated with these diseases. Diarrhea results from increased intestinal secretion and/or decreased absorption of water and electrolytes. A major route of electrolyte absorption in the human intestine involves coupled operation of Na+/H+ (NHE) and Cl-/HCO3- exchangers. Studies have shown NHE3 to play a critical role in mediating intestinal sodium absorption as NHE3 knockout mice exhibit diarrheal phenotype. Also, it has been shown that NHE3 KO mice are more susceptible to inflammation as NHE3 deficiency in these mice resulted in diarrhea associated with colitis. To date, however, very little is known about the molecular mechanisms involved in decreasing NHE3 expression in diarrheal disorders. In order to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the down-regulation of NHE3 expression in IBD-related diarrhea, our current studies are focused on the role of epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modifications shown to be implicated in the pathogenesis of IBD. Our extensive preliminary data provides strong evidence for the epigenetic regulation of NHE3 expression by changes in DNA methylation and histone modifications. Based on these data, we hypothesize that changes in DNA methylation, histone modifications and chromatin remodeling play important roles in modulating NHE3 gene expression that underlie the pathophysiology of diarrhea. The current application is, therefore, designed to investigate the regulation of NHE3 gene expression by DNA methylation and histone modifications utilizing both in vitro (Aims 1 & 2) and in vivo models (Aim 3) as follows: Aim 1. Elucidate in detail the effect of DNA methylation on NHE3 promoter activity, identify the specific CpG dinucleotide involved in the modulation of NHE3 promoter and determine the roles of DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) isoforms; Aim 2: Investigate the role of histone acetyl transferase, p300 & histone deacetylase (HDAC) isoforms in the modulation of NHE3 expression, changes in histone acetylation marks on NHE3 gene and chromatin remodeling in the stimulation of NHE3 expression; and Aim 3: Examine the regulation of NHE3 expression by epigenetic mechanisms under normal and inflammatory conditions utilizing wild type, DSS-induced colitis and NHE3 knockout mice (diarrheal phenotype). The outcome of these studies should provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of NHE3 and define important mechanistic link between alterations in DNA methylation/histone modifications of NHE3 gene and diarrhea associated with IBD. Also, these studies will establish for the first time the identity of a particular DNMT or HDAC isoforms involved in the dysregulation of NHE3 in diarrheal disorders."
"9352756","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Chronic musculoskeletal pain is a highly prevalent, debilitating condition with a paucity of effective treatments. Usually starting in midlife, it persists into late years, with up to 50% of people over 65 reporting persistent pain. Patients futilely attempt numerous treatments, including risky surgeries to alleviate pain. Recent studies suggest that the central nervous system- i.e., aberrantly functioning brain circuits -plays a role in the origin and maintenance of chronic pain. However, the specific mechanisms underlying central chronic pain are not yet fully understood. The PI of this project formulated evidence-based Developmental Theory of predisposition to central chronic pain. Insights from translational neuroscience suggest that pain and feelings of interpersonal rejection or abandonment share neural circuits, neurotransmitters, genetic and immune markers, and that interpersonal emotion regulation between child and caregivers is crucial for the optimal development of this shared system. Early interpersonal adversity may lead to its aberrant development causing increased sensitivity to pain and interpersonal distress, and difficulty down-regulating and differentiating between them, thus creating a vicious cycle of pain and interpersonal suffering, predisposing to chronic pain in later years. In fact, early interpersonal adversity and adult heightened rejection sensitivity and loneliness are highly prevalent among chronic pain patients. To study the neural bases of these phenomena, the PI developed a novel brain imaging (fMRI) paradigm that measures the extent of modulation of pain by feelings of rejection. Her preliminary studies suggest that (a) feelings of interpersonal rejection modulate pain on a neural level among healthy people, (b) this neural modulation is associated early interpersonal adversity, and (c) non-optimal early interpersonal environment is associated with increased pain sensitivity in adulthood in an animal model. The proposed study will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying effects of early interpersonal adversity and mid-life interpersonal distress on central pain processing among patients with chronic pain. Low back pain is a highly common pain problem and 20-40% of back surgeries for pain result in chronic post-operative pain (CPOP). Using CPOP as a model to differentiate between central nervous system vs structural spine factors contributing to low back pain, pre-surgery brain imaging fMRI scans will be used to study predisposition to CPOP among patients with varying levels of early interpersonal adversity and current interpersonal distress. This will be the first study to (a) investigate the specific effects of early life and adult interpersonal adversity on neural circuits underlying pain and (b) use brain imaging to predict CPOP. This award will also measurably advance the training of PI in aging research methodology and translational social affective neuroscience, and will launch her translational research program which aims at identifying targets for reversing the drastic effects of interpersonal adversity on chronic pain and health, and for development of prevention programs for this problem of significant public health importance."
"9472515","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We have described a novel clinical entity caused by JC virus (JCV) infection of cortical pyramidal neurons in an immunosuppressed individual. This patient presented with lesions restricted to the hemispheric gray matter on MRI, developed aphasia, progressive cognitive dysfunction and seizures and had a rapid fatal outcome. We called this disease JCV encephalopathy (JCVE), since it is distinct from Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by JCV infection of glial cells. Post mortem histological evaluation demonstrated for the first time a productive and lytic infection of cortical pyramidal neurons by JCV. We have analyzed the full length sequence of a molecular clone of JCV obtained from the brain of this patient, JCVCPN1, which revealed an archetype-like regulatory region (RR), and a novel 143 bp deletion in the Agnoprotein gene. The CPN mutant was subsequently found in the neurons or cerebrospinal fluid of three other patients with PML. We hypothesize that changes in JCV sequence are responsible for the specific infection of cortical pyramidal neurons in this patient. However, whether JCVCPN1 growth in neurons is made possible by its RR, the novel Agnoprotein deletion, or both, remains unclear. Furthermore, we postulate that JCV infection of cortical neurons may also occur in other individuals, including in PML patients with demyelinating lesions located at the gray white- junction or within the gray matter. Finally, we hypothesize that other pyramidal neurons, located in the hippocampus may also be infected by JCV variants, which could lead to the development of seizures. To test these hypotheses, we will pursue the following set of Specific Aims: Aim 1) Characterize the host cell range of JCVCPN1 in vitro Aim 2) Determine the contributions of the Agnoprotein deletion and archetype-like RR to the phenotype of JCVCPN1 in vitro Aim 3) Characterize the prevalence of JCV infection of cortical pyramidal neurons in archival samples from PML patients and identify the CPN1 mutation using immunohistochemistry and laser capture microdissection Aim 4) Investigate JCV infection of hippocampal pyramidal neurons in immunosuppressed individuals and in patients with hippocampal sclerosis or intractable epilepsy"
"9375287","Project Summary IgE antibodies play a central role in allergic diseases due to their ability to bind to high-affinity receptors on mast cells and induce degranulation upon allergen crosslinking1, 2. In spite of its powerful inflammatory effects, IgE is the antibody with the lowest serum concentration and the shortest half-life, and IgE-producing B lymphocytes are extremely rare in humans and mice, suggesting that IgE production is strongly regulated. The increased incidence of allergic diseases and its detrimental effects on public health brought renewed interest in understanding the regulation of IgE production. Furthermore, the positive effect of anti-IgE treatment on allergic asthma and other chronic allergic diseases validated IgE as a therapeutic target3. Studies from mouse models uncovered several mechanisms that restrain IgE production4, 5. The germinal center (GC) phase of IgE cells is prematurely terminated, and IgE GC cells do not generate IgE memory cells or long-lived IgE plasma cells6. Instead, the sequential switching of IgG cells to IgE originates most antigen-specific high affinity IgE plasma cells6, 7, 8. These findings have brought about a new understanding on the memory of IgE response, that is, that IgE memory is contained within IgG cells that under appropriate activation, can give rise to IgE plasma cells. Based on this novel model, we hypothesize that the potential for pathogenic IgE production resides in allergen- specific ?permissive? IgG memory cells that can be activated by ?permissive? CD4 memory T cells to switch to IgE. We propose to determine phenotypic, transcriptional, epigenetic and functional differences between total and antigen-specific IgG memory cells and CD4 memory T cells from atopic and non-atopic individuals. Through these studies we hope to identify ?permissive? memory B and T cells, and determine the risk of individuals producing pathogenic IgE. Understanding the regulation of IgE production in human subjects is of great importance to developing new therapies for allergic diseases."
"9360537","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): With the successful scale-up of HIV treatment in hyper-endemic settings, and a disease prevalence that may remain high for decades, comes a long-term healthcare commitment to an ageing HIV-infected population. As HIV-infected individuals live longer they will increasingly be affected by a double burden of both infectious and non-infectious diseases. We hypothesize that the current HIV-specific vertical programs are unlikely to maximize the total health of the HIV-positive individual and that in the coming years more integrated health care management - incorporating testing and treatment for diabetes, cancer, renal insufficiency, cardiovascular disease and hepatitis, among other conditions - will be needed both to stop these diseases from undermining HIV programs and to maintain and improve the reductions in mortality that have begun in hyper-endemic settings.  We know this shift in disease burden is coming, but we do not know its magnitude, timing or character in detail; nor are the implications of this shift well understood; no work has established the priorit that should be placed on potential changes in health system organization. The only tool available to examine these issues at a population-scale is mathematical modelling. Therefore, we propose to construct a new mathematical model for Zimbabwe, using data from a long-running population-based HIV cohort, to develop innovative translational analyses to inform the evolution the AIDS response must take. Our aims are: 1. To construct a multiple-disease model tailored specifically to the HIV hyper-endemic African setting of Zimbabwe. The model will build on existing analyses of demographic, epidemic and program changes occurring in Zimbabwe, incorporate interactions between HIV and ART with major non-communicable diseases in this population - diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, osteoporosis and mental health issues - and major infectious diseases - tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, herpes simplex virus, human papillomavirus, malaria, schistosomiasis. The model will also represent patterns of care-seeking behaviors and health system organization (screening different population, outreach to different group, integrating care across sectors to improve 'cascade' losses). 2. To use this model to forecast the changing disease burden in HIV-infected patients and the wider population. Specifically, the timing and scale of change and characterizing future patient profile (sex/age/multi-morbidities). 3. Identify optimal mode of integration of services across health areas. What screening and additional services will be required, for which patients; which demographics should outreach campaigns prioritize; where would integration of services and strengthening of the cascade of care be most valuable; what impact would these changes have on population health."
"9274828","The enteric nervous system (ENS) is a heterogeneous neuronal network that lines the gut and controls intrinsic gastrointestinal (GI) function. Excitatory and inhibitory neurogenic signaling controls smooth muscle contractions and relaxations respectively, regulating the process of peristalsis. Selective loss of inhibitory motor neurons disrupts the balance of contractions and relaxations and creates permanent impairments in gut motility in functional gastrointestinal disorders like inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS). Yet, the exact mechanisms that contribute to this neuropathy are still unclear. Oxidative stress in the ENS is a key factor associated with enteric neuron death in intestinal and is regulated by enteric glial cells; a unique class of peripheral glia that surround and support and maintain the neuronal extracellular environment. My central hypothesis is that a combination of high glial nitric oxide (oxidant) production and/or low glial glutathione (antioxidant) production contributes to neuron death during inflammation. We will test this hypothesis in two specific aims. Specific Aim 1 will determine the mechanisms that regulate glial NO during intestinal inflammation. Specific Aim 2 will determine how changes in glial glutathione (GSH) production contribute to enteric neurodegeneration during intestinal inflammation. In investigating these aims, I will generate transgenic mouse models using viral knockdowns, and use immunohistochemistry, live-cell fluorescent imaging and in vivo and in situ models of enteric neuron loss to understand the mechanisms of glial oxidative balance regulation. Understanding the role of glial cells in regulating oxidative balance during intestinal inflammation will identify novel molecular targets for the development of therapeutics for GI disorders."
"9434524","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The career goal of the K01 candidate is to become an independent investigator conducting research that contributes to the prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia through elucidating disease mechanisms and deriving individual risk profiles during the preclinical stage of the disease. The environment at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School is ideal for the candidate's training and proposed research, providing state-of-the-art imaging facilities and a world-renowned community of AD researchers and clinicians. During this K award, the candidate will extend her expertise in multimodal neuroimaging by receiving training in Tau PET imaging, and acquire expertise in genetic analyses to pursue a novel research path. The research plan proposed herein examines the influence of known genetic risk factors, specifically the APOE4 genotype and 21 non-APOE loci associated with clinical AD in large GWAS analyses, on the relationship between AD biomarkers and cognitive decline in clinically normal older individuals (CN). An understanding of genetic risk factors within CN is especially relevant given the ability to select CN with biomarker evidence of elevated A? (preclinical AD). Although longitudinal studies have converged to reveal that CN with preclinical AD are at heightened risk of subsequent clinical impairment, heterogeneity in decline exists within this group, such that some of these individuals remain clinically normal for an extended period of time. Identification of genetic risk factors that influence the time between initial A? accumulation and the onset of clinical symptoms will greatly enhance our understanding of preclinical AD and improve our ability to identify individuals most at- risk for cognitive decline. Although some of the effects of known genetic risk factors for AD dementia are undoubtedly mediated by elevated A?, we hypothesize that these factors also influence the AD trajectory by interacting with A? to accelerate downstream effects such as the accumulation of neocortical Tau, neurodegeneration, and cognitive decline. Thus, for an equivalent level of A? burden, an individual with high genetic risk may show greater neurodegeneration than an individual with low genetic risk. This line of research should provide insight into why some A?+ individuals are able to remain clinically normal for longer periods of time whereas other A?+ individuals rapidly progress to clinical impairment. We will investigate these hypotheses in a large sample of 1777 CN combined across the Harvard Aging Brain Study (N=277), the Anti- Amyloid in Asymptomatic AD Study (A4, N=1000) and Longitudinal Evaluation of Amyloid Risk and Neurodegeneration Study (LEARN, N=500). All CN will complete amyloid PET, structural MRI, genotyping data, and longitudinal neuropsychological testing, and a large subset will additionally complete Tau PET imaging (N=827). Because disease-modifying strategies are most likely to be successful during the preclinical stage, elucidating AD disease mechanisms and deriving individual risk profiles during the preclinical stage will have tremendous impact on the prevention of AD."
"9268570","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Major advances have been made in the last 25 years in our understanding of the pathogenesis of childhood asthma. Strong evidence from several birth cohorts indicates that most cases of persistent childhood asthma start in the first 3 years o life; that the disease first manifests as rhinovirus-positive wheezing lower respiratory illnesses (WLRI); and that it is strongly associated with early allergic sensitization. It has also been show that both the non-reversible changes in lung function associated with the more severe forms of childhood asthma and the initial signs of airway remodeling first appear during the preschool years. Recent epidemiological studies have shown that settings and dwellings that increase bacterial exposure in early life are protective against early WLRI and asthma, but the specific components responsible for this protection are unknown. Oral lyophilized, detoxified extracts of eight pathogenic bacteria (Bronchovaxom(r)) have been used empirically in Europe for the prevention of respiratory illnesses. Recent studies in preschoolers with asthma-like symptoms have suggested that Bronchovaxom has a strong effect in the prevention of WLRI. We propose the Oral Bacterial Extracts (ORBEX): Primary Prevention of Asthma and Wheezing in Children trial to test the hypothesis that Bronchovaxom, given to 6-18 month old children at high risk for asthma, can prevent the development of persistent wheezing by age 3.5-4.5 years. We will perform a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two arm clinical trial with a total of 1076 children with the following specific aims: 1. To evaluate if Bronchovaxom(r) given to high risk infants for 10 days monthly for two consecutive years can increase time to occurrence of the first WLRI episode during a third observation year after therapy (primary outcome) and whether the rate of WLRI will be reduced after therapy. 2. To determine if: Bronchovaxom(r) can reduce the time to occurrence and the rate of WRLI while the participants are receiving study drug during the initial two years of the study; can reduce the time to occurrence and rates of severe WLRI both during therapy and during the observation year after therapy; can reduce asthma-like symptoms using `episode-free days' during both the two years on study drug and during the observation year after therapy. 3. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the sustained use of Bronchovaxom(r) in infancy through the preschool years."
"9305292","Project Summary / Abstract Communication likely first evolved on our planet as chemical signals between single-cell microorganisms. A fundamental purpose for this type of communication in modern microorganisms is to allow these microbes to self-organize into functional communities. Colonies of the budding yeast, S. cerevisiae, provide an opportunity to investigate this type of community organization due to this model organism's peerless genome annotation and genetic malleability. The Honigberg lab discovered that diploid yeast colonies are organized into a layer of feeder cells underlying a layer of meiotic (sporulating) cells. Furthermore, the relative number of cells and dimensions of the two layers depends on colony environment. Feeder cells may stimulate sporulation in the overall community by providing nutrients to the cells of the overlying layer.  In addition to its scientific interest, the health relevance of the proposed research derives from the fact that the spatial organization of pathogenic yeast biofilms contributes significantly to the lethality of hospital-acquired fungal infections. Furthermore, mechanisms of microbial community organization could help elucidate the forces driving organization of tissues and tumors in humans.  A long-range goal of the Honigberg lab is to identify the mechanisms that regulate the self- organization of yeast colonies from homogeneous to highly patterned communities. The first specific aim of the application is to test the ?Differential Partitioning provides Environmental Buffer? hypothesis by determining whether the number of feeder cells in colonies correlates with the dependency on these feeder cells for sporulation across a range of conditions. In addition, we will determine whether establishing and maintaining differential partitioning depends on both cell autonomous and cell nonautonomous mechanisms. The second specific aim is to characterize feeder cells with respect to the similarity of expression patterns to quiescent cells found in cultures, and to test the hypotheses that the number of feeder cells in colonies responds to the respiratory state of the colony through mitochondrial signaling.  Three complementary approaches are employed to address the above hypotheses. The first approach measures expression of known feeder-cell specific or sporulation-specific genes within intact wild- type or mutant colonies by confocal or multi-photon fluorescent microscopy, and to measure co-localization of these genes in cell populations from resuspended colonies. The second approach examines partitioning and other markers of colony development across a 2-D environmental landscape, i.e. when two environmental conditions (such as temperature or concentration of nutrients) are both varied. The third approach compares gene expression patterns in feeder and sporulation cell layers using FACS-Seq."
"9323239","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein aggregation is a feature of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the transthyretin (TTR) amyloidoses. TTR is a tetrameric protein secreted into the blood by the liver. Compelling evidence suggests that peripheral neurodegeneration in the TTR amyloidoses results from rate- limiting TTR tetramer dissociation, aberrant monomer misfolding and misfolded TTR assembly into a spectrum of TTR aggregate structures. Extracellular aggregation leads to proteotoxicity in tissues not synthesizing TTR by a cell non-autonomous process that we seek to understand via the proposed experiments, and which is not understood for any aggregation-associated neurodegenerative disease. In humans, WT TTR aggregation leads to a cardiomyopathy, whereas aggregation of other TTR mutations leads to a primary neuropathy. Herein, we report the development and partial characterization of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models of the TTR amyloidoses, exhibiting TTR aggregation and three cell non-autonomous quantifiable neuronal TTR proteotoxicity-associated cellular and sub-cellular phenotypes with direct relevance to human disease. We will characterize TTR mRNA levels and TTR conformations including tetramers, and misfolded TTR oligomers in these models as a function of aging and correlate these with the neuronal phenotypes observed. Defects in microtubule-based trafficking appear to be a centrally important mechanistic feature of TTR proteotoxicity. The availability of novel small molecule and genetic tools to quantify TTR conformation, as well as the ability to image sub-cellular phenotypes in a single neuron as a function of aging in the same living worm to quantify phenotypic changes affords us an extraordinary opportunity to understand the cell biology and biochemistry of neurodegeneration. Access to the drug tafamidis, which dramatically slows progression of the TTR amyloidoses in humans will also allow us to discern how inhibition of TTR aggregation alters the cell biological and biochemical defects apparently underlying neurodegeneration in these models. To further understand the mechanisms of TTR proteotoxicity at the cellular and molecular level, we will search for modulators of TTR proteotoxicity by identifying suppressors of a locomotion defect exhibited by one of our TTR models in a unbiased forward genetic screen. We have identified candidate suppressors in a pilot screen and showed that some exhibited proper TTR synthesis and secretion, suggesting that this screen could identify tissue specific molecular targets that are relays between the formation of extracellular TTR aggregates and cellular toxicity. These studies will establish TTR C. elegans models as relevant to the study of cell non-autonomous TTR toxicity."
"9275323","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a multifactorial autoimmune disease in which autoantibodies (autoAbs) play a key role in eliciting tissue destruction. Multiple immune irregularities have been identified, including hyperactivity of T and B cells, in patients with SLE but its pathogenesis remains an enigma. This gap in knowledge is a significant impediment to timely diagnosis, early therapeutic intervention and potential prevention. We propose a highly innovative pathogenic model that links irregularities typical of patients with SLE including the presence of autoAbs several years prior to manifestation of clinical disease, the presence of large immune complexes (ICs) and autoAbs targeting apoptotic debris in the circulation, the production of higher levels of type I interferons (IFNs) and their target genes, and the hyperactivity of B and T cells. The central component of the proposed hypothetical model is that the tolerogenic capacity of marginal zone macrophages (MZMs) in the marginal zone (MZ) of the spleen plays a pivotal role in the progression of SLE. We propose that there is a gradual erosion of the normally large reserve in the tolerogenic capacity of the MZMs during the pre-clinical disease phase of SLE. When the tolerogenic capacity of the MZMs declines below a critical threshold, the individual becomes susceptible to inciting events, especially those that induce type I IFNs, that precipitate a further rapid loss of tolerogenic capacity resulting in production of high titers of pathogenic autoAbs and clinical disease. We further propose that the erosion of the tolerogenic capacity of the MZMs during the pre-clinical state is driven primarily by circulating apoptotic cell antigens (AC-Ags) and IgG ICs that enhance immunogenic signals which in combination with type I IFN pathways reduce the tolerogenic capacity of MZMs.        At the molecular level, we propose that the loss of the tolerogenic capacity of the MZMs is associated with an increase in expression of Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) in MZMs in response to AC-Ag/ICs. As the expression of Btk is further increased, the MZMs will relocate from their anatomic position adjacent to the FO and locate to more remote areas of the MZ. Some individuals develop ICs that increase type I IFN signaling and Btk induction in MZMs to the point that a threshold is reached at which a pro-inflammatory trigger precipitates the onset of clinica disease.    * Aim 1 will determine if autoAb-ICs induction of Btk leads to MZM dysfunction and loss.    * Aim 2 will determine if IFN? and ICs work together to break MZM tolerance.    * Aim 3 will determine if elevation of pBtk leads to loss of MZ macrophages, development of  inflammatory macrophages and elevation of type I IFN genes in SLE patients.        The proposed work will use state-of-art confocal imaging and high dimension phospho-flow cytometry analyses to enable detection of the aberrant signaling events associated with loss of function and numbers of MZMs due to abnormally upregulated pBtk in both humans and mice. We will also apply B cell tetramer technology to enable tracking the development of pathogenic multireactive autoAb forming B cells associated with the decline of MZM numbers and tolerance function. Btk activity will be manipulated by systemic treatment of mice with an irreversible Btk inhibitor, PCI-32765 or liposome gene therapy to directly target Btk shRNA or PCI-32765 to MZMs.        Significance: This hypothetical model, if proven true, would pinpoint a defining event in the transition from pre-clinical to clinical SLE, which would suggest a biomarker that could be used in earlier diagnosis of SLE, i.e., the numbers and Btk phenotype of the MZMs in experimental models of autoimmunity, and the Btk phenotype of PBMCs from patients. This would have major implications in terms of earlier and thus more effective intervention using currently available therapeutic strategies. In addition, the results will provide insights critical to the development f Btk as a potential therapeutic target in SLE."
"9311230","Role of PTEN in Mitosis and Chromosome Stability Project Summary The chromatin environment shapes DNA-based processes and recent studies reveal that the PTEN tumor suppressor con- trols both DNA duplication/segregation and chromatin remodeling. A fundamental question is how PTEN mediates the interplay between the genome and the epigenome to ensure faithful transmission of genetic materials. Our long-term goal is to illuminate the function of PTEN in maintaining mitotic chromosome stability and to understand why this function is a major driving force in tumor suppression. The overall objective of this project is to identify critical regulatory elements in both mitosis-intrinsic machinery and global chromatin architecture that work together under the control of PTEN to promote mitotic fidelity. In support of this goal, our recent studies show that depletion of PTEN results in spindle shorten- ing and pole fragmentation, accompanied by misalignment and non-disjunction of chromosomes, leading to catastrophic mitotic failure and polyploidy. These observations suggest that PTEN is directly involved in mediating the interaction be- tween chromosomes and the mitotic spindle. In addition, metaphase cells lacking PTEN exhibit prominent chromosome entanglement, centromere breakage, and acentric anaphase bridges, indicating structural chromosome instability likely due to impaired chromatin architecture. Interestingly, our published data demonstrate that PTEN regulates histone anchor- age and modification on chromatin and thereby affects the chromatin compaction status. These results collectively support our hypothesis that PTEN maintains structural and numerical chromosome stability by coordinating mitotic chromatin compaction and mitotic spindle assembly for proper chromosome alignment and segregation. We will test this hypothesis by pursuing two specific aims. In the first aim, we will demonstrate impairment of mitotic chromatin compaction and epi- genetic deregulation of kinetochore assembly as a prevailing phenotypic consequence of PTEN dysfunction. High- resolution imaging and biochemical approaches, in combination with knock-in animal models developed in our laborato- ry, will be used to analyze PTEN function in promoting mitotic chromatin condensation. In the second aim, we will delin- eate the mechanism underlying the functional interaction among interrelated PTEN pathways in governing spindle activity and chromosome behavior. Using a comprehensive set of cellular and molecular biology approaches, coupled with newly generated transgenic mouse strains, we will depict a PTEN-associated mitotic signaling network comprised of both struc- tural and functional regulatory elements that act in concert to guard the genome. Successful completion of these aims will fundamentally advance our mechanistic understanding of the multifaceted function of PTEN in mitosis and chromosome stability. Data from our studies will illustrate how PTEN deficiency triggers a deteriorative interaction between deregulat- ed mitotic machinery and unfavorable chromatin milieus, leading to structural and numerical chromosome aberrations. Newly discovered mitotic pathways and targets in this innovative project will contribute to precision medicine through tailoring targeted therapies based on the genetic and epigenetic signatures of each cancer patient."
"9258443","?

Over the past three decades the University of Utah School of Medicine (UUSOM), which includes the Department of Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences and the Moran Eye Center, has built a dynamic research community that addresses the full range of eye-related health issues. Faculty members' grant-funded research spans the continuum of T1-T4 translational science and is supported by numerous institutional programs. A large number of our medical students are interested in eye health, as evidenced by 29% regularly participating in monthly meetings of the medical student-run Ophthalmology Interest Group and 8% of the 2015 graduating class matching in Ophthalmology residency programs. In addition, faculty members have extensive experience in successfully mentoring trainees, helping to build the physician-scientist, and scientifically minded physician, workforce. Thus, the UUSOM is an ideal location to offer outstanding short-term research experiences for medical students.  The goal and objectives of the new Medical Student Research Program in Eye Health and Disease (MSRP- EHD) are to: GOAL: Ignite in medical students a life-long interest in conducting or collaborating in research related to the eye, while also building their skills in creative and critical thinking. Objective 1 Engage 6 medical students/year in the exciting foundational, clinical and translational science discoveries taking place at the University of Utah. Trainees will participate in a mentored, 11-week summer research experience between their first and second years of medical school. Objective 2: Stimulate the development of trainees' creative and critical thinking skills through an innovative course that will be part of the summer experience. Objective 3: Encourage each trainee to discover the type of research he or she is most interested in pursuing as a physician.  Fifteen faculty mentors have agreed to participate in the program.

"9275429","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The amyloid plaques made of Ab peptide and neurofibrillary tangles made of abnormal tau protein define the neuropathology of Alzheimer's disease. Many diverse studies support an initiating role for amyloid in Alzheimer's disease. However, these findings also clearly demonstrate both that the presence of tau is required for amyloid mediated neuronal dysfunction and that pathological tau protein causes neurodegeneration. Furthermore, pathological tau, including neurofibrillary tangles, characterizes the neuropathology of blast induced traumatic brain injury, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, and other related tauopathies. Traumatic brain injury is increasingly prevalent in the Veteran population. Both aging related changes and brain injury dramatically increase the risk for neurodegenerative dementia disorders. Thus it is imperative we develop treatments that can quickly bridge the gap between bench and bedside. Development of pharmacological interventions for tau mediated neurodegeneration is the long-term goal of this research project. Our drug discovery strategy employs an integrated approach aimed at expediting drug repurposing. Our previously published work demonstrated the effectiveness of these methods by screening a library of 1120 approved drugs to identify a single validated compound capable of ameliorating tau pathology in a transgenic mouse model of tauopathy. We now propose to extend this drug repositioning approach to a drug collection spanning most of the drugs with a history of clinical use (~5400 drugs). The objectives of this project are to: Identify compounds reducing tau aggregation in a transgenic C. elegans model of tauopathy and in a human cell culture model of tau aggregation; Prioritize hits based on their CNS penetration and identify dosing and routes of administration that modulate pathological tau in young mice; Use novel compounds identified above to intervene in symptomatic tauopathy mice. Completion of these studies will reveal FDA approved candidate drugs for use as tau targeted therapeutics for both Alzheimer's disease and blast induced traumatic brain injury, providing justification for the clinical testing of repurposed approved drugs for treatment of tauopathy disorders."
"9205175","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Treating chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with inhaled glucocorticosteroids has been convincingly shown to increase their risk of pneumonia, but the responsible mechanisms are undefined. Work from this laboratory suggests a possible mechanism, related to the increased numbers of cells dying by apoptosis in the lungs in COPD, especially in emphysema. Uptake of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) suppresses the ability of alveolar macrophages (AMØ) to fight infections. By markedly increasing AMØ efferocytosis, glucocorticoids plus apoptotic cells cause greater immune defects than either stimulus alone. This effect is called glucocorticoid-augmented efferocytosis (GCAE). MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are 19-25 nucleotide-long non-coding RNAs that coordinately target large numbers of genes and reduce their protein products. Preliminary data imply that defective AMØ function is caused by down-regulation of specific miRNAs by GCAE (but not by apoptotic cells alone or glucocorticosteroids alone). The long-term goal of this project is to develop novel, inhalational treatments, based on transient over-expression of these specifically decreased miRNAs, to reverse defective AMØ immune function when COPD patients taking inhaled glucocorticoids present with community-acquired pneumonia. This project will use ex vivo investigation of AMØ from both smoke-exposed mice and human volunteers (including active smokers and patients with COPD), and an established murine model of pneumococcal pneumonia. Its immediate goals are to: (a) confirm that GCAE increases pneumococcal pneumonia risk and severity, and in the process, validate a murine model for testing strategies to reverse those defects; (b) define  GCAE-induced defects in human AMØ functionally and by whole- transcriptome analysis, identifying genes uniquely regulated by the GCAE x pneumococcus interaction; (c) validate and optimize miRNA-over-expression to reverse the adverse effects of GCAE on AMØ defensive functions. Successful completion of this project could lead to more precisely personalized therapies and better outcomes in COPD, currently the third leading cause of death in the USA, and the most expensive-to-treat chronic disease on a per-case basis among Veterans."
"9232955","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): CADENCE-Adults is an R01 study that will calibrate cadence (steps/min) and intensity in 260 ambulatory adults, 10 men and 10 women for each 5-year age-group category between 21-85 years, effectively covering the adult lifespan. Cadence is one of the temporal-spatial parameters of gait. Cadence multiplied by stride length equals speed. Capture and expression of objectively monitored physical activity in terms of cadence represents an overlooked opportunity to represent free-living patterns of ambulatory intensity. There is merit in being able to translate technological and analytical advances into more accessible terms, especially if public health goals are to be realized. Cadence represents a minimally processed and translatable metric that could be collected and interpreted across objective instruments, including those used in the lab, in the clinic, and in the real world. The primary aim of CADENCE-Adults is to identify objectively observed (video-taped) and manually counted cadence (steps/min) criterion cut points associated with markers of increasing intensity across age groupings. A secondary aim is to compare multiple instruments' abilities to accurately detect criterion values for cadence at different speeds and thus better inform our confidence in comparing this metric across instruments. To achieve these aims, cadence and oxygen uptake data will be collected during a treadmill assessment of incrementally faster paces and also using portable metabolic testing of common free- living activities to test the primary hypothesis: Activity intensity (oxygen uptake) will increase in a linear or nonlinear (curvilinear) fashion as cadence increases such that we will be able to develop statistical models for predicting markers (cut points) of intensity from cadence. We are uniquely positioned at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center to successfully conduct CADENCE-Adults as designed in a 5-year time period. We have conducted pilot testing demonstrating the feasibility of this project, established recruiting methods, and are fully experienced in exercise testing, accelerometry, and management of large complex data sets. We expect that cadence cut points established in CADENCE-Adults will be used both to assess ambulatory intensity, but also to inform program design focused on increasing not only the volume of physical activity (e.g., steps/day) but also its intensity (e.g., cadence) in user-friendly metrics. No similar data exist a this time so the approach described in this application is both innovative and critical to providin a minimally processed and translatable objectively monitored metric with established cut points across the lifespan."

With these areas as vanguards, it is important for COP to utilize emerging technologies for advanced learning opportunities for faculty, staff, and students and to create outreach opportunities for students and faculty to reach underrepresented and underserved communities for research and education. COP has the tenacity to excel in research, but will gain momentum with the utilization of the BRAD Award."
"9266702","OTHER PROJECT INFORMATION - Project Summary/Abstract Early Indicators, Intergenerational Processes, and Aging This program project is a competitive continuation of Early Indicators of Later Work Levels, Disease and Death. Since its inception in 1991, EI has made many discoveries about the longitudinal determinants of retirement and of chronic disease and death at older ages by studying aging processes among Union Army veterans of the US Civil War, a group that mostly reached age 65 between 1885 and 1912. Among these discoveries are  health at older ages, particularly for African-Americans, was worse than previously thought;  retirement responsiveness to income transfers was greater than expected;  social networks affected not just behavior but also health; and,  stressful events in early life and at young adult ages reduced longevity, but extreme stress after age 30 left  a more robust population. These discoveries were possible because of the creation of longitudinal data sets that follow more than 67,000 Union Army recruits from military service back to childhood and forward to death and contain about 15,000 observations per person. This competitive continuation will take the next step by examining the inter- generational determinants of later longevity and socioeconomic status. The overarching purpose of this continuation is to gain a more precise understanding of 1) how inter- generational processes affect aging and longevity and 2) the mechanisms through which parents transmit socioeconomic status and longevity to their children. Data collected for this continuation will support the research aims outlined in this proposal and will also be made publicly available. We propose two cores and three new scientific projects, which will create intergenerational databases from Early Indicators data: Project #1: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of White Americans Project #2: Intergenerational Processes and Aging of African-Americans Project #3: Intergenerational Processes and Aging in Multiple Generations Core A (Administrative) and B (Data Development) will support data collection, research, and dissemination."
"9329067","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT A long history of developmental biology research into avian and mammalian digit formation has defined the cellular and molecular underpinnings of the digit separation process. At a cellular level, apoptosis of the interdigital mesenchyme, as well as differential digit and interdigital growth, mediate digit separation. The interdigital apoptosis is initiated by decreasing FGF8 expression in the overlying epidermis which triggers a cascade of molecular changes in the interdigital mesenchyme, ultimately resulting in apoptosis and regression of the interdigital tissue. A failure of this process is thought to underlie a number of congenital abnormalities in humans with fused digits, a condition observed in 3-10 per 10 thousand births. Through our work on Grhl3-/- mice, we discovered an entirely new epithelial-based mechanism for digit separation. Our data suggest that while interdigital apoptosis is required for digit separation it is not sufficient. We identified the formation of a small multilayered epithelial tongue structure (referred to as the interdigital epithelial tongue; IET) proximally at the separating digit junctions. For normal digit formation, the epithelia within this structure needs to undergo bifurcation concomitant with the interdigital mesenchymal cell death. The hypotheses in this application are: 1) that as the interdigital juncture epithelium moves proximally and from the dorsal and ventral surfaces in response to interdigital mesenchyme cell death, a multilayered epithelial tongue structure forms at its leading edge; and 2) that a GRHL3-controlled pathway is required for bifurcation of the interdigital epithelial tongue to allow digit separation. We propose two Aims to test these hypotheses. In Aim 1, we will characterize the cellular mechanisms responsible for movement and bifurcation of the interdigital epithelial tongue. In Aim 2, we will define a GRHL3-regulated molecular pathway responsible for bifurcation of the interdigital epithelial tongue. These studies are significant and innovative because they define a previously unrecognized cellular and molecular pathway required for normal digit separation."
"9290942","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol Use Disorder affects nearly 20 million individuals in the United States and is a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality worldwide. Continuous, chronic alcohol abuse underlies the initiation and progression Alcoholic Liver Disease (ALD), attributable to 18,000 deaths in 2013 in the USA. ALD is a spectrum disorder encompassing steatosis, alcoholic hepatitis (AH), cirrhosis and even progressing to liver cancer. The pathogenesis of ALD in humans remains poorly understood and therapeutic options remain unchanged for decades. Despite this, data from human and animal studies demonstrate a robust role for the innate immune system in ALD. Recently, an emerging model of ethanol feeding in mice that resembles early AH in humans has been established. The Chronic/Binge (Gao-Binge or NIAAA model) model of ethanol feeding will establish mechanisms underlying several unknown features of AH, namely marked hepatocellular damage and infiltration of relevant immune cells, such as neutrophils. Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor (MIF), a regulator of innate immunity with chemokine- and cytokine-like activities, was previously identified as a key contributor to the early stage of ALD after chronic ethanol feeding to mice. With the advent of an acutely severe model of ethanol feeding, we sought to determine the role of MIF following Chronic/Binge ethanol feeding in mice. Much to our surprise, MIF-deficient mice had increased markers of hepatocellular damage, leukocyte infiltration, and increased inflammatory gene expression in the liver, suggesting that MIF is a hepatoprotective factor in AH. We therefore hypothesized that MIF protects from hepatocellular damage following Chronic/Binge feeding via MIF-mediated suppression of chemokine expression and subsequent leukocyte infiltration into the hepatic parenchyma. To interrogate the precise protective role(s) that MIF is playing in the Chronic/Binge model of ethanol feeding, we will perform loss-of-function and gain-of-function studies with MIF in mice to identify key changes in chemotactic factors, leukocyte infiltration and hepatocellular damage following Chronic/Binge ethanol feeding. Mechanistic studies guided by the results generated in animals will delineate specific, MIF-mediated molecular targets critical to acutely severe ethanol- induced liver injury. The proposed studies could provide rationale for novel therapeutic strategies to treat ALD in humans."
"9275334","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Helicobacter pylori infects the stomach of half of the world's population. This infection is a primary cause of peptic ulcer disease and a high risk factor for gastric cancer. Therefore, eradication of H. pylori infection leads to ulcer healing and lowers the risk of gastric cancer. Unil the discovery of H. pylori, it was thought that stomach acid presented an inhospitable environment for bacterial infection. However, H. pylori has uniquely developed the means of surviving and growing on the acidic surface of the human stomach, a process termed acid acclimation. Disruption of this process leads to loss of survival in acid; therefore, the components of this process would provide novel targets for eradication therapy. Current eradication therapies require the use of antibiotics along with acid-inhibitory drugs. The successful eradication by these therapies is decreasing because of increasing antibiotic resistance, resulting in a response rate of ~70% in the USA.  The growth-dependent antibiotics clarithromycin or amoxicillin are not effective unless bacteria are in growth phase. Improving acid inhibition should improve therapeutic outcome. In the first aim, we hypothesize that inhibition of acid secretion increases the number of bacteria in growth phase, making them sensitive to growth-dependent antibiotics, necessitating the requirement for administration of acid-inhibitory compounds, in addition to antibiotics for successful eradication. The finding that slow omeprazole metabolizers respond with much improved acid control and effective eradication with omeprazole and amoxicillin alone, suggests that improved acid inhibition increases the sensitivity of the organism to growth-dependent antibiotics.  From this it follows that, with more consistent and greater elevation of intragastric pH, more organisms are in the antibiotic-sensitive growth phase rather than the resistant stationary phase. Maintenance of an elevated pH for both day and night should put almost all H. pylori in growth phase. Therefore, the effect of profound acid inhibition on the bactericidal effect of amoxicillin will be tested in ivo in the gerbil.  UreI, a proton-gated urea channel, forms an inner membrane complex at least with urease and the Ni2+ insertion subunits. Formation of this complex and interaction of other proteins that comprise the complex will be identified using state-of-the-art MS/MS techniques. The novel crystal structure of UreI will be used to identify the cytoplasmic loop binding sites of the proteins interacting with the channel. In the future, the loops identified as essential can be exploited for the development of novel and specific inhibitors of UreI complex formation. Successful completion of this aim could lead to an H. pylori-specific mono-therapy for eradication."
"9328608","Skeletal muscle weakness is a known contributor to morbidity and mortality in aging and other diseases; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been well defined. It has recently been shown that disruption of circadian rhythms leads to significant weakness. Preliminary data from our lab shows that mice in which Bmal1, a core circadian gene, has been inducibly knocked-out in adult skeletal muscle (iMSBmal1-/-) express an increased amount of a longer spliceform of titin protein than their vehicle-treated counterparts (iMSBmal1+/+). These muscles also display increased variability in sarcomere length, decreases in specific tension, as well as diminished unstimulated baseline tension, a preliminary measure of passive tension. These data lead to my hypothesis that loss of Bmal1 expression in adult skeletal muscle will lead to 1) the increased inclusion of PEVK exons in titin that will contribute to sarcomere length variability and 2) changes in titin spliceform and sarcomere length will be associated with deficits in both the isometric length-tension relationship and elastic properties of this muscle. I will test my novel hypothesis through two aims. Specific Aim 1 will define the splicing changes in titin of iMSBmal1-/- skeletal muscle. RNA-Seq will be used to determine exon inclusion/exclusion in titin of iMSBmal1-/- and iMSBmal1+/+ tibialis anterior muscle. I will also test if changes to the length of the PEVK domain in titin protein account for the increased sarcomere length variability in iMSBmal1-/- skeletal muscle using immunohistochemical techniques combined with deconvoluted confocal microscopy. This aim will define the changes to a key sarcomeric protein, titin, following muscle-specific Bmal1 knockout and links this change to maintaining sarcomere length homogeneity. Specific Aim 2 tests if properties of titin-based skeletal muscle active and passive tension are diminished following Bmal1 knockout. I will perform in situ mechanical experiments to test both the isometric length-tension relationship of the muscle as well as the elasticity of the TA muscle without contractile contributions. I will then relate these measurements to the titin spliceform expressed within the muscle as well as immunohistochemical measurements (i.e., fiber cross-sectional area and fibrosis). These experiments will help determine the effects a loss of Bmal1 in skeletal muscle has on altered titin expression and sarcomere length maintenance with implications for the active length-tension relationship. The findings from this project hold potential to provide insight into a novel finding that the molecular clock helps to maintain skeletal muscle's structure and basic functional properties of the muscle through its control of titin spliceform expression."

"9242506","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Burkholderia cepacia complex are emerging as an important group of drug resistant pathogens. The increasing number of infections in immunocompromised patients raises significant concern as antibiotic development continues to lag and our understanding of this unique pathogen still remains undeveloped. Overcoming antibiotic resistance in this genetically highly complex organism possessing multiple chromosomes is a significant medical and scientific challenge. Our main objective is to identify novel ways of overcoming ß-lactamase-mediated resistance in these and other Gram-negative pathogens. Our previous studies investigating Pen-like ß-lactamases in Burkholderia spp. lead us to postulate that a novel diazabicyclooctane (DBO) ß-lactamase inhibitor, avibactam, possesses the correct chemical features to efficiently inactivate PenA. Based upon this chemistry, we will show why avibactam works while clavulanate, sulbactam and tazobactam do not. In addition, strong preliminary evidence we have obtained leads us to hypothesize that the altered regulation of ß-lactamases (i.e., blapen and blaampC,) by LysR-type transcriptional regulators (LTTRs) (i.e., PenRA and PenRB) in B. cepacia complex is a critical determinant in ß-lactam resistance. To address these hypotheses, we will use our knowledge of structure-function relationships of PenA ß-lactamase to understand the mechanism of inactivation by avibactam and we will employ new genetic and biochemical approaches to dissect the regulation of ß-lactamase-mediated resistance in B. cepacia complex focusing on the PenRA and PenRB. Studying the pathway to inactivation by avibactam will entail detailed biochemical and mechanistic analyses. Unravelling the complex regulation of PenA ß-lactamase expression in B. cepacia complex will require us to use the lessons learned from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter spp. to understand the steps needed. To address these objectives, the biochemical inhibitory parameters of avibactam will be determined against PenA focusing on key active site residues (i.e., S130, E166, N170, R220, T237, and E276) and obtain a crystal structure of avibactam in the active site of PenA. The in vitro activity  of the ceftazidime-avibactam will be assessed against diverse panel of clinical isolates of B. cepacia complex. Next, RNA-seq will be used to define the transcriptome of PenRA and PenRB. PenRA and PenRB from Burkholderia multivorans and Burkholderia cenocepacia, the two most clinically prevalent B. cepacia complex pathogens, will be cloned expressed, and purified. We will assess binding of transcription regulators to DNA and measure ß-lactamase induction. Finally, we will use site-directed mutagenesis to mutate positions 102, 103, 135, 221, and 264 of PenRA and PenRB and assess the impact of these changes on bla expression. We expect to show that this novel DBO inhibitor will inactivate PenA and that new mechanistic insights will be obtained against this carbapenemase as well as other difficult to inhibit ß-lactamases. We also anticipate that we will unravel the biochemical features of PenRA and PenRB that are necessary for the transcriptional regulation of bla expression in B. cepacia complex. Ultimately, our long term goal is to identify druggable sites on PenRA and PenRB. LTTRs may serve as a novel targets for therapies in Burkholderia spp. and other Gram-negatives. Achieving our objectives will impact the field by increasing the general understanding needed to identify novel antibiotic targets within problematic Gram-negatives."
"9218040","Age is the primary risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human studies that focus on the connections between transcriptomics and epigenomics of aging and their relationship to AD hold great promise for unraveling the molecular basis of AD and providing novel therapeutic targets. Transcriptomic and epigenomic studies reported to date have been hampered by a number of methodologic issues, especially the use of heterogeneous cell mixtures. Using transcriptomic profiles in purified monocytes from 1,263 participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA), we reported a transcriptional network of co-expressed oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes that decline with age. Our following transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that this OXPHOS network of 21 genes (FDRs<0.05) were positively associated with cognitive function. These human data, combined with our non-human primate data correlating mitochondrial function of monocytes and frontal cortex tissue and recent data in transgenic mice showing a causal role of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, suggest that monocyte transcriptional profiles may reflect brain bioenergetic dysfunctions linking age to AD. Given emerging evidence in mice that monocytes can infiltrate the brain and take over immune surveillance, our data also suggest that altered monocyte function may affect AD. Nevertheless, our cross- sectional human data cannot determine whether genomic alteration of OXPHOS is a cause or consequence of AD. The goal of the proposed study is to determine the impact of cell specific gene networks, especially aging- related networks such as OXPHOS, on the development of AD through an integrated analysis of genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic data in a longitudinal community-based study. The deeply phenotyped MESA cohort, with unique existing epigenomic, transcriptomic and cognitive data collected at Exam 5 (2010-11), offers an ideal study population. We propose to repeat the epigenomic, transcriptomic and cognitive assessment at Exam 6 (2016-17) and perform the cognitive battery of the Uniform Data Set to enable ascertainment of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's dementia at Exam 6 and three years later in a subset of MESA cohort (N=1,200) to achieve the following specific aims: 1) To determine whether aging- related changes in transcriptomic/epigenomic profiles predict cognitive decline over a 6-year follow-up; 2) To determine whether aging-related changes in transcriptomic/epigenomic profiles predict development of AD over a three-year follow-up; and 3) To determine whether differences in mitochondrial activity and content, which would be predicted from the OXPHOS alterations, relate to development of AD. This large, prospective multi-omic study will take a novel approach of focusing on aging-related gene networks in human homogeneous cells to identify new biomarkers for AD development, a crucial step forward in understanding cell-specific mechanisms and providing clues to early intervention."
"9250130","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Articular cartilage lines the surfaces of joints and transmits the forces generated with loading. Due to limitations in the natural healing capacity of cartilage, and given the increasing incidence of osteoarthritis, there exists a growing demand for cell-based strategies for repair. Tissue engineering, and particularly those approaches based on autologous mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), is evolving as a clinically relevant technique to promote cartilage regeneration. Yet, the formed tissue properties as well as the stability of phenotype and heterogeneous cellular response within constructs are concerns that currently limit translation of this technology. Our general approach to MSC-based cartilage repair addresses the differences observed between early rapid stages of cartilage formation and the gradual remodeling (maturation) that results in a tissue capable of adult function. This transformative process is driven by a multitude of temporal factors (chemical, mechanical, and soluble). Our progress during the ongoing grant has shown a role for matrix and cellular density, the timing of material degradation, introduction of soluble inductive factors, and mechanical loading (both compression and sliding contact) in guiding cartilage formation and maturation. Here, we build from these studies by introducing a developmentally relevant signal, namely cell-cell interactions through N-cadherin that are found during limb bud development, into our engineered hydrogel systems. In the first Aim, MSCs will be encapsulated in HA hydrogels modified with peptides that mimic the extracellular domain of N-cadherin, and the influence of peptide density on chondrogenesis and cartilage maturation will be investigated, in addition to the influence of the peptide on population heterogeneity and phenotypic stability. In the second Aim, the temporal presentation of the peptides will be investigated by introducing linkers that undergo cell-mediated proteolysis of the peptides from the HA hydrogels. The influence of the temporal peptide presentation on chondrogenesis, cartilage maturation, population heterogeneity, and phenotypic stability will be assessed as in the first Aim, in addition to the responsiveness to mechanical loading based on the acceleration of chondrogenesis. In the third Aim, N-cadherin peptide modified hydrogels, including both stable and transient presentation, will be investigated in a clinically-relevant load-bearing porcine defect model to assess the role of these interactions in an implanted hydrogel in cartilage defect repair. These Aims were designed to allow the testing of our hypotheses that control over the MSC microenvironment, and inclusion of signals present during normal development that are both permissive and instructive for cartilage formation and maturation, will lead to the generation of constructs with properties akin to native tissue and improved repair."
"9383719","Project summary. T lymphocytes are cells of the immune system that, like all blood cells, are routinely lost throughout life and must be replenished. The thymus is the primary site for T lymphocyte production. However, it contains no lymphoid stem cells, and instead depends on continuous importation of stem-like cells that circulate in the blood. Microenvironmental conditions unique to the thymus then instruct these stem-like cells to proliferate and differentiate into T lineage cells that recognize foreign substances but are tolerant to self. The durable thymic microenvironment is established by its stromal cells, consisting primarily of epithelial cells (thymic epithelial cells, TEC). TEC form a pervasive reticular matrix (network) upon which lymphocyte development depends, and competition for the TEC network limits lymphoid cellularity in the thymus, and thus T cell output. For reasons that are still not understood, the thymus exhibits premature and accelerated age-related atrophy, a disorder that is primarily a consequence of changes in TEC. Importantly, the thymus retains latent potential for short-lived regeneration, which can be induced by stimuli such as surgical castration. The mechanisms of this process are not well known, but are believed to require proliferation of TEC cells themselves, or expansion of a TEC precursor population. We have generated a large temporo-spatial database of global stromal gene transcription during induced regrowth. Multiple independent data mining approaches have consistently indicated that genes associated with projection, extension, and outgrowth of cellular processes, such as those that characterize the TEC network, are dynamically regulated during regeneration. To begin to evaluate the role of TEC projections in lymphoid development, thymic aging, and thymic regeneration, we have adopted contemporary neuroscience imaging technologies (Rosa26[Brainbow 2.1], a.k.a. Confetti) in thick organ slices to visualize individual TEC and the TEC network. We find that the morphology of individual TEC, particularly those in the cortex (cTEC), is vastly different than what is suggested by conventional immuno-staining of thin sections, with overall globular rather than radially aligned reticular shapes, each possessing elaborate processes that envelop large numbers of lymphocytes. In the `aged' thymus (from 6 month-old Confetti mice), these processes become both shorter and thinner, and thus provide a diminished surface for lymphoid contact that explains reduced cellularity with age. We predict that rather than TEC proliferation, surgical castration will induce the (transient) lengthening and strengthening of these processes, thus increasing lymphocyte production. Testing this hypothesis is a key objective in this project, but in order to accomplish this, we are first obligated to establish a baseline in the healthy state for TEC and the TEC network. The proposed project relies heavily on established and emerging neuroscience paradigms, and is consistent with the stated mission of the NIH to ?to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems, and the application of that knowledge to enhance health?and reduce illness.?"
"9276255","PROJECT SUMMARY  Barrett's esophagus (BE) and esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) are complex diseases with undiscovered  genetic factors. We successfully discovered a deleterious variant in VSIG10L segregating in a large family. This  is the first such reported gene for susceptibility to BE and EAC. VSIG10L appears to function in adhesion and  differentiation/maturation of stratified squamous epithelium. Further clues for a genetic basis comes from our  admixture mapping study, which has identified two specific chromosomal regions associated with excess  European ancestry in African Americans. The BETRNet focus of Project 1 is thus to identify the genetic basis of  racial disparity in the prevalence of BE and EAC. A second BETRNet focus of Project 1 is to create a genetically  engineered mouse model based on VSIG10L to understand the transformation from squamous epithelium to  metaplastic Barrett's epithelium. This project will now build on these discoveries by:   1) Using dense SNP genotyping, NextGen sequencing, and ATAC-seq to identify racially disparate genetic   variants that explain racial differences in prevalence of BE and EAC;   2) Using genetically engineered VSIG10L knockout and VSIG10L S631G variant carrying mice to   understand how VSIG10L contributes to the normal squamous epithelium ? esophagitis ? BE   metaplasia ? dysplasia ? cancer progression;  The significance of Project 1 is first to translate the clinical observation of racial disparity in BE and EAC into the  laboratory to identify a causative genetic basis. Furthermore, the project will build on our successful discovery of  the first familial susceptibility genetic variant by understanding how this gene functions in metaplastic  transformation of Barrett's epithelium."
"9275424","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):    Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb), is a global health problem. Treatment of drug-susceptible TB involves months of therapy with multiple potentially toxic antibiotics. Treatment of TB has become even more difficult by the emergence and increasing prevalence of multi-drug resistant M.tb. This proposal focuses on the development of a novel therapy that targets M.tb iron (Fe) acquisition, a process that is critical to its ability to cause  disease. Ga(NO3)3 is a FDA- approved drug for treating hypercalcemia of malignancy. It interferes with cellular Fe metabolism by competing with Fe for uptake/use. We find that Ga also decreases M.tb Fe acquisition, inhibits growth of both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant M.tb strains growing in vitro extracellularly and within human macrophages. Ga also demonstrated efficacy in murine models of M.tb infection. Intermittent systemic delivery of Ga(NO3)3 for a few days has shown minimal toxicity in humans. However, treatment of TB would likely require more sustained treatment regimens. Ways to improve targeting of Ga to infected macrophages, extend dosing intervals, or avoid systemic administration would improve Ga's therapeutic index. There have been considerable advances in recent years in the aerosol delivery of drugs to the lung, as well as cellular targeting of nanoparticles to accomplish these goals. Therefore, we hypothesize that Ga delivery by aerosol or nanoparticle to the lung could prove to be novel, well-tolerated, and effective therapies for TB that would work via disruption of M.tb Fe metabolism. In order to test the above hypothesis we propose to accomplish the following specific aims: 1. Identify forms of Ga that exhibit maximal in vitro potency against extracellular and intracellular M.tb, including MDR- and XDR-TB, with the goal of arriving at lead compounds. 2. Develop formulations of two lead Ga compounds that will allow them to be administered by inhalation for the treatment of pulmonary TB and determine their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy in murine models of pulmonary TB. 3. Develop nanoparticle formulations of two lead Ga compounds that will allow them to be administered for the treatment of pulmonary TB and determine their biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity and efficacy in murine models of pulmonary TB. 4. Determine mechanisms of action of the lead Ga formulations against M.tb, potential for emergence of resistance, and effect of the presence of other TB drugs on Ga anti-mycobacterial activity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODOLOGY: Human monocyte-derived macrophages and murine models of TB will be employed along with fully virulent strains of M.tb. The work will emphasize: Fe and Ga acquisition by M.tb: Ga biodistribution, pharmacokinetics, toxicity; and potential bacterial target for Ga antimicrobial activity. Experimental methods employed include: development of Ga formulations suitable for aerosol or nanoparticle-mediated delivery; bacterial uptake of radiolabeled Fe and Ga, growth of M.tb in vitro and in vivo, murine models of pulmonary TB, quantitation of Ga in tissues. POTENTIAL IMPACT ON VETERAN HEALTH CARE: Veterans are at high risk for pulmonary TB. This work could lead to development of novel treatments for TB that would benefit veterans."
"9275307","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         A decline in estrogen levels, such as occurs at the menopause, causes bone loss by increasing the number of bone resorbing osteoclasts. The mechanisms by which estrogen controls osteoclast number are only partially understood, but previous studies suggest that lymphocytes play an important role. For example, ovariectomy of mice or rats consistently leads to increased numbers of B lymphocytes in the bone marrow. This increase in B cell number has been suggested to contribute to increased osteoclast formation by different mechanisms, such as B cell production of the osteoclastogenic cytokine receptor activator of NF-kappa-B ligand (RANKL) and differentiation of B cell precursors into osteoclasts. However, until recently, there was no functional evidence that B cells play an essential role in ovariectomy-induced bone loss. In studies leading to this application, we have found that production of the cytokine receptor activator of NF-kappa-B ligand (RANKL) by B lymphocytes is essential for the cancellous bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency in mice. Importantly, RANKL is also required for the increase in B cell number that is caused by estrogen deficiency. Also, ovariectomy did not increase the levels of RANKL in B cells in wild type mice. Together, these results suggest that it is the increase in B cell number that is required for ovariectomy-induced bone loss in this model. It is also important to note that deletion of RANKL from B cells did not prevent loss of cortical bone caused by estrogen deficiency. Therefore, RANKL produced by cell types other than B cells must be involved in the osteoclast formation in this skeletal compartment. Based on these results, we hypothesize that loss of estrogen causes cancellous bone loss, in part, by increasing the number of B cells, which can then act as osteoclast progenitors. Further, we propose that loss of estrogen causes cortical bone loss by altering production of RANKL by cells of the osteoblast lineage. To address these hypotheses, lineage-tracing studies will be performed to determine whether B cells, at any stage of their development, can differentiate into bone resorbing osteoclasts in vivo. In addition, whether estrogen suppresses B cell number by acting directly on these cells will be determined by conditional deletion of estrogen receptor alpha from this cell type. Lastly, mice in which the RANKL gene has been deleted from either osteocytes or from stromal cells of the osteoblast lineage will be ovariectomized to determine whether RANKL produced by these cell types contributes to the cortical bone loss caused by estrogen deficiency."
"9275327","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonists such as morphine, fentanyl and remifentanil (remi) are the most effective perioperative analgesics for both acute severe postoperative pain and chronic severe pain states. The most serious, life-threatening side effect, which limits their dosage, is profound depression of breathing rate (bradypnea) and tidal volume. This risk is increased in the presence of other sedatives such as benzodiazepines (BZDs) and alcohol. Our studies indicate that neurons in the parabrachial/ K?lliker-Fuse nuclei (PB-KF complex) of the pons are very sensitive to low clinical opioid concentrations associated with bradypnea and have the potential to cause respiratory arrest. We have also discovered that neurons in a small parabrachial subregion (PBSR) control breathing frequency (fB) and appear to be the portal that mediates the opioid-induced bradypnea. Localized excitation of PBSR neurons increase fB, while those that decrease neuronal activity decrease fB even to the point of apnea. Thus, any drugs that affect the activity of PBSR neurons will have a major impact on breathing. Our working hypothesis is the PBSR functions as the major controller of fB by providing excitatory inputs to the rhythmogenic preB?tzinger Complex (preBC) that produces phasic inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) neuronal discharge patterns. Depression of PBSR neuronal activity by systemically administered opioids alone or combined with sedatives leads to severe bradypnea or arrest. The PBSR also modulates the gain of the reflex control of I-duration (TI) and E-duration (TE) mediated by slowly adapting pulmonary stretch receptors (PSRs). To address the above hypotheses, the following specific aims will be pursued: 1) Precisely locate the PBSR in the dorsal pons near the PB-KF area that controls eupneic fB as suggested by preliminary findings, 2) Identify the PBSR neuron subtypes, determine if their axons project to the preBC/BC region and quantify their responses to PSR inputs, 3) determine how the discharge patterns of the various PBSR neuron subtypes are generated and controlled by A) NMDA and nonNMDA receptor mediated glutamatergic endogenous excitation and B) by GABAergic and glycinergic endogenous inhibition, 4) determine A) whether the GABAA receptors on neurons within this region are modulated by BZDs (e.g., midazolam), B) whether systemically-administered BZDs act on neurons within the PBSR (antagonized by microinjected flumazenil), and C) whether microinjected BZDs modulate the effects of iv remifentanil-induced    bradypnea, 5) determine the role of GABAB receptors in the modulation of PBSR neurons and of TI and TE via microinjections of selective agonists and antagonists, 6) identify preBC neuron subtypes that mediate increases in fB evoked within the PBSR by AMPA stimulation and highly localized electrical stimuli, and 7 A) characterize the modulation of the PSR reflex control of TI and TE mediated by the PBSR, and B) and determine whether this modulation is due to PBSR inputs to the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) that alter the PSR neurotransmission to the second order neurons. Systemic i.v. infusions of ultra short-acting remifentanil will be used to produce bradypnea in an in vivo decerebrate canine model. Phrenic nerve activity will be recorded to measure TI and TE. Multibarrel micropipettes and a 16-electrode probe (NeuroNexus) will be used to simultaneously record the discharge of PBSR neurons while picoejecting neuroactive agents. Responses to PSR inputs and axon projections to the preBC region will be used to further classify the PBSR neurons. The PBSR appears to act as the portal through which breathing rate is controlled. Thus, the study of the neurophysiological and neuropharmacological characteristics of this discrete region will provide major insight into the mechanisms by which drugs adversely affect breathing frequency and suggest therapeutic measures to alleviate undesirable side effects. These studies will also provide important new information on the functional roles of PBSR neurons and the contribution of specific neurotransmitters/modulators to the discharge patterns of PBSR neuron subtypes in vivo and new insights into control of breathing mechanisms."
"9270426","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Preschool-aged foster children are at high risk for numerous negative outcomes, and these risks are heightened for children who experience foster placement disruptions. However, there is very limited use of evidence-based interventions for young children in the child welfare system. Major barriers to progress in this area include a lack of available evidence-based programs for foster children across the preschool years and the tendency for the few existing evidence-based interventions to be resource intensive in terms of funding and the level of staff expertise required to be implemented with fidelity. Readily scalable, evidence-based interventions for foster preschoolers are clearly needed to reduce the widespread disparities. The goal of the proposed study is to conduct a randomized clinical trial of a new, low-cost, manualized, group-based intervention for foster preschoolers and their caregivers. We propose to evaluate two versions of the intervention: (a) a basic version that employs a curriculum consisting of 16 weekly psychoeducational foster/kinship caregiver support groups and (b) an augmented version that consists of the caregiver support groups and 16 weekly, curriculum-based, child playgroups targeting executive functioning, early literacy, and socioemotional development. Across four waves of data collection (baseline, immediately post intervention, and 12 and 18 months post baseline), we will examine the extent to which the two intervention conditions show improved parenting, reduced rates of disrupted placements, and improved child outcomes. We will conduct multivariate modeling to examine mediating mechanisms underlying the hypothesized immediate and longer- term intervention effects. Finally, we will conduct a comprehensive economic evaluation to examine the incremental costs associated with implementing each intervention condition (compared to services as usual) and the benefits realized in the intervention conditions in terms of increased positive outcomes for children."
"9220700","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Candida albicans is the predominant species of human fungal infections and a common colonizer of the oral cavity in healthy adults, yet pathogenic overgrowth can occur when host immunity is altered due to severe illness or immunosuppression. Recent studies from our group have established a critical role for the pro- inflammatory cytokine IL-1? in protection from oral infection in a model of mucosal candidiasis. The synthesis, processing and release of IL-1? is tightly regulated and require at least two distinct stimuli; first, an inflammatory stimulus mediatd by innate pattern recognition receptors such as TLR2 or dectin-1 causes accumulation of large intracellular stores of pro-IL-1?. A second signal is required for activation of a multi- protein complex, the inflammasome, leading to the activation of caspase-1 and cleavage of pro-IL-1? to the active mature form. We have previously shown that the NLRP3 inflammasome is crucial for protection against Candida infection. New data from our laboratory show that, in addition to the NLRP3 molecule, another inflammasome protein, NLRC4, is up-regulated in oral mucosal tissues following Candida infection. In the absence of NLRC4, mucosal infection is enhanced. We also showed that the role of NLRC4 in anti-fungal defense is tissue specific, playing a more important role in the mucosa than in inflammatory cells, where the NLRP3 inflammasome is activated. In this proposal, we aim to further interrogate the role of different inflammasomes in mucosal immune responses to fungal infection, investigating the impact of NLRP3 versus NLRC4 activation on other important innate epithelial immune responses, the recruitment inflammatory cells, and the development of downstream adaptive immunity to Candida. Additionally, we aim to determine the molecular mechanism including the role of different fungal cell wall components in inflammasome activation in response to Candida. Due to increasing resistance to antifungal drugs, the development of novel therapeutic strategies designed to prevent or enhance clearance of fungal infection is a priority. This project will advance that goal through detailed characterization of the role of the NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasomes in host defense to mucosal candidiasis."
"9266294","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT?ASTHMA AND ALLERGIC DISEASES GROUP   Through this Funding Opportunity Announcement, the NIAID Division of Allergy, Immunology and  Transplantation (DAIT) intends to consolidate its funding for multiple, independent Statistical and Clinical  Coordinating Centers (SACCCs) into a single multi-component cooperative agreement, presumably to reduce  costs and increase efficiency and standardization across research consortia. This new program will fund a  single SACCC or Center to support DAIT research in the areas of asthma and allergic diseases, autoimmune  diseases, and transplantation, and in the area of asthma and allergic diseases research, this Center will  provide support to 5 consortia?the Asthma and Allergic Diseases Cooperative Research Centers (AADCRCs),  the Atopic Dermatitis Research Network (ADRN), the Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR), the  Inner-City Asthma Consortium (ICAC), and the asthma and allergy component of Immune Tolerance Network  (ITN). Within the Center, support for these 5 consortia will be organized under 1 group?the Asthma and  Allergy Diseases Group (AADG). The objective of the AADG is to provide excellent and efficient study  coordination support services across the 5 asthma and allergic diseases research consortia. To accomplish  this objective, RhoFED aims to (1) provide staff experienced in asthma and allergic disease research  conducted by DAIT-supported consortia and to organize these staff in an administrative structure that manages  resources efficiently, is responsive to the needs of the research consortia and DAIT, and facilitates  communication and collaboration; (2) provide experienced scientists and statisticians who, in collaboration with  clinical investigators and senior DAIT officials, design and analyze studies across the full scope of research in  asthma and allergic diseases; (3) facilitate the development, review, and revision of initial and successive  drafts of protocols and protocol-related documents through dedicated AADG protocol teams; and (4) provide  study initiation and study management functions that are required for the efficient, valid, and ethical conduct of  studies. In addition, the AADG will support the continuation of the ADRN Subject Registry and the ICAC  Clinical Specimen Repository. Because RhoFED is currently the SACCC for ADRN, ICAC, and ITN and  maintains the ADRN Subject Registry and the ICAC Clinical Specimen Repository, RhoFED is well suited to  provide consolidated SACCC support across the 5 consortia. And, by providing staff with experience in  supporting asthma and allergic disease research consortia and an administrative infrastructure designed to  enhance collaboration between parties and support agile and effective resource management, we believe that  support of these 5 consortia through the newly formed Center and the AADG will directly contribute to the  achievement of the DAIT objective to better understand, treat, and prevent asthma and allergic diseases."
"9272771","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The genetics of Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) is advancing at rapid pace. An increasing number of risk- associated polymorphisms and variants are found in intergenic, intronic and other non-coding sequence. However, it has been a major challenge to design testable hypotheses to elucidate the potential function of such types of disease-associated non-coding DNA. Many of these sequences are thought to exert regulatory functions, including longe range enhancer elements physically interacting with transcription start sites (TSS) separated on the linear genome by many kilobases of interspersed DNA. We will first generate a comprehensive annotation map of open chromatin and enhancer sequences in tissue and cellular populations (neurons, astrocytes and microglia) that are relevant to the pathophysiology of AD. We will then leverage high resolution expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) maps from two large, multiregional RNAseq projects in brain tissue and identify AD associated noncoding regions that are positioned within regulatory regions tagged with combinatorial histone modification signatures indicative of active enhancers and statistical (eQTL) evidence for long range TSS interactions. We then will employ innovative approaches in neuroepigenetics, including chromosome conformation capture (3C) to map long range enhancer-promoter interactions in human brain postmortem tissue. The multidimensional approach presented here provides a roadmap to unravel the neurological functions of the vast but in brain largely unexplored non-coding sequences of the human genome."
"9272410","I. Introduction and Progress: A major goal of the ND INBRE in the current funding cycle was to establish bioinformatics expertise to serve the ND INBRE partners. In the early funding cycles of BRIN and INBRE, the ND INBRE bioinformatics program focused on the introduction and improvement of the electronic library resources that would be necessary to serve biomedical research in ND. At this early juncture in the program, there was both limited internet access and electronic library resources in ND. As detailed in the previous competing renewal, this goal was successfully accomplished by ND INBRE and all INBRE partners now have electronic access to the UNO Library system. Due to these advances, a major goal of the ND INBRE in the current grant cycle was to establish the foundation for the development of bioinformatics in ND through recruitment and development of bioinformatics faculty. In the current funding cycle, the ND INBRE challenged both Research Intensive Universities in ND to participate with the ND INBRE to develop a Bioinformatics Core to serve the educational and research needs of our partners throughout the state. As part of this challenge, the ND INBRE committed $125,000 a year to each RIU to assist each in joining the ND INBRE in this important endeavor of infrastructure building and a central goal of the IDeA program.  The Dean of the SMHS took full advantage of this opportunity. Foremost, Dr. Wynne provided a state? supported FTE for the initial recruitment of the first bioinformatics faculty member at the UNO SMHS. This allowed ND INBRE funds committed to this appointment to be used to support the development of the faculty member and the Bioinformatics Core facility. The UNO SMHS successfully recruited Dr. Ke Zhang into the Department of Pathology to supervise the ND INBRE Bioinformatics Core. Dr. Zhang and ND INBRE initially equipped the facility with a Dell PowerEdge R910 4U rack server that has four Intel Xeon X7550 CPUs and 512 GB RAM. This R910 server allows parallel computation of 64 processes simultaneously. To date, this server has enabled the core to fulfill most of the required tasks for bioinformatics research and education. The R910 is a single-node server and a major advantage of R910 is that it has a large shared memory (500 GB) that allows development of computational algorithms with a large data structure. This Dell R910 server is valuable and will remain a valuable part of the Bioinformatics Core. The R910 server will continue to be used for methodology development and student training.  Due to the success of the ND INBRE Bioinformatics Core, this server was becoming a limiting factor for meeting the computational requirements for the fast-growing area of genomic data-sets. As a result, the ND INBRE in early 2013, in combination with other internal resources of the PI at the UNO SMHS, purchased a cluster server in order to meet the computational challenges in the Bioinformatics Core. The cluster server will be used for computationally intensive tasks such as processing next generation sequencing data. The Summary Configuration of the cluster server is: 16 Compute Nodes, 2 Intel MIC chips, Gigabit Networking, and Rack with Power Distribution. Additional information on specifics is available below and on the ND INBRE website under Bioinformatics. The support of a major portion of Dr. Zhang's salary by the Dean of the SMHS also allowed important ND INBRE resources to be re-deployed to support the research and core duties of Dr. Zhang. These resources were used by Dr. Zhang to employ on average 3 computer science undergraduates and 2 computer science graduate students to support core function. In addition to employment, many students are pursuing research projects with Dr. Zhang. The SMHS and the Department of Pathology have provided Dr. Zhang 450 sq. ft. of space to support his undergraduate and graduate personnel. Each student has independent desk space that is equipped with a Dell computer and required software. The impact of this support is effectively illustrated by the numerous publications and presentations produced by Dr. Zhang since his arrival at UNO SMHS. These resources also supported his scholarly activity and service requirements necessary to compete effectively on the academic tenure track. Dr. Zhang is also a participant on a new R01 award in excess of $1.2 million.  As detailed in the progress report, UNO SMHS institutional support to the Bioinformatics Core by Dr. Wynne, the Dean of the SMHS and Vice President for Health Affairs, will exceed $900,000 over the current 5year funding cycle. This is a return of over 100% of the direct investment of funds by the ND INBRE."
"9281538","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Stroke (focal cerebral ischemia) is a leading cause of death and disability in aging Veterans. Furthermore, many aged Veterans also suffer from neurodegenerative disorders. The mechanisms that contribute to secondary brain damage and neurological dysfunction after stroke are not completely understood. Preliminary studies of this proposal show induction of a-Synuclein expression in the brains of rodents subjected to focal ischemia. As a-Synuclein is thought to be a major contributor of neuronal death in Parkinson Disease and other chronic neurodegenerative diseases, the present proposal will test the hypothesis a-Synuclein is a contributor of post-stroke brain damage. This hypothesis will be tested by the following Specific Aims:  Aim 1 is to evaluate the functional significance of a-Synuclein in promoting secondary brain damage and neurological dysfunction following experimental stroke using a-Synuclein siRNA-mediated knockdown and a-Synuclein knockout mice as alternate approaches.  Aim 2 is to evaluate if down-regulation of microRNA miR-7a is responsible for a-Synuclein protein induction in the post-ischemic brain. We will test if restoring miR-7a levels with a miR mimic curtails a- synuclein mediated post-ischemic secondary brain damage and neurological dysfunction.  Aim 3 is to identify if a-Synuclein induced after stroke mediates secondary brain damage by modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, apoptosis, mitochondrial fission, and autophagy. We will test if a- Synuclein knockdown curtails these post-ischemic pathophysiological mechanisms and thus decreases post-ischemic brain damage.  Aim 4 is to test the role of post-translational modifications of a-Synuclein in ischemic brain damage. We will specifically study ser-129 phosphorylation which is thought to promote a-Synuclein oligomerization and toxicity and lysine ubiquitination which is thought to be important for a-Synuclein degradation by lysosomes.  Aim 5 is to study the long-term implications of a-Synuclein induction after stroke. This is important as a- Synuclein accumulation and toxicity occur over decades in chronic neurodegenerative conditions; whereas a-Synuclein increases rapidly within hours after stroke. Overall, the present project will serve as a bridge to understan the role of a-Synuclein and to design novel therapies based on a-Synuclein and miRNA-7a to minimize the post-stroke brain damage in Veterans. Relevance of the proposed work to the VA patient care mission: Every year, >7,000 Veterans suffer new strokes and there are >80,000 surviving Veterans with stroke-induced neurological dysfunction. The negative impact of this devastating disease on Veterans increases enormously in the near future unless the molecular mechanisms of post-stroke brain damage are deciphered and therapies are developed based on the new targets. a-Synuclein is an attractive target to curtail post-stroke brain damage as many resources are already available from the ongoing research on Parkinson Disease. Successful completion of the proposed studies to evaluate the significance of a-Synuclein after stroke helps the recovery of surviving stroke sufferers among Veterans."
"9275305","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         PROJECT SUMMARY This project proposes to study hypothermia as a treatment of refractory status epilepticus (RSE). RSE is an increasingly common problem in VA Intensive Care Units. This may be due to improvement in life support systems and ICU technology, to increased availability of EEG recordings and increased recognition of subtle status epilepticus (SE) and other factors. The results of treatment of RSE are very poor, with high mortality and morbidity. New treatments are needed. Deep hypothermia (200 C) is used clinically during cardiac surgery and neurosurgery. Moderate hypothermia (32-330 C) is used routinely in the treatment of neonatal hypoxic- ischemic encephalopathy, of post-cardiac arrest encephalopathy and of traumatic brain injury. Hypothermia has proved safe and effective in those conditions. It has also been shown to inhibit seizure activity. Yet, it is rarely used to treat RSE, and we lack a basic understanding of its indications and effectiveness in RSE. We will test the hypothesis that deep hypothermia reduces seizure activity in two models of experimental status epilepticus induced respectively by chemical (lithium and pilocarpine) or by electrical (perforant path) stimulation of the brain. We will compare deep and mild hypothermia, and will test different durations of mild hypothermia, to find out whether longer durations of mild hypothermia can be as effective in terminating RSE as short durations of deep hypothermia. We will compare two methods for delivering hypothermia: whole body cooling and head cooling (cool cap). For the same level of cooling of parietal cortex, we expect whole body cooling is more effective than the cool cap method in terminating SE. Finally, we will study the effect of hypothermia treatment on the long-term consequences of RSE: neuronal injury, blood-brain barrier breakdown, cell-mediated inflammation, epileptogenesis and behavioral deficits. We expect hypothermia treatment to reduce all of these complications. At the end of this study, we expect to be able to define the depth, duration and method of hypothermia that is most effective in the treatment of experimental status epilepticus."
"9265725","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every day we make important health decisions ranging from what we choose to eat to how physically active we choose to be. Such decisions have a dramatic impact on broad health outcomes, especially as we age. For instance, in light of evidence documenting decreased physical activity with advanced age, how can the health promotion decisions of older adults be influenced? Although traditional conceptualizations of decision making have focused heavily on the cognitive, deliberative aspects of decision making, recent perspectives have emphasized the role of emotion in decision making, which may become more prominent in later life. Although older adults experience declines in deliberative psychological processes critical to decision making, they show stability in emotional processes and also show a preference for positive over negative material. These divergent age-related trajectories may then impact how older adults make health-related decisions. In the health domain, one specific way in which behaviors such as exercise are impacted is through message framing. In particular, loss-framed messages that emphasize the negative consequences of not engaging in a behavior are particularly persuasive for behaviors involving risk (e.g., detecting an illness). In contrast, gain-framed messages that emphasize the benefits of engaging in a behavior are particularly effective for promoting preventative behaviors (e.g., exercise). The proposed research will examine the underlying affective and cognitive mechanisms of message framing as applied to exercise in older and younger adults as well as how such messages may influence actual physical activity. Specifically, this research will: (1) explicate how emotional ad cognitive processes underlie age differences in the processing of framed health-related messages, and (2) examine how message framing impacts the exercise engagement, adherence, and maintenance of older adults. These aims will be met first through two laboratory experiments that examine the effects of gain- versus loss-framed messages on the affective reactions, attitudes, and behavioral intentions of older and younger adults. In addition, three intervention studies will examine how such message framing impacts the behavior of older adults with respect to an evidence-based fitness program with documented success in improving health and wellbeing, Fit & Strong!. By pursuing these aims, this project promises: to increase our understanding of the role of cognitive and emotional processes in decision making across the adult life span; to better inform prescriptive recommendations for how to best frame certain health messages; and to illustrate the effectiveness of message framing on enhancing the physical activity, health, and cognitive vitality of older adults through a health intervention"
"9481881","Our leadership spans the translational spectrum - clinical (Chute, Robinson, Koeller, Hamosh), biological (Haendel, Hoatlin, Doheny), and computational (Mungall, Su, Liu, McWeeney, Overby), with expertise in a wide variety of data sources, types, and models as well as data integration strategies, standards, and algorithms. We are invested in open science, reproducibility, and lead efforts in developing open software, data standards, and crowdsourcing curation platforms. Our vision is to demonstrate connectivity between rare disease and common diseases via genes, pathways, and pathophysiology. We will include disease-phenotype associations, enriched with temporal information and decomposed into biological units. Innovative integration of mechanism and function will allow creation of candidate mechanistic graphs for each rare disease. We will use graph matching and probabilistic techniques to support basic research hypothesis testing as well as clinical inquiry (diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment selection). Finally, our team is deeply committed to enabling the collective use of all public biomedical data by making it interoperable and openly accessible for all users, in all contexts. Semantics matter to integration. The figure highlights the landscape of existing data resources, each contain a portion of data with specific, relevant meaning (A). Aggregation alone often results in loss of meaning (B). Semantic and probabilistic integration approaches provision for more advanced query answering capabilities (C). We have first hand experience overcoming challenges found within large-scale integration projects in general, but more important, we are very familiar with data sources and types this proposal aims to integrate. For example, knockdown of TP53 in zebrafish is used to reduce apoptosis; naive use of the data might attribute phenotypic effects to targeted genes. Other issues are in knowing when and how to integrate data where the associations between entities are not equivalent, such as when one source annotates a disease to a gene and another to a variant. Our existing infrastructure has successfully integrated and leveraged multimodal data for rare disease diagnosis. Here we extend these systems with new data types and new methodologies that generalize across diseases and contexts. The TransMed Knowledge Graph will have an intelligent, adaptive scaffolding for managing and linking the phenomenological worldview of clinical elements with the mechanistic emphases of basic science. Connections between biological entities and events will be represented either directly, or through chaining, enabling the use of powerful algorithms for query and inference. Elements in the graph will be stratified by either classical, rigid taxonomies (disease nosologies, tissue and cell type) or through dynamic groups based on shared mechanisms of molecular pathophysiology. External data can be compared using different criteria. For instance, two patients (one rare disease, one common disease) may be distant in classical nosology, but neighbors in pathway space - suggesting a treatment. The graph will be seeded from open data sources containing diverse data types, supplemented by knowledge from the literature and clinical data. TransMed will also be readily connected to other data stores using a quality identifier strategy, methods that predict probability of equivalency from associated metadata, and algorithms that match graphs based on similar members. Summary. Familiarity with the data, combined with our technical experience, and connection to real-world use cases positions us well to be both relevant and successful in our vision."
"9330756","Aging is the major risk factor for Alzheimer?s disease (AD), leading to cellular and functional changes within the brain that culminate in dementia and cognitive decline. Lessening or reversing brain aging may delay Alzheimer?s disease onset or even protect against Alzheimer?s pathogenesis, having a large effect on quality of life and health burden imposed by AD. This proposal tests the hypothesis that young plasma reverses hippocampal decline in plasticity and learning/memory in the aged brain through regulation of transcriptional programs, including gene networks involving Alzheimer?s pathogenesis. TIMP2 is a key blood-borne factor enriched in young plasma that enhances hippocampal Activator-protein 1 (AP-1) and other plasticity markers, while reversing hippocampal cognitive decline in aged mice. Experiments will examine young plasma-mediated and TIMP2-mediated enhancement of AP-1, a transcriptional regulator of genes involved in hippocampal function, including MMPs that are intimately tied to amyloid-? metabolism. I will investigate the role of TIMP2 in mediating transcriptional changes in plasticity and Alzheimer?s-related genes in the aged hippocampus and the extent to which TIMP2 is a necessary factor for the beneficial effects conferred by young plasma. The mechanism by which TIMP2 improves hippocampal function, including its site of action, duration of its transcriptional control, and the effect of long-term increased TIMP2 activity on limiting cognitive decline in aged mice will be investigated.  The results may inform therapies directed at restoring TIMP2 function as a treatment for Alzheimer?s disease.  To fully characterize transcriptional changes induced by both young plasma and blood-borne TIMP2, Aim 1 will use next-generation sequencing methods (RNA-seq and ChIP-seq) in aged hippocampal tissue from mice treated systemically with young plasma, TIMP2, or control. ChIP-seq will be performed to identify all genes bound and regulated by AP-1 following treatment. Aim 2 assesses the necessity of TIMP2 for the cognitive improvements and transcriptional changes (identified in Aim 1) mediated by young plasma. Mice treated with young plasma will be compared to those receiving TIMP2-depleted (or KO) plasma or control. Aim 3 examines TIMP2?s site of action for improvements in aged hippocampal function (peripheral vs central) using a neutralization approach. The duration of TIMP2?s transcriptional regulation following treatment and the transcriptional and cognitive consequences of long-term peripheral TIMP2 expression using a viral-mediated approach will be pursued. Together, these aims critically assess the role of systemic TIMP2 in reversing hippocampal cognitive decline as a means to limit the impact of Alzheimer?s disease."
"9266737","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Alzheimer's disease (AD) is characterized at post-mortem examination by high densities of ß-amyloid (Aß)-containing plaques and extensive neurogliosis in cortical brain regions, with severe loss of neurons, including the pyramidal neurons in the CA sub-regions of the hippocampus and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus (LC). AD is the most common cause of elderly dementia and women have a higher incidence of AD than men. The gradual loss of sex steroid hormones may contribute to age associated cognitive decline. A neuroprotective role of estrogens in murine models has been established. Specifically, 17-?-estradiol has been shown to stimulate enhanced synaptic plasticity, neurite growth, hippocampal neurogenesis and long-term potentiation. However, its effects on peripheral targets in humans limit the usefulness of ?-E2 as a potential therapy. Negative outcomes from the large Women's Health Initiative Memory Study (WHIMS), a clinical study using ?-E2 highlight the dire need to analyze non-feminizing estrogens. Recently, we discovered that 17-?-estradiol (?-E2), an isomer of 17?-estradiol, appear to mitigate the severiy of neuron loss, amyloid burden, and neuroglial proliferation in adult dtg APP/PS1 mice. To begin to address this hypothesis in-vivo, we propose to identify mechanisms for the neuroprotective effects of ?-E2 in APOE knock in (APOE3 and APOE4) and 5x FAD mice. Using equal numbers of both male and female mice, we will deliver ?E2 over sixty days via subcutaneous pellets. Sacrifice and brain removal will follow to identify if neuroprotective effects of ?E2 are mediated in a sex and/or apoE genotype dependent manner. Endpoints for these studies will be computerized stereology to quantify neuron loss in CA1 and LC, amyloid burden and neuroglial proliferation in the hippocampal formation; and enzyme-linked immunoassays to quantify levels of Aß peptides and pro-inflammatory cytokines in hippocampal molecular layers. Taken together, these experiments will provide perhaps the most direct in-vivo assessment of cellular sites for ?E2's neuroprotective effects in APOE knock-in (APOE3 and APOE4) and 5x FAD mice. Results will assess whether ?E2 deserves further study as a potential strategy for the therapeutic management of AD in middle-aged and elderly men and women."
"9220695","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Approximately 50% of HIV positive veterans develop HIV associated neurocognitive disorders, or HAND, despite adequate anti-HIV drug therapy. The neurologic disease associated with HIV infection ranges from asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment, only detected by sophisticated neuropsychological testing, to frank dementia. In industrialized nations like the United States, retroviral pharmacotherapy has reduced the incidence of severe dementia due to HIV infection, but the prevalence of HAND has unexpectedly risen (especially among the milder forms). The reason(s) for this is unclear; however, new data suggest that the antiretroviral agents (ARVs) used to combat HIV infection may independently exert central nervous system (CNS) toxicities and contribute to this increased prevalence of adverse neurologic symptomatology. The milder forms of HAND are more common, more insidious in their onset and can detrimentally impact a veteran's ability to remain healthy and financially secure. Surprisingly, the direct effects of ARV on functional signaling of CNS neurons has yet to be examined. Through this funding, we have the opportunity to fill that knowledge gap. The majority of the accumulated evidence that implicates anti-HIV drugs as potentially involved in cognitive dysfunction is inferred from in vitr experiments involving sensory neurons or derived from clinical studies that are mostly observational in their design. Understanding the mechanisms of the potential adverse effects of our treatments for HIV is the only way to minimize their negative impact on health. The primary goal of the proposed research is to examine ARVs for CNS neuronal toxicity in the absence of inflammation or infection. This will be investigated through physiological, anatomical, and behavioral approaches. By determining mechanisms of neurotoxicity in preclinical investigations, we can begin to develop rational treatments for these complications of ARV therapy and to adapt pharmacologic regimens to involve less toxic CNS effects in patients with existing cognitive dysfunction. As HAND may first manifest as mild cognitive impairment in spatiotemporal memory tasks, our research efforts will focus on these cortical brain regions known to be closely associated with memory tasks. The underlying hypotheses of the proposed work is that despite their efficacy in reducing HIV load, certain ARVs clinically associated with peripheral neuropathy will also impair normal cortical neuron anatomy, physiology, and synaptic transmission and these neurophysiological effects will lead to measurable changes on memory-associated tasks either acutely or via chronic exposure. To test my hypotheses, I am proposing to subject a diverse subset of the ARVs (8 separate drugs) to a battery of in vitro and ex vivo experiments in order to determine the effects of these drugs on the dendritic branching, excitability, and network activity of cortical neurons; thus establishing a biophysical profile of  potentially toxic ARV. I will then validate biophysical predictors of neurotoxicity using in vivo behavioral testing of memory disruption. And then establish an efficient biophysical screen for ARV-mediated neurotoxicity using the simplest biophysical testing modality which predicts the most severe memory impairments measured in the whole animal. Finally, I will apply only the necessary screening tools to all of the commonly prescribed ARVs to streamline the method of neurotoxicity detection. Through this mentored award, I will extend my laboratory skills beyond my background in neurophysiology to include behavioral and neuroanatomical techniques. Once armed with the necessary toolbox, I intend to develop an independent science program focusing on translating pharmacological testing to guiding clinical decisions in the neurosciences."
"9417473","Modified Project Summary/Abstract Section  This project is the R00 phase of a K99/R00 award to be completed in the Department of Pharmacology and Physiology at George Washington University. In this project, I will investigate the role of inhibitory synapses on VTA dopamine neurons in animal models of resilience and susceptibility to stress-induced anhedonia. Dopamine neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are a crucial part of the brain's reward processing system, and function of these neurons is greatly influenced by stress. In particular, activity of dopamine neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens has been causally linked to an animal's behavioral response to stress. Inhibitory synapses onto dopamine neurons powerfully modulate their activity, and are thus poised to be a significant mediator of stress's effects on the VTA. In this proposal, I will take a multidisciplinary approach, utilizing electrophysiological, optogenetic, chemogenetic, and behavioral techniques to address the hypothesis that inhibitory synapses onto nucleus accumbens-projecting VTA dopamine neurons are a key determinant of an individual's behavioral responses to stress. I propose two aims, revised from my original K99/R00 application. In the first, I will examine inhibitory synaptic physiology and plasticity onto nucleus accumbens projecting dopamine neurons in mice exhibiting differential responses to two forms of repeated stress: chronic social defeat and subchronic variable stress. In the second, I will examine changes in the strength of two specific inputs (local VTA interneurons and RMTg projections) onto nucleus accumbens-projecting dopamine neurons following chronic social defeat and the ability of chemogenetic manipulation of these inputs to promote resilience to this stressor. These studies hold the potential to contribute significantly to our understanding of how the reward system is altered by stress and may lead to novel avenues for the development of therapeutic treatments for depression and other stress-linked disorders."

Following the short course, the training program will continue for a two-year period in which students will have individualized mentoring and assessment. The training, which is designed to be applicable to diverse diseases of the nervous system, will equip students with a broad understanding of the various component steps in the neurotherapeutics drug discovery and development process. Students will learn how to identify a good drug discovery target; how to construct an assay; the elements of medicinal chemistry; how to conduct animal efficacy testing; the principles of ADME studies, safety testing, and formulation; the principles of experimental medicine and biomarkers; the steps required to prepare an IND document and the principles for interacting with the FDA; the principles of intellectual property as they relate to neurotherapeutics discovery and development; and how to seek funding for academic drug discovery research. They will also receive training in responsible conduct of research. Students will be equipped with the skills to develop and coordinate an entire drug discovery and development effort, and to work collaboratively with experts in each of the component areas. The training will combine didactic lectures with active engagement activities in which the students will be challenged to utilize the lecture material to work through their own drug discovery project plan with the guidance of the area experts. The 3½-day short course (followed by two-years of mentorship and assessment) will be offered annually, a total of five times."
"9266766","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): By age 40 years, individuals with Down syndrome (DS) show the neuropathological changes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and have a high risk for dementia, but little is known about the biomarkers that may predict clinical onset or reflect disease progression. This study focuses on a longitudinal and multidisciplinary determination of key biomarkers that are likely to define this progression, including levels and rates of change in blood based biomarkers such as ?-amyloid peptides, protein and lipid profiles, and measures of amyloid and tau concentration in cerebrospinal fluid, neuroimaging-based changes and genetic polymorphisms. Using a neurocognitive battery that we have developed and tested, systematic profiles of longitudinal stability and of decline will allow us to define dementia status, includin Mild Cognitive Impairment in DS (MCI-DS), and characterize progression in clinical status. Previously generated protein, inflammatory and lipid signatures will be examined, as well as amyloid and tau profiles in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Imaging biomarkers will include structural MRI components and PET studies of brain amyloid uptake. Analysis of MRI imaging biomarkers will include longitudinal measures of atrophy, white matter abnormalities and intrinsic network connectivity paradigms. Amyloid positron tomography will delineate regional and whole brain uptake of amyloid. Polymorphisms in candidate genes for AD and related biomarkers will be studied as potential modifiers of risk and their relation to beta amyloid, proteomic, lipidomic and imaging biomarkers examined. Relationships among demographic, clinical, blood based and CSF biomarkers, imaging measures, and genetic variants will be examined to develop the most valid indicators of preclinical and early stages of AD. Importantly, the data and the biological samples will be archived and banked to establish a resource to be shared with other scientists. Collectively, our investigators have a combined clinical and research experience involving over 1500 patients (30% demented), over 850 banked blood samples, 500 DNA samples, and 50 imaging studies. Further, team investigators have previous experience with all methods that will be included in this new project. Thus, this application brings together a group of co-investigators with established expertise in studies of DS and makes available a combined cohort of 280 participants."
"9274906","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Progressive, irreversible, neuronal damage already has occurred by the time clinical symptoms of Alzheimer disease (AD) are documented. However, biochemical, histopathological and gross anatomic features of AD begin to appear during its insidious onset, preceding dementia by decades. Because of their value for diagnosis, screening, prognosis and as endpoints in clinical trials, enormous effort is being expended to define and detect early markers of AD, particularly utilizing established medical imaging approaches such as MRI and PET, and mildly invasive approaches such as lumbar puncture. However, a suitable tool for early diagnosis of MCI subjects who are likely convert to AD is non-invasive and can be routinely used at the point of care. Also, next generation drugs targeting the root causes of AD will need to identify and recruit subjects at very early stages of the disease, who otherwise will convert to advanced stage AD, because treatment, if successful, needs to start early, preferably in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) due to AD or even asymptomatic subjects at the preclinical phase - again calling for practicable screening at the point of care. Currently, no clinically approved biomarker or imaging tool is available to identify such patients. The ability to identify MCI subjects who wil likely convert to AD and differentiate them from MCI non-converters will enable selection of the MCI converters as the most effective cohort for evaluating efficacy of trial therapeutics and will enable treatment, when available, at the earliest, most effective, stage of the disease.  This proposal is to advance a relatively inexpensive, widely deployable and non-invasive approach for early detection at-point-of-care and progress monitoring of AD. Using technology developed under prior Merit funding, we show that near-infrared optical spectroscopy (NIR) can differentiate AD, MCI (mild cognitive impairment) and control patients. However, not all MCI patients convert to full blown AD. Near infrared light can propagate several centimeters through living tissue to reach the brain, completely non-invasively. Their inherent physical-chemical properties make plaques and tangles detectable optically, without stains or labels: they are dense protein aggregates, which scatter light characteristically. Thus, a direct connection between the observed NIR optical spectra and the known neuropathological features of disease is provided, in vivo. On the other hand, in the absence of biopsy and pathology, biological markers are the most direct diagnostic link to underlying disease. The concentration ratios of amyloid beta peptides to tau proteins in cerebrospinal fluid has emerged as the most clinically validated and quantified prognostic marker for AD to date. However, CSF collection is invasive and is not a routine practice for asymptomatic subjects. Herein we propose to demonstrate that NIR spectroscopy can provide a non- invasive, more readily accessible and equally accurate screen for incipient AD, while at the same time providing information complementary to MRI and PET."

"9312021","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Understanding the molecular regulation of early mammalian development is of fundamental importance and may inform new therapeutic avenues in Reproductive Health and Regenerative Medicine. Our knowledge of early development is very limited and largely derived from studies of single copy protein-coding genes. However, single copy protein-coding genes comprise only a minor fraction (~2%) of our genome. About half of the mouse and human genomes is derived from Transposable Elements (TEs), which are sequences repeated throughout the chromosomes and in some cases capable of moving to different locations in the genome. Despite being generally silenced in differentiated cell types, certain classes of TEs are highly expressed in mouse and human pre-implantation embryos and pluripotent stem cells. The role of TEs in early mammalian development remains essentially unknown. Our preliminary data in mouse embryonic stem cells and embryos support a new model in which the alternative transcriptional programs of totipotency and pluripotency are regulated by distinct classes of TEs. We will test the hypothesis that RNA derived from one family of TEs acts in cis as a long non-coding RNA to bind specific sites in the chromatin and promote pluripotency in part by repressing another family of TEs. Elements of this second family of TEs, in turn, act as promoters for genes that drive expression of the totipotency program. In Aim 1, we will dissect the antagonistic role of specific TEs in mouse embryonic stem cells; in Aim 2, we will use cutting-edge technology to dissect the molecular mechanism of action of a critical family of TEs in embryonic stem cells; in Aim 3, we will define the molecular role of this TE in early mouse development. This proposal is anticipated to cast pre-implantation development in an entirely new light, uncovering specific TEs as key mediators of the totipotency-to-pluripotency transition and deciphering their mechanism of action. This knowledge is expected to have important implications for understanding and treating infertility, and for using pluripotent stem cells as a platform for studying and treating degenerative diseases."
"9313763","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application seeks five years of support to collect new two waves of data (2014-2019) from a panel of nearly 400 couples who participated in earlier waves of the Family Transitions Project (FTP; 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, and 1994) and the Midlife Transition Project (MTP; 2001). The purpose of returning to this panel is to document the continuity and change in couple relationships and health (broadly defined to include mental and physical health) over transition from middle to later years. The data assembled under FTP and MTP are now being augmented by a third project, a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS), whereby genetic data are being collected from the same adults. Nearly all of the participants are baby-boomers who are in their retirement years. Adding new two waves of data to these past waves provides a wealth of prospective data on men and women as they currently transition through the retirement years.  Previous research on the continuity and change in couple relationships and health over elder years is mixed. This may be attributed to the limited ability of previous studies to investigate the couples' interactions and relationship quality withi the contexts of long-term couple relationships and life histories, and the failure to take spouses' work and economic circumstances into account. Furthermore, most studies on couples' relationship in elder years have not been able to capitalize on new research regarding genetic markers. The proposed study is well-positioned to address these concerns. By combining new data with the earlier data described above, we will have extensive information on couples collected over a 25 year period. The data will include intensive assessments of marital, economic, and work histories, parental experiences, social status, support, and physical and mental health as well as genotypic information. This comprehensive perspective and the 'long-term view' offer the prospect of resolving contradictions in existing research. We will place the transition from midlife to later adulthood in a long-term life course and family contexts and examine continuity and change in couple relationships and health. We will also take into account the moderating effects of enduring vulnerabilities including those attributable to genetic markers. We will use the cutting-edge analytical techniques that have been the hallmark of our past research."
"9282544","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive framework for analyzing inequality in capabilities over the life course, with a focus on midlife to late life outcomes. Capabilities are the capacities to act. They shape the opportunity sets available to persons at each stage of their life cycle. We seek support to create a Research Network on the Determinants of Life Course Capabilities and Outcomes. Participants in the network will be leaders in their fields. The network will span disciplines including economics, psychology, genetics, sociology, and statistics. It will build on and extend existing collaborations and networks in place. The goal is to synthesize and extend understanding of the measurement and development of capabilities. New approaches for both measurement and development will be assessed and disseminated through training workshops. We will train a new generation of scholars not limited by traditional field boundaries. Scientific meetings will facilitate communication between psychologists, economists, geneticists, and others on frontier research topics. Alternative perspectives on the same research question will be presented; areas of commonality as well as differences will be identified and charted. Workshop content will emerge year by year in light of the findings reported at each conference. A pilot grant program will permit us to commission research projects which instantiate the syntheses that we envision emerging from these exchanges. Training workshops, which will focus on graduate students and new professionals, will provide mechanisms for creating a long-run research program training scholars in the tools and perspectives of the various disciplines."
"9256481","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The retina contains one of the best-studied G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR), the light-activated phototransduction cascade responsible for visual perception. As such it serves as a model for GPCR systems throughout the body, and yet there remain important unanswered questions about the feedback and modulation of GPCR signaling, especially as it affects termination of the cascade. The reliable shutoff is highly controlled in photoreceptors, and it establishes the temporal capabilities of the visual system. More importantly, photoreceptors can alter shutoff timing as an adaptation to changes in ambient illumination. These molecular events are understood in part, but further work is required to define the multiple mechanisms of adaptation. The first goal of this proposed research is to identify the conditions that elicit a newly discovered form of adaptation in rod photoreceptors and to ascertain the underlying mechanisms controlling it. This form of adaptation reveals a paradoxical hypersensitivity of our dim light photoreceptors following exposure to bright light. We propose to study this rod adaptation at cellular level as well as through clinical and behavioral tests in human subjects. This work will reveal new information about visual system adaptation during mesopic lighting conditions, the twice-daily twilight evolutionarily vital to bot the hunter and the hunted. Additionally, our efforts will provide a more thorough understanding of how the GPCR pathway can be modified to adapt to constant stimuli. Despite being the minority cell in the human visual system, cone photoreceptors have tremendous importance for daytime vision, spatial acuity, and color perception. At this point, there is a far better understanding of rod mechanisms, many of which do not directly translate to cone function. One important aspect that needs to be investigated is the immense adaptive range of cones and the speed with which they accomplish the task. Indeed, the temporal flicker resolution of cone vision measured behaviorally needs to be explained in more detail on the single cell level. A more complete understanding of cone function and adaptation will further not only the field of vision, but the entire field of neurobiology with respect to different GPCR signaling pathways."
"9214198","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Elevated levels of glucose and/or lipids in Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) are thought to negatively affect islet function and survival (so-called `glucotoxicity', `lipotoxicity', or `gluco-lipotoxiciy'), leading to a further impairment of insulin secretion and worsening glycemic control. However, much of the evidence for glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity has come from studies of rodent islets or rodent models of T2DM (ob/ob, db/db, ZDF, high-fat diet, etc.). This is problematic because human islets have critical differences from rodent islets. Thus, our understanding of the mechanistic events in human islets exposed to excess glucose and lipid in vivo is quite limited. These fundamental gaps in our knowledge, which are partly the result of experimental limitations of studying human islets in vivo and partly from limitations in our knowledge of human islet biology, restrict our ability to develop interventions to preserve beta cell function. To address these limitations, we developed new pre-clinical, experimental approaches that allow mechanistic analysis of human islets exposed to excess glucose and/or lipid in vivo (human islets transplanted into immunodeficient mice). Based on our in vivo and in vitro data, we hypothesize that excess glucose and/or lipid in vivo (glucotoxicity or lipotoxicity) compromises the function and/or expression of these key islet-enriched transcription factors in human islets, leading to impaired insulin secretion and biosynthesis and the worsening islet function in T2DM. We propose three aims to test this hypothesis: 1) Define the degree, duration, and mechanism(s) by which hyperglycemia alters human islet function in vivo. 2) Determine whether excess lipid worsens the effects of hyperglycemia on human islet function in vivo. 3) Determine whether excess glucose and/or lipid impair human islet function in vivo by similar or distinct mechanisms. The proposed studies bring together new information and technologies related to islet-enriched transcription factors and human islet biology, as well as new experimental models that allow for human islets to be studied in vivo in ways that have not previously been possible. The proposed studies address a critical problem in T2DM, namely the molecular mechanisms of glucotoxicity and/or lipotoxicity, and should drive new efforts to design interventions to preserve  or improve beta cell function."
"9275377","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Cigarette smoke (CS) suppresses the immune system, and smoking is the major risk factor for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exposure to cigarette smoke is associated with a significant increase in the risk for respiratory viral infections. Our work is to understand how CS compromises the human innate immune system's response to influenza virus infection, and to find novel methods to control the infection. Epidemiological studies show that influenza infection is seven times more common and is much more severe in smokers than nonsmokers. Retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) plays an important role in the recognition of, and cytokine induction by, influenza virus and other RNA viruses. Our previous studies, using an ex vivo human organ culture model, have found that cigarette smoke extract (CSE) suppresses antiviral and innate immune responses in influenza virus infected human lung through oxidative inhibition of viral-mediated induction of the pattern recognition receptor, RIG-I. This immunosuppressive effect of CS may play a role in the enhanced susceptibility of smokers to serious influenza infection in the lung. We propose to use an in vivo mouse model to study the mechanism by which CS suppresses the expression and function of the RIG-I initiated innate response to influenza virus. The hypothesis of this proposal is that long-term CS impairs the protective RIG-I initiated antiviral response to influenza virus in vivo while RIG-I overexpression and antioxidants provide therapeutic inhibition of immunosuppression from smoking.  To test the central hypothesis, we propose to pursue the following integrated specific aims: AIM 1: Is RIG-I knockdown by CS responsible for the suppression of the RIG-I initiated antiviral response in CS-exposed mice? AIM 2: Can RIG-I overexpression in mouse lung reverse the CS-mediated suppression of the antiviral response in CS-exposed mice? AIM 3: Can antioxidants restore the RIG-I initiated antiviral response in CS-exposed mice?  These studies will significantly enhance our understanding of the mechanism whereby CS suppresses the human immune system and predisposes humans to worse outcomes of influenza virus infection. Determination of the molecular mechanisms of immunosuppression will be important in designing strategies for the development of new and novel treatments for cigarette smoke enhanced lung infections, particularly those due to influenza."
"9275299","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is the precursor to most end-stage renal failure and is a potent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recent interest in CKD has focused on processes of structural change that occur later in the course of CKD when functioning kidney is replaced by scar tissue. We ascribe to the view that these processes begin as adaptive mechanisms, rooted in physiology, to compensate for an earlier injury, then go awry because the means to control them is lost. It is the general purpose of the proposed research to investigate cardinal features of kidney physiology early in the course of CKD by applying renal micropuncture methods in a standard model for early CKD, namely subtotal nephrectomy (STN) in the rat. We have discovered that feeding high NaCl diet to a rat during the first week after STN leads to a reversal of the tubuloglomerular feedback (TGF) response from negative to positive gain. While this will speed up the return to salt balance, it also signifies that the kidney is willing to forego the functional and hemodynamic stability normally conferred by TGF. This shift to anomalous TGF establishes a positive relationship between dietary salt intake and dynamic stretch-relaxation of the glomerular capillary wall, which may explain the nefarious effect of dietary salt in CKD. The upcoming research will determine whether this physiology remains relevant beyond the early stages of adaptation to nephron loss, whether it is a durable process that persists after high NaCl is withdrawn, whether it depends on Na, Cl, or both, and how it interacts with kidney metabolism."
"9267121","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The NIA Interventions Testing Program represents a multi-site translational research program to evaluate agents hypothesized to extend mouse lifespan by retardation of aging or postponement of late life diseases. Interventions proposed by multiple collaborating scientists from the research community are initially tested, in parallel, at three sites (Jackson Laboratories, Michigan and Texas), using identical, standardized protocols, and using sufficient numbers of genetically heterogeneous mice to provide 80% power for detecting changes in lifespan of 10%, for either sex, after pooling data from any two of the test sites. Forty such lifespan experiments, involving various doses of 25 distinct agents, have been initiated in the first nine years of the ITP. Significant effects on longevity, in one or both sexe, have been documented for 5 of the tested agents: aspirin, NDGA, rapamycin, acarbose, and 17-?-estradiol. Initial lifespan trials are now underway for 8 agents, as well as comprehensive analyses of the effects of rapamycin, acarbose, and NDGA on health and on cellular and physiological traits thought likely to mediate the beneficial effects seen. Plans for the next five year period include additional lifespan (Stage I) trials, detailed analyses (Stage II) of agent found to increase lifespan, and increased emphasis on collaborations with other scientists skilled at evaluating traits related to health and disease or at testing ideas about mechanisms of drug action on aging. Each of the three ITP laboratories will bring special expertise to the effort measures of age-sensitive traits at the Jackson Laboratory, pathology and statistical analysis at Michigan, and pharmacology at the University of Texas."

Although Mexican Americans are the largest subgroup, Caribbean Hispanics are the second largest subgroup in the U.S. The aging and rapid growth of the Hispanic population will lead to increases in the impact of stroke. Innovative strategies are needed to reduce stroke risk and eliminate disparities among Hispanics. Our Hispanic Stroke Prevention Intervention Research Program is a collaborative application from the University of Miami and the University of Puerto Rico aimed at reducing stroke disparities in the Hispanic community. The central theme of our program is risk factor control among Hispanics at risk of stroke. In project I, we will assess in a randomized trial the effectiveness o an innovative secondary stroke prevention intervention program to improve the control of risk factors, uses a health care delivery model that has been successful for chronic disease management in minority communities, integrates pharmacists in the enhancement of adherence, and state of the art mobile information technology. In project II, we will systematically evaluate the determinants of blood pressure variability and glucose control among high-risk Hispanic family members of stroke patients. We will assess novel psychosocial, sociocultural, healthcare system, and biological variables as part of a conceptual model that incorporates psychosocial adversities, reserve capacity, and cumulative vulnerabilities as determinants of 24hour blood pressure variability. In project III we will create the Florida Puerto Rico Stroke Registry by collating data from 140 hospitals that are currently collecting Get With the Guidelines-Stroke data to help identify stroke disparities by race, ethnicity, and region and educate stakeholders in approaches to improve stroke quality regarding stroke disparities. Our program includes three cores: administrative core, the research/education training core, and the data management and statistics core. Our multidisciplinary program unites investigators across two minority-serving institutions, addresses significant gaps in our knowledge of stroke risk in Hispanics, and will provide results that can have an immediate impact on future primary and secondary stroke prevention efforts."

"9303651","Primary progressive aphasia (PPA) is an adult onset disease that selectively attacks the left hemisphere language network. Despite considerable progress in this field, patients with PPA and their families remain underserved. Accurate medical diagnosis can be challenging outside of specialized centers, relevant educational materials are scarce, few speech and language pathologists in the community are equipped to provide informed interventions, and many patients tend to be excluded from clinical trials because the complex relationship to underlying neuropathology is not fully appreciated. This proposal comes from a team of investigators with a primary focus on PPA. It seeks to pursue a research program that is now in its 10th year and that has recruited nearly 150 patients for longitudinal investigation. As a consequence of the proposed work we expect to sharpen our understanding of lexicosemantic and grammatical impairments experienced by the patient, obtain new insights into the organization of the left-hemisphere language network, clarify the diagnostic fingerprints of PPA caused by Alzheimer?s disease versus frontotemporal degenerations, and increase the precision with which we can trace the temporal trajectory of the disease. The work will also continue to generate collateral benefits in the form of new educational materials for patients and families, improved recognition of the syndrome, potentially greater access of PPA patients to relevant clinical trials, and the training of students and fellows who will develop into the next generation of clinicians and investigators serving the needs of patients with PPA."
"9289668","Parkinson?s disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by severe motor deficits caused by the progressive loss of striatal dopamine (DA) input and it is commonly treated with the DA precursor L-DOPA or by DA D2 receptor (D2R) agonists. Although L-DOPA ameliorates the motor deficits, prolonged use leads to motor abnormalities, termed L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Despite these limitations, L-DOPA is the mainstay for PD treatment. Various animal models of PD suggest that dyskinesias are associated with enhanced G-protein mediated signaling at DA receptors (DARs) and this leads to changes in gene expression and uncontrolled neuronal excitability. Research over the past decade has shown that DARs can signal not only through G-proteins, but also also through ?- arrestin2 (?arr2) scaffolds containing signaling complexes that initiate intracellular signals distinct from those of G- proteins. Recently we have demonstrated in PD models that over-expression of ?arr2 in the striata of mouse, rat, or macaque reduces L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. This novel approach facilitated locomotion and simultaneously desensitized G-protein signaling, thereby reducing the dyskinesia without potentially affecting other neurotransmitter systems. The Overall Goal of the proposed research is to provide preclinical results for taking novel D1R and D2R ?arr-biased compounds into clinical PD trials. Our Central Hypothesis is that small molecule drugs that selectively activate the ?arr, but not the G-protein, pathway at D1Rs/D2Rs will have anti-parkinsonian activities without inducing dyskinesias. We have three Specific Aims. Aim 1 will develop ?arr-biased D1R and D2R ligands from the leads/hits we recently discovered. Aim 2 will assess the in vitro profile of the newly synthesized ?arr-biased compounds. Aim 3 will determine the in vivo effects of D1R and D2R ?arr-biased compounds in animal models of PD."
"9218182","This laboratory study will evaluate whether a cannabinoid enhances the analgesic efficacy of an opioid in a clinical sample of chronic pain patients, laying the foundation for a larger clinical trial evaluating the utility of cannabinoids as potentially opioid-sparing adjuvants to chronic opioid therapy for pain. Heightened CNS processing, or central sensitization (CS), occurs across numerous chronic pain conditions and is an important treatment target in its own right. While cannabinoids show initial promise as treatments or adjuncts for some chronic pain conditions and pre-clinical data suggest effects on CS, little is known about the degree to which combining cannabinoids with opioids alleviates CS-mediated chronic pain. We propose a within-subject, single exposure, double-blind, placebo-controlled, human laboratory investigation of the extent to which a cannabinoid enhances opioid analgesia in a model chronic pain population (e.g., patients with knee osteoarthritis). Human laboratory studies are an ideal method for this initial evaluation because they provide the opportunity to tightly control study drug dosing and afford high sensitivity of measurements, and enable tight control of confounding variables that may otherwise exist in clinical treatment populations and could differentially impact outcomes. This approach will minimize the number of participants needed to determine whether a positive signal exists while permitting rigorous and elegant evaluation of the study aims. Primary study outcomes will include measures of clinical pain and central sensitization, physical function, drug effects (e.g., abuse liability, adverse events, cognitive performance), and pharmacokinetic analyses. The Aims will examine the magnitude and duration of cannabinoid/opioid combination in reducing clinical pain and central sensitization; the effects on physical functioning, adverse events and indices of abuse liability; and the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles for the individual and combined drugs. This study will provide the most systematic and rigorous evaluation of the potential for cannabinoids to enhance analgesic effects of opioids in human subjects to date, and will do so in a relevant and generalizable clinical pain population who has CS, which makes these results more directly relevant compared to studies conducted in healthy populations. These findings will be critical to informing the efficacy and safety profile for the advancement of opioid/cannabinoid combination regimens to clinical trials with chronic pain patients."
"9206096","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disease affecting up to a million people in the United States. Estimates of incidence of PD range from 18 to 182 per 100,000, making it the second-most neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer's disease. It is increasingly becoming clear that exposure to different war zone chemicals increases the risk of having Parkinson's disease (PD). Accordingly, many of the Vietnamese Veterans who were exposed to a number of toxic chemicals collectively called Agent Orange and are currently getting old and are exhibiting signs of PD. However, in spite of extensive research, no effective therapy is available to halt the progression of PD or other neurodegenerative disorders. In spite of extensive research on the pathogenesis of PD, no effective therapy is available to halt this devastating neurodegenerative process. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) is a potent factor for survival and growth of dopaminergic neurons. Accordingly a decrease in GDNF production in the brain has been shown to play an important role in nigrostriatal degeneration in PD. Therefore, increasing the level of trophic factor GDNF in the nigrostriatum is considered as an important step in halting the neurodegeneration in PD. Although gene manipulation and stereotaxic injection of GDNF directly into the brain are available options, it seems from the therapeutic angle, the best option would be to stimulate/induce the production of GDNF in vivo in the CNS of patients with PD. Is it really possible? Our novel results show that it is possible with cinnamon, a commonly used natural spice and flavoring material used for centuries throughout the world, and its metabolite sodium benzoate (NaB), an FDA-approved drug for hyperammonemia and a widely-used food additive. We have found that oral feeding of ground cinnamon increases the level of GDNF and neurturin (NTN) in the CNS of normal mice and MPTP-intoxicated mice, an animal model of PD. Similarly, cinnamon metabolite NaB also upregulates the expression of GDNF and NTN in human and mouse astrocytes. Therefore, from the academic angle, we have dedicated Specific aim I to investigate molecular mechanisms behind novel trophic factor- upregulating activity of cinnamon. Because cinnamon increased the level of trophic factors GDNF and NTN, we have devoted Specific aim II to investigate if oral administration of cinnamon and NaB attenuates pathological events and improves locomotor activities in chronic MPTP mouse model and A53T a-syn transgenic mouse model of PD. We have discovered that cinnamon and NaB induce GDNF and NTN via PPARa. Therefore, Specific aim III has been enshrined to delineate if cinnamon and NaB requires the PPARa - GDNF/NTN pathway to protect dopaminergic neurons. Taken together, a positive outcome of this grant proposal will highlight undiscovered properties of NaB and cinnamon, and enhance the possibility of treating patients with PD or other neurodegenerative disorders with cinnamon, its metabolite NaB or agonists of PPARa as primary or adjunct therapy."
"9285598","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Insufficiency or defectiveness of type I collagen is the cause of osteogenesis imperfect (OI), an inherited disorder characterized by abnormal bone development with an increased lifetime risk of fractures. Exome sequencing of a family presenting with OI phenotypes ranging from mild with few fractures to prenatal lethality revealed a mutation in CREB3L1, encoding a basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor. CREB3L1 has been reported once before in association with OI but the disease mechanism is still unclear. Collagen proteins are quite large and their transport from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi for packaging and eventual secretion is achieved using specialized secretory machinery. A closely related protein to CREB3L1, CREB3L2, has a role in regulating one such pathway in chondrocytes and is important for proper cartilage formation. Impaired functionality of CREB3L1 due to mutation may perturb the same or a related pathway in osteoblasts and lead to reduced type I collagen in bone, explaining the OI. There is also evidence that CREB3L1 operates in cell-type specific physiological ER stress pathways that may contribute to the phenotype. Fibroblasts from the proband are available but do not express CREB3L1. CREB3L1-associated OI will be modeled using both induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived osteoblasts from patient cells bearing the deletion and zebrafish engineered with the family mutation. These models will be used to look for evidence of the impaired secretion that is hypothesized and to define the role of CREB3L1 in various pathways that operate during bone development. Both models will serve as confirmation of CREB3L1 as an OI disease gene and potentially as tools for the design of new drugs or treatments for brittle bone disease."
"9330448","Project Summary/Abstract Hypertension, a primary risk factor for stroke, causes artery remodeling which leads to impairments in autoregulation of blood flow and impaired neuronal function. The mechanisms by which artery remodeling and impaired autoregulation occur with hypertension remain unknown. Elevated aldosterone levels and mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) activation have been linked to vascular damage in hypertension, and stroke. In rat models of hypertension, MR antagonism prevents hypertensive artery remodeling, but the mechanisms of action and the specific cell types involved in the process have not been identified because MR antagonists inhibit the actions of aldosterone in all cell types in the arteries. Endothelial MR signaling in peripheral arteries plays a critical role in cardiovascular injury. The endothelial MRs regulate vasodilation in peripheral arteries through calcium-activated potassium (KCa) channels, in particular, small conductance (SKCa) and intermediate conductance (IKCa) channels. These channels can be activated by calcium (Ca2+) influx through transient receptor potential (TRP) channels such as the A1 and V4. The endothelial cells in cerebral arteries expressing MRs are anatomically unique which prevents us from extrapolating the findings in the periphery to the brain. The proposed studies will assess, for the first time, how MR activation regulates endothelial cell Ca2+ homeostasis through SKCa/IKCa, TRPA1 and TRPV4 channels in the cerebral microcirculation. We will address these problems by utilizing endothelial cell specific MR knockout (ECMRKO) mice as a tool to evaluate the role of endothelial MR activation in calcium (Ca2+)-mediated endothelial dysfunction in the cerebral microcirculation during hypertension. We hypothesize that hypertension will result in changes in endothelial Ca2+ signaling that will impair endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the parenchymal arterioles. Furthermore, we propose that endothelial cell deletion of the MR in hypertensive mice will prevent impaired Ca2+ mediated endothelium- dependent dilation. We will focus on the effects of endothelial MR activation on hypertensive cerebral artery function; however, our findings could have wide reaching implications for stroke and vascular dementia."
"9269959","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is known for causing pneumonia and invasive pneumococcal diseases (IPDs), which are often lethal among elderly adults. Its virulence is mainly due to its expression of one of more than 90 serologically distinct polysaccharide (PS) capsules (i.e., serotypes). Most pneumococcal serotypes cause IPDs in both young children and elderly adults; however, for unknown reasons, pneumococci expressing the serotype 11A capsule cause IPDs almost exclusively in elderly adults or patients with cancer.  We have shown that ficolin-2 (L-ficolin), which can trigger the lectin pathway of the complement- activation cascade, deposits complement on 11A pneumococci, providing a natural protection against serotype 11A IPDs in young persons. We also found that the sera of many elderly (but not young) adults have ficolin-2 inhibitors and ligands. Since ficolin-2 can bind host apoptotic cells and mitochondria as well as pathogens, host cell fragments found in elderly and cancer patients may bind and inhibit ficolin-2. In addition, ficolin-2 inhibitors would reduce complement activation by the pneumococcal PS vaccine (PPV23), which contains 23 PSs including the 11A PS, and may thus reduce the immunogenicity to PPV23. To explain the presence of ficolin-2 inhibitors among the elderly, we have hypothesized that many elderly adults and cancer patients have host cell fragments in the circulation that bind and inhibit ficolin-2, reduce the immunogenicity of PPV23, and reduce hosts' survival.  To examine this hypothesis, we will A) Determine the epidemiology of ficolin-2 inhibitors using archived and fresh sera from elderly adults and cancer patients; B) Investigate the effects of ficolin-2 inhibitors on clinical outcomes in elderly adults by (i) investigating the inhibitors' abilities to interfere with other lectin- pathway activators, (ii) their correlations wth other aging-associated parameters, and (iii) their responses to PPV23; and C) Identify the molecular nature of ficolin-2 inhibitors as ficolin-2 ligands with western blotting and mass spectrometry. Our studies will be greatly facilitated because of our prior experience in micro-scale purification and peptide sequencing of serum proteins and because of the availability of sera and information from an on-going 10-year study of the elderly at our university.  Although ficolin-2 binds numerous pathogens and host cell fragments, its roles in inflammation and infections are relatively unknown due to its recent discovery. Identification of the inhibitors' molecular nature will provide mechanistic insights into this novel acquired deficiency of innate immunity common among the elderly. By enhancing our understanding of the aging-associated increase in infection susceptibility and decline of the immune function, our proposed studies are directly relevant to the medical care of the elderly. Additionally, these studies will also have a broad relevance and impact on biology in general because ficolin-2 is an evolutionarily ancient molecule that has likely been integrated into many fundamental biologic processes."
"9311842","Cerebral hemodynamic impairment due to high-grade carotid artery stenosis can impair cognition even in the absence of stroke, contributing to cognitive decline either directly, or as a consequence of a higher occurrence of silent infarction. Although there is good preliminary evidence from case series and physiological studies that hemodynamic impairment affects cognition in patients with carotid occlusive disease, treatment of this condition has never been tested in a randomized clinical trial. We propose to conduct an ancillary study to the NINDS-sponsored CREST-2 trial, a pair of outcome-blinded, Phase 3 clinical trials for patients with asymptomatic high-grade carotid artery stenosis which will compare carotid endarterectomy plus optimal medical therapy (OMT) versus OMT alone (n=1,240), and carotid artery stenting plus OMT versus OMT alone (n=1,240) to prevent stroke and death. . Our application addresses the intriguing question of whether cognitive impairment can be reversed when it arises from abnormal cerebral hemodynamic perfusion in a hemodynamically impaired subset of the CREST-2 ?randomized patients. We will enroll 500 patients from CREST-2, all of whom receive cognitive assessments at baseline and yearly thereafter. We will identify 100 patients with hemodynamic impairment as measured by an inter- hemispheral MRI perfusion ?time to peak? (TTP) delay on the side of stenosis. Among those who are found to be hemodynamically impaired and have baseline cognitive impairment, the cognitive batteries at baseline and at 1 year will determine if those with flow failure who are assigned to revascularization arm in CREST-2 will have better cognitive outcomes than those in the medical- only arm compared with this treatment difference for those who have no flow failure. We hypothesize that hemodynamically significant ?asymptomatic? carotid disease may represent one of the few examples of treatable causes of cognitive impairment. If cognitive decline can be reversed in these patients, then we will have established a new indication for carotid revascularization independent of the risk of recurrent stroke."
"9323233","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Microglia and astrocytes are key cells that recognize, interpret, propagate and regulate immune responses. In the elderly, peripheral infections can trigger delirium and behavioral disturbances. Moreover, ongoing inflammatory processes in the elderly are associated with depressive-like complications. These complications are not a normal part of aging and negatively affect quality of life and life-span. The cause of this altered communication between the immune system and the brain with age is unclear, but our data points to an impaired regulation of microglia. We have reported that microglia from aged mice are primed and become hyperactive following a peripheral immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Aged microglia produce amplified levels of both inflammatory (IL-1) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines. Although IL-10 is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, LPS-induced microglial activation in the aged brain is prolonged and is associated with development of depressive-like behavior. Our revised proposal addresses this critical problem in an innovative manner by identifying astrocytes as the pivotal cell in the failure to resolve microglial activation in the aged brain following immune challenge. Novel data provided here indicate that activated astrocytes in the aged brain have decreased IL-10 receptor-1 expression with corresponding reduced sensitivity to IL-10. This IL-10 insensitivity of aged astrocytes results in failure to produce TGF? and attenuate microglial activation. These findings fill a majo gap in the field about how microglia are regulated to prevent exaggerated neuroinflammation. Thus, the goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that prolonged neuroinflammation in the aged brain following a peripheral inflammatory challenge is caused by impaired astrocyte-dependent regulation of microglia. To address this hypothesis, three specific aims are proposed. In Aim-1, we will determine the degree to which reduced IL-10 sensitivity of aged astrocytes impairs their ability to regulate active microglia in vivo and ex vivo. Age-related issues in the functionality of IL-10/IL-10R1 signaling in astrocytes following immune challenge will be delineated and corresponding deficits in TGF?/TGF?R signaling in microglia will be determined. We will use several unique approaches to determine microglia and astrocyte mRNA copy number, protein expression, morphology, and ex vivo interactions in adult and aged mice after immune challenge. In Aim-2, we will ascertain the extent to which viral gene therapy enhancement of IL-10R1 specifically on astrocytes restores microglial regulation and prevents depressive-like behavior in aged mice following immune challenge. In Aim-3, we will determine if restoration of TGF? in the aged brain circumvents IL-10 insensitivity of astrocytes after immune challenge and attenuates microglia hyper-activation and prevents depressive-like behavior. Understanding how impaired IL-10 re-programming of astrocytes contributes to neuroinflammation and depressive-like behavior will lead to new interventions that target astrocytes in order to reduce neuropsychiatric complications associated with inflammatory challenge in the aged."
"9265723","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): There is now large-scale epidemiological evidence that aspects of chronic psychological stress, such as early adversity or job strain, and early life stress, predict earlier disease onset and mortality. Despite documentation of the importance of stress to health, there are several critical barriers that prevent progress in the epidemiological study of stress as a risk factor for disease. Measurement of stress is inherently complex and multi-level (e.g., social, psychological, physiological). There are few agreed upon 'gold standard' measures of stress, hence measurement is often inconsistent and superficial where heterogeneous constructs are conflated. There is also little understanding of the conditions under which stress exposure can promote vulnerability vs. resiliency to disease. Meanwhile, there have been rapid advances in the basic science of stress processes, which have helped to unpack the cognitive and affective components, links to brain and peripheral physiological responses, and richer measures of daily stress - e.g., through ecological momentary assessments using technology to obtain detailed profiles of exposures and contexts. Thus, epidemiological stress science can benefit from a more coherent multilevel model that encompasses better measurement of lifespan exposures and responses, including the social, psychological, and physiological indices of stress that have the greatest impact on health. The proposed R24 will recruit excellent scientists with relevant methods to apply their interests to th advancement of stress measurement across human development, with a focus on how lifespan stress affects health in mid to late life. Aims include: 1) Development of a stress measurement taxonomy, including guidelines for best measurement; 2) Development of a 'toolbox' of short measures of stress that can be used in epidemiological studies of adult aging internationally. These will be drawn from innovative measurement from basic experimental and field research, refinement/shortening of existing measures, and results from comparative validation of promising measures; and 3) Promotion of stress research in epidemiological studies of aging, both through harmonizing existing measures and adding new toolbox measures. This in turn will lead to discoveries that refine the taxonomy and research methodologies. Improved stress measurement offers tremendous opportunities for advancing the field of basic research, enhancing the efficacy of health-promotion interventions and policy."
"9268536","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recently, several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been published for late onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD). Each GWAS that has been published to date has mapped the Apolipoprotein E (APOE) locus as the strongest LOAD risk signal within the human genome. This has led us and others to hypothesize that this large signal can 1. Overwhelm other smaller effects that are in epitasis with the APOE E4 locus and 2. Be de-convoluted into multiple risk loci mapping to the same area of the genome. The first hypothesis is plausible, considering that in our previous GWAS we mapped an effect that was only present in APOE E4 positive individuals. The second hypothesis is also valid in that this type of effect (i.e. multiple risk loci mapping to the same region of the genome) has been seen in other neurological diseases. For example, for Fronto-temporal Dementia Linked to Chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), mutations in both the microtubule associated protein Tau gene (MAPT) as well as Progranulin (PRGN) have been found. Both MAPT and PRGN map within the same linkage peak on chromosome 17. Thus, we propose to leverage our genome-wide and Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) genetic data, as well as transcriptome and proteome datasets to map novel risk loci for LOAD that are acting either in epistasis with or independently of the APOE E4 allele.  We propose the following: To test our APOE E4 independent effects, we will perform additional NGS sequencing within the same region of chromosome 19 to capture additional effects (Aim 1a). We will also genotype the variants we found from our NGS in additional case control samples to determine whether they act independently of APOE E4 to increase risk for disease (Aim 1b). To follow our APOE E4 epistatic effects, SNPs which we found to act in conjunction with APOE E4 will be followed by examining an additional cohort (Aim 2a) as well as sequencing within the region to find additional variants (Aim 2b). Finally, we will map the downstream effects of any variants we map in Aims 1 or 2 by examining transcript expression and protein profiles (Aim 3), Our collaboration possesses the unique skills and datasets to perform this work. Drs. Huentelman and Myers have worked together for the greater part of their careers and have co-authored many publications using similar techniques as those proposed in this application. They have access to a unique cohort of ~ 1600 neuropathologically verified individuals, which will allow for both the analysis of risk variation as well as the downstream changes of those variants. They have recruited an additional cohort of ~ 18,000 clinically characterized samples from the University of Cardiff to replicate any effects. They also have access to both the computational power (48-core / 576GB memory computer and a separate 2,700-core cluster through Tgen and one of 5000 CPU at the University of Miami) as well as the expertise to execute the bioinformatics analysis involved in all Aims."
"9274902","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Many patients with mild Alzheimer's disease (AD) and the pre-Alzheimer's state of amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) live alone in the community. Memory dysfunction is the hallmark of AD and aMCI, and when their memory is sufficiently impaired, patients with these disorders will need to be provided with additional services, live with family, or move to an assisted living facility. Although memory dysfunction has been related with AD for over a century, the specific memory impairment observed in aMCI and mild AD has only recently been investigated. Building upon our prior work, the present proposal will systematically manipulate and evaluate different components of memory (e.g., familiarity, recollection, monitoring, source memory, the distinctiveness heuristic) that may be differentially affected by AD pathology. By understanding which components of memory are preferentially impaired, and which are relatively preserved, future interventions can be designed to help these patients live more independently. Aim 1 will test the hypothesis that patients with aMCI and mild AD are over-reliant upon familiarity. Experiments 1 and 2 combine subjective reports, behavioral measures, and event-related potentials (ERPs) to understand the changes that occur in memory with a study-test delay (Expt. 1), or with several manipulations to alter the familiarity of items, includng fluency, repetition of items at various lags, and different exemplars of items (Expt. 2). Experiment 3 will attempt to lower familiarity-based false recognition and raise true recognition using deep encoding. Experiment 4 will examine whether metacognitive instructions can facilitate use of the distinctiveness of pictures to improve memory in a supermarket scenario. Aim 2 will test the hypothesis that memory is impaired in patients with aMCI and mild AD in part due to their poor ability to monitor their responses. Experiment 5 manipulates the underlying ratio of studied to unstudied items at test and queries subjects regarding their perception of how many old and new items they have seen. Experiment 6 evaluates whether informing patients of the underlying ratio of studied versus unstudied items can reduce false recognition and improve overall memory when there are fewer studied than unstudied items. Aim 3 will test the hypothesis that false memories of imagined activities in patients with aMCI and AD are increased by poor source memory and over- dependence upon familiarity, and reduced by conditions that diminish source memory confusion. Experiment 7 evaluates true and false memories of actions simply heard and not imagined. Experiment 8 evaluates whether warnings at study and test can reduce false memories associated with the imagined activities, thereby improving overall memory. Taken together, the laboratory findings generated from experiments in this proposal provide the necessary translational steps to develop strategies that may enhance memory and improve the lives of patients with aMCI and mild AD."
"9314021","Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of death in the U.S. The U.S. Public Health Service Smoking Cessation Guideline recommends offering effective treatment that includes both medication and counseling to smokers in all health care settings, including hospitals. Nearly 4 million smokers are hospitalized each year, and hospital admission offers a ?teachable moment? for intervention. In-hospital smoking cessation intervention is efficacious, but only if contact continues for more than 1 month after discharge. The challenge is to translate this efficacy research into clinical practice. Sustaining treatment after discharge is the major barrier to identifying a scalable, sustainable, cost-effective model for U.S. hospitals. Building on our prior work, this competitive renewal project compares the effectiveness of 2 innovative strategies that aim to sustain treatment after discharge. Both interventions are integrated into the electronic health record (EHR) and leverage technology to engage patients and streamline the delivery and uptake of evidence-based tobacco cessation treatment, but they differ in intensity and resources required. Specific Aim: To compare the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of 2 interventions to increase hospitalized smokers? long-term tobacco abstinence after discharge. Study Design: A multi-site randomized controlled comparative effectiveness trial will enroll 1350 adult smokers admitted to 3 hospitals in 3 states (MA, PA, and TN). All subjects will have a standardized in- hospital smoking intervention and be randomly assigned at discharge to Personalized Tobacco Care Management (PTCM) or Quitline eReferral (eReferral). PTCM, built on our prior work, offers smokers 4 weeks of free nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) in hand at discharge (refillable x 1) and 7 proactive automated contacts over 3 months via their preference of interactive voice response (IVR) phone calls or text messages. Each contact promotes cessation and offers access to a tobacco coach based in the health system who coordinates treatment with the smoker?s health care team via the EHR. eReferral is a less intensive, lower cost option in which smokers receive a one-time automated referral from the EHR to the state quitline at discharge. The quitline offers multi-session telephone counseling, 4 weeks of free mailed NRT, and sends a feedback report to the EHR. Outcomes, assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after hospital discharge, are: (1) intervention effectiveness (biochemically-validated past 7-day tobacco abstinence at 6 month follow-up [1o outcome] and other tobacco abstinence measures); (2) smoking cessation treatment utilization, and (3) cost- effectiveness (incremental cost per quit). We will explore the interventions? effects on hospital readmissions and mortality after discharge. Impact: New National Hospital Quality Measures (NHQM) adopted by Medicare and Medicaid programs include tobacco treatment measures, giving hospitals an incentive to adopt these interventions. Completion of this study will provide critical cost and effectiveness data to guide hospitals as they develop strategies to comply with NHQM, reduce patients? smoking, and improve clinical outcomes."

"9275456","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Degenerative arthritis is the most common cause of disability in the US and affects more than 50% of the population over age 65. One form of degenerative arthritis, calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) deposition disease (CPPD) is strongly associated with common conditions in the Veteran population including advanced age, prior joint injury and osteoarthritis (OA). While CPP crystals are known to accelerate articular tissue damage though multiple mechanisms, the etiology of CPP crystal formation remains unclear. Overproduction of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate (ePPi) by chondrocytes is an absolute requirement for CPP crystal formation and enzymatic hydrolysis of extracellular ATP (eATP) by the ecto-enzyme ENPP1 is the rate limiting step in ePPi production. As there is ample ENPP1 on articular chondrocytes to convert all available substrate, it follows that increased concentrations of eATP in cartilage cause CPPD. We recently reported that the multipass transmembrane protein, ANK, which was originally described as a PPi transporter, critically regulates eATP levels in adult articular chondrocyte cultures. ANK is a highly conserved protein which is widely distributed, uniquely structured, and lacks a clearly defined function. The purpose of the work proposed here is to prove that ANK functions as an eATP transporter, that ANK is the dominant ATP efflux pathway in OA chondrocytes, and that ANK suppression with the FDA-approved drug, probenecid will reduce synovial fluid ATP levels in CPPD. The following specific aims will be accomplished with Xenopus oocytes, human and murine chondrocytes, and patients with CPPD. Specific Aim 1. To prove that ANK functions as an ATP transporter by A) demonstrating that ANK increases eATP efflux in a Xenopus oocyte expression system, and B) using site-directed mutagenesis to determine structure-function relationships in ANK null murine chondrocytes Specific Aim 2. To test the hypotheses that ANK over-expression A) causes CPPD in human OA cartilage by dysregulating normal eATP efflux mechanisms in an arachidonic acid-dependent manner, and B) will produce CPP crystals in murine cartilage in the presence of pyrophosphatase inhibitors Specific Aim 3. To demonstrate that probenecid, an ANK inhibitor and FDA approved drug, reduces synovial fluid [ATP] and [PPi] in patients with CPPD. In addition to providing a source of ePPi for CPP crystal formation, eATP produces cartilage damage by signaling through purinergic receptors to elicit catabolic effectors and to cause pain, and serves as a cofactor for innate immune signals leading to inflammation. ANK is a highly conserved protein which is widely distributed, uniquely structured, and remains poorly understood. Once this work is complete, we will understand ANK's role in eATP efflux in normal and OA chondrocytes, have established the feasibility of creating a mouse model of CPPD, and will have collected pilot data rationalizing the use of the ANK inhibitor, probenecid, to improve clinical outcomes in patients suffering from CPPD."
"9266341","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Picornaviruses replicate via RNA intermediates in the cytoplasm of infected cells, producing dsRNAs that activate antiviral host responses, including the OAS-RNase L pathway. Recently, we discovered a viral RNA molecule that inhibits the endoribonuclease domain of RNase L, and we characterized individual steps of RNA replication, including reiterative transcription mechanisms required for viral RNA polyadenylation. Enterovirus RNA polymerase (3Dpol) is well characterized at the structural level, yet, it is still unclear how conserved amino acid sequences and structures in the polymerase mediate distinct aspects of viral RNA replication. We intend to focus on a dsRNA clamp of 3Dpol that holds RNA products of viral replication as they exit the polymerase. Our preliminary data indicate that mutations in the dsRNA clamp of 3Dpol are maintained in infectious virus; however, these mutations impact the polyadenylation of viral RNA, the fidelity of viral RNA replication, the sensitivity of virus to ribavirin and virus fitness. We expect these mutations will also affect virl RNA recombination. After completing the experiments described in this application, we will better understand the structural features of 3Dpol and the manner in which they function. These studies are important for our understanding of antiviral drugs that target viral polymerases and the mechanisms by which recombinant viruses arise in nature, including recombination among wildtype enteroviruses and poliovirus vaccines. Ribonuclease L (RNase L) is an endoribonuclease associated with antiviral and antibacterial defense, cancer and lifespan. Despite the biological significance of RNase L, the RNAs cleaved by this enzyme are poorly defined. We plan to use novel deep sequencing methods to identify the host and viral RNAs targeted by RNase L and determine the functional effect of cleavage in host and viral RNAs. After completing the experiments described in this application, we will better understand how RNase L exerts its antiviral activity and how viruses overcome the antiviral activity of RNase L. Our study will also reveal how RNase L-dependent cleavage sites in 18S rRNA impact ribosome function; thereby revealing how one molecular target of RNase L impacts multiple phenotypes (antiviral activity, apoptosis, cancer and lifespan). New deep sequencing methods provide unprecedented opportunities to better understand virus replication and pathogenesis. During the previous funding period, we developed and validated cyclic phosphate cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing methods which reveal the frequency and location of antiviral endoribonuclease cleavage sites in host and viral RNAs. Other members of the research community developed circle cDNA sequencing to measure the fidelity of viral RNA replication. Together, these two deep sequencing methods provide the means for substantial new insights into the host-virus interactions that determine the outcomes of virus infections. We intend to use these new deep sequencing methods, in conjunction with other well-established experimental conditions, to build upon recent discoveries."
"9268510","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a K23 award application for Dr. Zachary A. Miller, a behavioral neurologist at the University of California, San Francisco Memory and Aging Center (MAC) who is establishing himself as a young investigator in patient-oriented clinical research focusing on language processing in neurodegenerative disease. This K23 award will provide Dr. Miller with the necessary support to accomplish the following: (1) gain expertise in neurodegenerative disease and the cognitive neuroscience of language processing; (2) develop proficiency in the use and analysis of structural and functional neuroimaging; (3) gain experience in evaluating neurodevelopmental and genetic factors in neurodegenerative patients; (4) advance his knowledge of biostatistics; (5) gain exposure and training in the neuropathology of language disorders; and (6) develop an independent clinical research career. To achieve these goals, he assembled a multidisciplinary mentoring team with two primary mentors: Dr. Maria Luisa Gorno-Tempini (a neurologist with expertise in language disorders and advanced neuroimaging techniques) and Dr. Bruce Miller (a neurologist with expertise in behavior, neurodegenerative disease, and clinical research); a co-mentor: Dr. Srikantan Nagarajan (a bioengineer with expertise in magnetoencephalography); and three advisors: Dr. Matt State (a psychiatrist with expertise in neurodevelopmental disorders and genetics), Dr. William Seeley (a neurologist with expertise in neuropathology and functional imaging), and Dr. John Neuhaus (a biostatistician with expertise in multivariate analyses).  The proposed research investigates the effect of pre-morbid, individual characteristics related to language disabilities and clinical presentation in neurodegenerative diseases. The central hypothesis is that neurodevelopmental factors are associated with increased vulnerability of the language networks to disease, leading to specific language presentations, imaging changes, and disease progression. We will study PPA and FTD gene carriers to examine the consequences of language learning disability and hand preference on clinical, cognitive, and neuroimaging phenotype. We will collect a standardized neurodevelopmental history, detailed cognitive assessment, and imaging data to determine phenotypic differences between PPA patients with and without a history of language-learning disabilities at presentation (Aim 1). We will establish hand preference and language lateralization patterns using magnetoencephalography in PPA and healthy control subjects and correlate them with measures of structural brain symmetry (Aim 2). We will collect longitudinal cognitive and neuroimaging data on PPA and FTD gene carriers and compare patterns of progression in subjects with and without language learning disabilities (Aim 3). This research will increase understanding of pre-morbid factors on clinical heterogeneity in PPA, direct future studies into early diagnostic and treatment strategies, and offer novel neurodevelopmental and imaging measures as new tools for PPA characterization and diagnosis. This K23 training will enable Dr. Miller to apply concepts of selective neurodevelopmental vulnerability to the understanding of other neurodegenerative diseases.]"
"9282179","Project Summary As life expectancy increases, questions arise about the quality of the additional years of life. Data consistently shows a Hispanic mortality advantage, especially among older adults. However, despite comparatively longer life expectancy, Hispanic elders are also at high risk of disease and disability. Therefore, the first goal of the proposed research is to analyze two NIH-funded datasets to identify changes in healthy life expectancy among very old Mexican-Americans as compared to otherwise similar non- Hispanic whites. Increases in proportion of life spent without disability would be evidence of compression of morbidity, whereas decreases in proportion of life spent without disability would be evidence of expansion of morbidity. Studies show that morbidity and disability trajectories (and hence healthy life expectancy) differs significantly across sub-populations (e.g. immigrants) and are also influenced by the neighborhood context. Therefore, the second aim of this study is to do sub-group analyses. This includes analyses by specific diseases, by demographic and SES groups, and by neighborhood variables. These goals will be accomplished using data on Mexican American elders from the Hispanic Established Populations for the Epidemiologic Study of the Elderly (H-EPESE). Non-Hispanic white elders will be sampled from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) as the comparison group. Sullivan method will be used to calculate the life expectancy of each cross-sectional cohort, and multi-level modeling will be used to determine the relative influence of individual and neighborhood level characteristics. Results from the data would allow for measurement of population health over time for a growing and vulnerable population of elders. At the same time, results would allow for targeted interventions at both individual as well as neighborhood level variables. Understanding trends in healthy life expectancy is particularly important in a country with an already overburdened health services system5 since interventions that are targeted at particularly vulnerable groups may be more effective than those aimed at the general population34."
"9439594","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Skeletal muscles are a diverse family of highly specialized tissues that perform a wide array of physiological functions. These muscles originate from different developmental origins and have characteristic, specialized morphologies. Unsurprisingly, many disorders of skeletal muscle afflict a remarkably specific subset of tissues. Taken as a whole, these observations indicate that specific genetic programs establish and maintain physiological specialization of muscle tissues. Elucidating these genetic programs is essential to support research into the causes, treatment, and prevention of musculoskeletal diseases. Nevertheless, most gene expression studies performed to-date have not directly addressed intrinsic variability among different muscle tissues. To better understand the intrinsic differences between muscle tissues, our long term goal is to build a comprehensive, publicly-available gene expression atlas. Our strategy is to use RNA-sequencing to profile the expression of mRNA and small non-coding RNAs in mouse muscle tissues. We will exploit the single-base resolution of RNA-sequencing data to study post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, such as alternative splicing and alternative polyadenylation. This proposal will thereby define transcriptional diversity within representative muscle tissues and make this resource available to the research and clinical community. These data will be a key reference for future studies of gene expression changes in disease, injury, and aging. Moreover, successful completion of this proposal will enable discovery-based approaches to identify and eventually manipulate tissue-specific factors that determine whether a given muscle group is susceptible to injury and disease."
"9276325","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Environmental exposures such as maternal adiposity mark the placental epigenome which modulates placental function. Pregnancies in obese mothers generate an adverse intrauterine environment, via their inflammatory milieu and metabolic derangements that programs the offspring in a sexually dimorphic manner for obesity, diabetes and metabolic disease in adult life. Understanding the role of the intrauterine environment on epigenetic regulation of placental function is needed to prevent the intergenerational transmission of disease.  Epigenetic information is conveyed via the interaction of mitotically heritable patterns of DNA methylation and chromatin structure. Using a genome-scale DNA methylation array we find 18 genes with significantly increased methylation, and 3 genes with significantly decreased methylation, in the region from - 100 to +100bp of their transcription start sites in placentas of obese compared to normal body weight women. One gene with increased methylation encodes for ten eleven translocation 3 (TET3), a member of a ketoglutarate and iron-dependent dioxygenase enzyme superfamily, that converts 5-methylcytosine (5mC) to 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5hmC), and can be regulated by the metabolic environment. 5mC and 5hmC may epigenetically control expression of distinct sets of genes. Increased placental TET3 promoter methylation may decrease TET3 expression, reduce demethylation activity and be linked to the overall increase in promoter methylation with obesity.  We will test two hypotheses: a. increasing maternal adiposity during pregnancy increases global DNA methylation, the balance of methylation to hydroxymethylation at certain gene promoters and alters the transcriptional profile in placenta and b. TET3 expression can be epigenetically regulated in the placenta by hypoxic, inflammatory, redox or metabolic stress.  The impact of this highly innovative study will be the effect on overall population health of our increased knowledge of the epigenetic regulation of placental function by maternal adiposity, its relationship to the developmental programming of obesity and metabolic syndrome and the therapeutic opportunities revealed."

"9319010","SUMMARY One of the primary goals of genetics is to understand how and why naturally varying individuals differ in phenotype. Mapping the molecular basis of this trait variation can be straightforward, but only in individuals that can be interbred. We have found that a little-studied worm species, Caenorhabditis latens, has a median lifespan 50% longer than related nematodes, and we have observed robust, conserved thermotolerance in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the only species of its clade that can act as an opportunistic pathogen. In the current proposal, we dissect these species divergences using a massively parallel version of the reciprocal hemizygote test. We create a genomic complement of hemizygote mutants, by generating viable, sterile F1 hybrids between species and subjecting them to transposon mutagenesis. We pool the hemizygotes, measure their longevity and fitness in sequencing-based assays, and test for differences in frequency between clones of the pool bearing the two parents' alleles of a given gene. The result is a catalog of loci at which variants between species influence the trait of interest. In our proof of principle using yeast (Aim 1) and worm (Aim 2), we will uncover alleles that have arisen in wild species to boost healthspan and stress resistance. These results will stand in contrast to the alleles weakening fitness that are often mapped in intra-specific studies. Orthologs of our yeast loci will be of immediate interest as candidates for virulence genes in prevalent fungal pathogens, and orthologs of our worm lifespan factors will be well-suited to analysis for anti-aging effects in mammals. This effort will be the first-ever comprehensive survey of the genetic architecture and molecular genetics of trait variation between reproductively isolated individuals. And the methods we pioneer will enable genetic dissection in any eukaryotic system in which banks of F1 hybrid individuals or their tissues are available."
"9270097","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): HIV remains a major public health concern in Georgia given the potential for developing into a widespread epidemic. In order to contain it, the country should have adequate capacity to obtain quality research evidence to better understand key drivers of HIV epidemic as well as identify bottlenecks in existing services, policies, and programs, to prepare a strong basis for improving national response to HIV/AIDS. The main objective of the proposed planning grant (Planning Grant for Fogarty HIV Research Training Program for Low-and-Middle-Income Country Institutions [D71], PAR-13-214), as defined by the applicant organization Partnership for Research and Action for Health - a strategic partner of Tbilisi State Medical University (TSMU) International School of Public Health (ISPH), in collaboration with the University at Albany/State University of New York School of Public Health (SUNY/Albany-SPH), the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center (SUNY-DMC), The New York State Department of Health's (NYSDOH) AIDS Institute, is to support development of doctoral level HIV research training opportunities at TSMU-ISPH, Georgia. The scientific topics for the proposed HIV research training include epidemiologic, behavioral, social, implementation, operations, health services, and health systems research across HIV prevention, treatment and care. These proposed topics and target groups were selected based on careful analysis of existing data, including the major gaps that exist in our understanding of the challenges faced by these key affected populations when accessing prevention and care and treatment services. The proposed scientific topics align fully with UNAIDS's key recommendations to government officials and policy makers on the investments needed to end the global AIDS epidemic over the coming decades. The program's proposed scientific topics also align fully with the priorities laid out in New York State's Plan to End the AIDS Epidemic. This alignment of priorities, as well as the underlying similarities in the concentrated epidemics in the Republic of Georgia and in New York State, creates a unique opportunity to incorporate a meaningful experiential learning component as part of the proposed training program. This planning effort is an excellent extension of the long and fruitful association between TSMU- ISPH, SUNY/Albany-SPH and SUNY-DMC, within the framework of Fogarty funded AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP) training grant that has been active in Georgia since 1996. Namely, AITRP project has supported MPH level training in epidemiology and biostatistics for many of TSMU-ISPH faculty and students, with major focus on epidemiology of HIV/AIDS. It is believed that the proposed planning grant will prepare a basis for successful application to full Fogarty HIV Research Training Program (D43, PAR-13-126), through which the support will be provided to TSMU-ISPH in the design and implementation of two doctoral programs: (1) Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Program in Epidemiology, and (2) Doctoral of Public Health (DrPH) Program in Health Policy, Management and Behavior. The program implementation will be guided by a special Technical Advisory Group (TAG) consisting of Program Faculty representing TSMU-ISPH, SUNY/Albany-SPH, SUNY-DMC and the NYSDOH AIDS Institute. The major activities under this planning grant include needs assessment/formative research and two one-week workshops, to be organized in Georgia and attended by US and Georgian program faculty members."
"9221914","Project Summary Alcohol use disorders and social anxiety disorder are highly comorbid and associated with significant impairment. Social anxiety comorbidity is associated with poorer addiction treatment engagement and outcomes. Thus, addressing underlying social anxiety symptoms that may lead to and maintain alcohol problems, as well as undermine successful treatment for alcohol use disorders, is warranted. This proposal aims to develop and evaluate a fully integrated outpatient program for comorbid social anxiety and alcohol use disorders that weaves evidence-based treatment for social anxiety disorder (i.e., exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy) into a traditional, evidence-based treatment for alcohol use disorders. First, we will develop the protocol for the fully integrated treatment (FIT). The overarching goal of FIT will be to simultaneously deliver alcohol use disorder treatment and social anxiety disorder treatment. Development will be an iterative process guided by previous research (including our own), and by input from clinicians, administrators, and patients in an outpatient substance use disorder treatment clinic. After the protocol is developed, we will use our established clinician training procedures to train clinicians at our community partnered clinic to competently deliver the intervention. After protocol development and clinician training, we will conduct a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) comparing the efficacy of our fully integrated treatment (FIT) for comorbid alcohol use and social anxiety disorders to usual care (UC) in the community substance use disorder specialty clinic. The goals of the RCT will be to gather data regarding acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy of the FIT protocol. We will randomize treatment-seeking participants (N = 60) who have comorbid social anxiety and alcohol use disorders. We will assess treatment engagement, social anxiety outcomes, and alcohol use outcomes at baseline, 3-months, and 6-months from baseline. We will also gather qualitative and quantitative acceptability data from patients after completing FIT, which may guide final refinements of FIT prior to testing in a larger-scale grant. The knowledge gained from this investigation has the potential to significantly improve the treatment of alcohol use disorders and make a significant public health impact. The focus on direct translation to community practice paradigms and the emphasis on full mental health and addiction treatment integration significantly advance the field."
"9268547","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a personal and societal tragedy that demands an accelerated effort to develop effective therapies. Strong genetic evidence links the amyloid precursor protein (APP) and its proteolytic derivatives to AD. A leading hypothesis proposes that a small amphipathic fragment of APP, amyloid b-protein (Ab), self-associates to form assemblies loosely referred to as oligomers, and that these trigger a complex pathogenic sequence of events that culminate in dementia. However, the toxic forms of Ab in human brain, and their relationship to disease have not been rigorously studied. Given the unsustainable burden that AD is placing on healthcare systems worldwide, it is essential that scientific doubts about the role of Ab and how it is best targeted are dealt with directly and swiftly. More than a decade ago, we and others proposed that certain non-monomeric, non-fibrillar forms of Ab are potent neurotoxins and may be the precipitating agent in AD. Yet the precise biochemical identity of these toxic oligomers remains unclear. Moreover, while the vast bulk of studies of Ab structure and activity have used synthetic Ab peptides, it is now apparent that brain-derived Ab preparations are much more damaging to neurons and much better seeds for amyloidogenesis than are Ab assemblies formed in vitro. We hypothesize that the enhanced toxic activity of brain-derived oligomers is related to the presence of mixtures of different Ab sequences, post-translational modifications and/or formation of covalent cross-links, all of which act to increase the stability of toxic assemblies. s appears to be true in prion diseases, we predict that the size, conformation and stability of Ab assemblies strongly influence their toxic activity. Using aqueous extracts of AD brains, and based on substantial preliminary data, we propose to investigate rigorously: (i) the assembly size, (ii) conformations and (iii) dynamic nature of toxic Ab species. Then we propose to purify them to homogeneity and to elucidate their composition. Throughout our experiments, we will constantly link our physical analyses with measures of neurobiological activity directly relevant to AD. Thereafter, we will analyze postmortem tissue to compare the quantity and quality of toxic oligomers in brains of demented subjects vs. cognitively normal humans with high plaque burdens. Using the same human tissues, we will also measure the levels of other APP fragments to see if any of these better relate to disease than does Ab. Then we will examine brain tissue and plasma from AD patients that received the AN1792 vaccination. The goal of this particular experiment is to ascertain how vaccination affects the levels and forms of Ab in the human brain and whether some immunized patients develop antibodies capable of targeting the toxic oligomers. Finally, from a selection of 20 candidate antibodies in hand, we will identify one that preferentially recognizes toxic oligomers. Then we expect to learn whether it can protect against Ab species in AD mouse models better than does the current lead therapeutic antibody, mAb266."
"9275395","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is an important health concern for veterans, due to its high incidence and frequent poor response to treatment. Notably, internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutations of the fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) receptor tyrosine kinase genes are present AML cells in a third of AML patients and are associated with rapid relapse following chemotherapy. FLT3 inhibitors have activity, but responses are limited and transient.  Pim-1 kinase is a serine threonine kinase that is expressed in AML cells and is overexpressed downstream of FLT3-ITD in AML cells with this molecular abnormality. Pim-1 kinase regulates diverse proteins involved in proliferation, cell cycle, apoptosis and drug resistance, including, among others, c-MYC, the pro-apoptotic protein Bad and the anti-apoptotic protein Mcl-1, and is also implicated in DNA repair. We demonstrated that Pim-1 also phosphorylates FLT3 and promotes its aberrant signaling in a positive feedback loop in FLT3-ITD AML cells, and that Pym kinase inhibitors sensitize FLT3-ITD AML cells to apoptosis induction by FLT3 inhibitors. We then found that Pim kinase inhibitors also sensitize FLT3-ITD AML cells to apoptosis induction by chemotherapy drugs used to treat AML. Pim-1 substrate proteins are also expressed in key pathways in AML stem cells, and Pim-1 phosphorylation of these proteins may protect AML stem cells from the effects of chemotherapy and of FLT3 inhibitors. Pim kinase inhibitors are in current preclinical and clinical development.  1. The overall hypotheses of this grant proposal is that Pim-1 plays a key role in resistance of FLT3-ITD AML to available treatments, and that inhibition of Pim kinase will improve treatment outcomes in FLT3-ITD AML by abrogating multiple mechanisms of drug resistance and of disease progression. The Specific Aims of the proposed work are: 1. To determine the mechanisms by which Pim kinase inhibition sensitizes FLT3-ITD AML cells to induction of apoptosis by chemotherapy drugs and by FLT3 inhibitors; 2. To optimize scheduling of administration of Pim kinase inhibitors, chemotherapy drugs and by FLT3 inhibitors in FLT3-ITD AML; and 3. To test the effects of in vivo administration of Pim kinase inhibitors with chemotherapy drugs and with FLT3 inhibitors on FLT3-ITD AML cells and AML stem cells and on normal hematopoietic cells.  The effects of Pim-1 kinase inhibition will be studied in AML cell lines and patient samples using both in vitro culture systems and an in vivo model. In Aim 1, we will test the hypotheses that Pim kinase inhibition sensitizes FLT3-ITD cells to apoptosis by inhibiting FLT3-ITD signaling, altering expression and activation of pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins, promoting generation of reactive oxygen species and/or inhibiting repair of DNA damage. Mechanistic insights achieved in Aim 1 will guide design of scheduling of Pim kinase inhibition in relation to exposure to chemotherapy drugs and to FLT3 inhibitors. Approaches to scheduling will be tested in vitro, with apoptosis as the readout. In addition, effects of Pim kinase inhibition on cell cycle could result in kinetic resistance to drugs, and notably cytarabine, and will be tested. Finally, effects on normal hematopoietic cells will be studied to establish a therapeutic index. In Aim 3, strategies optimized in vitro in Aim 2 will be tested in vivo an immunodeficient mouse model. It is anticipated that the proposed work will lead to development and optimization of regimens incorporating Pim kinase inhibitors in the treatment of FLT3-ITD AML, with the goal of improved outcomes in this unfavorable AML subset..."
"9313495","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Our society faces significant challenges in providing quality health care that is accessible by each person and is sensitive to each person's individual lifestyle and individual health needs. Due to recent advances in sensing technologies that have improved in accuracy, increased in throughput, and reduced in cost, it has become relatively easy to gather high resolution behavioral and individualized health data at scale. The resulting big datasets can be analyzed to understand the link between behavior and health and to design healthy behavior interventions. In this emerging area, however, very few courses are currently available for teaching researchers and practitioners about the foundational principles and best practices behind collecting, storing, analyzing, and using behavior- based sensor data. Teaching these skills can help the next generation of students thrive in the increasingly digital world.  The goal of this application is to design online courses that train researchers and practitioners in sensor-based behavioral health. Specifically, we will offer training in responsible conduct, collection and understanding of behavioral sensor data, data exploration and statistical inference, scaling behavioral analysis to massive datasets, and introducing state of the art machine learning and activity learning techniques. The courses will be offered in person to WSU faculty and staff, offered with staff support through MOOCs, and available to the general public from our web page. Course material will be enhanced and driven by specific clinical case studies. Additionally, the courses will be supplemented with actual datasets that students can continue to use beyond the course.  This contribution is significant because not only large research groups but even individual investigators can create large data sets that provide valuable, in-the-moment information about human behavior. They need to be able to handle the challenges that arise when working with sensor- based behavior data. Because students will receive hands-on training with actual sensor datasets and analysis tools, they will know how to get the best results from available tools and will be able to interpret the significance of analysis results.  Our proposed online course program, called AHA!, builds on the investigators' extensive experience and ongoing collaboration at Washington State University on the development of smart home and mobile health app design, activity recognition, scalable biological data mining, and the use of these technologies for clinical applications. Our approach will be to design online course modules to train individuals in the analysis of behavior-based sensor data using clinical case studies (Aim 1). We will design an educational program that involves students from diverse backgrounds and that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (Aim 2). Finally, we will conduct a thorough evaluation to monitor success and incrementally improve the program (Aim 3). All of the materials will be designed for continued use beyond the funding period of the program."

"9275452","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Head trauma is a risk factor for both Alzheimer disease (AD) and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE), a progressive neurodegenerative disease that occurs as a consequence of repetitive mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). CTE causes personality and behavioral changes, executive dysfunction, and memory loss and is characterized by the accumulation of phosphorylated tau protein in the brain. We have shown that CTE can develop following a single explosive blast injury. Thus, veterans are at particular risk for developing CTE as well as AD. Presently, CTE can only be diagnosed at autopsy and there are no known clinical biomarkers. We propose a translational approach to systematically address neurodegeneration in the largest neuropathologically-confirmed autopsy cohort of CTE and CTE with AD (CTE-AD) patients in the world on the protein, DNA, and RNA levels, with the goal of identifying biomarkers, genetic risk factors, and mechanisms that can be targeted for drug discovery. We hypothesize that head trauma leads to the pathologies of AD and CTE through independent mechanisms involving different tau haplotypes and isoforms. Because head trauma and the resulting early pathology of CTE can affect different regions of the brain, we will correlate histological, biochemical, and genetic measures with a tissue microarray demonstrating affected and non-affected regions in human brain. We will use plate-based ELISA to quantitate levels of A? (1-40, 1-42, oligomeric) and tau (total and phosphorylated). In addition, we will determine the apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotypes and tau haplotypes of our subjects and correlate with clinical and pathological measures. Our preliminary data demonstrate that the APOE ?4 allele and H1 tau haplotype are enriched in subjects with CTE and suggests that tau isoform expression differs between CTE and AD. Thus, genomic variation in APOE and MAPT may predict risk for developing trauma-induced neurodegenerations. Furthermore, we will recruit 105 subjects with AD and with and without a history of mTBI as well as controls to measure tau and A? biomarkers in the CSF. We expect that trauma will exacerbate the changes seen in AD, leading to greater tau and less A?. Our preliminary data shows that tau and A? levels in CSF can be used to discriminate subjects with CTE and A? plaques from subjects with AD or FTLD.  Overall, we propose a two-pronged approach of 1) uncovering the progression of AD pathologies in subjects with repetitive mTBI and the mechanisms involved in CTE and AD tauopathy and 2) discovering genetic risk factors and biomarkers based on these pathologies in living subjects. A basic understanding of the mechanisms underlying the neuropathology of mTBI will facilitate rational drug design; and the development of reliable biomarkers to detect the long-term effects of mTBI will enable the diagnosis and monitoring of CTE and CTE-AD during life and will be crucial for assessing the efficacy of potential therapies as they are developed."
"9480905","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Protein aggregation is a feature of most neurodegenerative diseases, including the transthyretin (TTR) amyloidoses. TTR is a tetrameric protein secreted into the blood by the liver. Compelling evidence suggests that peripheral neurodegeneration in the TTR amyloidoses results from rate- limiting TTR tetramer dissociation, aberrant monomer misfolding and misfolded TTR assembly into a spectrum of TTR aggregate structures. Extracellular aggregation leads to proteotoxicity in tissues not synthesizing TTR by a cell non-autonomous process that we seek to understand via the proposed experiments, and which is not understood for any aggregation-associated neurodegenerative disease. In humans, WT TTR aggregation leads to a cardiomyopathy, whereas aggregation of other TTR mutations leads to a primary neuropathy. Herein, we report the development and partial characterization of transgenic Caenorhabditis elegans models of the TTR amyloidoses, exhibiting TTR aggregation and three cell non-autonomous quantifiable neuronal TTR proteotoxicity-associated cellular and sub-cellular phenotypes with direct relevance to human disease. We will characterize TTR mRNA levels and TTR conformations including tetramers, and misfolded TTR oligomers in these models as a function of aging and correlate these with the neuronal phenotypes observed. Defects in microtubule-based trafficking appear to be a centrally important mechanistic feature of TTR proteotoxicity. The availability of novel small molecule and genetic tools to quantify TTR conformation, as well as the ability to image sub-cellular phenotypes in a single neuron as a function of aging in the same living worm to quantify phenotypic changes affords us an extraordinary opportunity to understand the cell biology and biochemistry of neurodegeneration. Access to the drug tafamidis, which dramatically slows progression of the TTR amyloidoses in humans will also allow us to discern how inhibition of TTR aggregation alters the cell biological and biochemical defects apparently underlying neurodegeneration in these models. To further understand the mechanisms of TTR proteotoxicity at the cellular and molecular level, we will search for modulators of TTR proteotoxicity by identifying suppressors of a locomotion defect exhibited by one of our TTR models in a unbiased forward genetic screen. We have identified candidate suppressors in a pilot screen and showed that some exhibited proper TTR synthesis and secretion, suggesting that this screen could identify tissue specific molecular targets that are relays between the formation of extracellular TTR aggregates and cellular toxicity. These studies will establish TTR C. elegans models as relevant to the study of cell non-autonomous TTR toxicity."
"9269946","DESCRIPTION: HIV-infected (HIV+) and elderly individuals are the main adult populations for whom pneumococcal vaccine is recommended as they are highly susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus), the leading cause of community acquired and in-hospital pneumonia in the U.S. and globally. In late fall 2012, a 13 valent pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide (PPS) conjugate vaccine (PCV13) recommended for infants/children since 2010 and approved for adults since 2011, was recommended for HIV+ adults. The goal of this project, submitted in response to PAR 12-175 Multidisciplinary studies of HIV/AIDS and Aging, is to determine the effects of aging and HIV infection PCV13 response. In prior work, our group discovered links between B cell and antibody repertoire deficiencies and impaired PPS antibody responses in HIV+ individuals and identified novel functional activities of PPS antibodies that protect against pneumococcal sepsis and pneumonia in mice. Informed by these studies, we will perform in depth analyses of the serological, B cell, functional and molecular responses to PCV13 of middle aged (50-65 yrs) and elderly (>65 yrs) HIV+ and HIV- individuals and assemble the data into serological and molecular signatures of PCV13 response. We will use standard serological and functional assays along with novel assays of PPS antibody functional activity against clinically important pneumococcal serotypes that PCV13 was developed to prevent. Then, we will use systems biology to identify molecular mechanisms of PCV13 response and assemble B cell, serological and transcriptional profiles into biomarkers of response. The specific aims of this project are: 1) To determine the effects of age and HIV infection on the antibody and B cell response to PCV13; 2) To determine the effects of age and HIV infection on PCV13-elicited antibody functional activity; 3) To determine the effects of age and HIV infection on the molecular response to PCV13. As biomarkers of adult pneumococcal vaccine response are not available, those identified in this study will fill a major gap and provid a platform to decipher PCV13 efficacy, a roadmap to guide future vaccine use in elderly HIV+ and HIV- individuals, clues to improve vaccine immunogenicity, and pathways to develop new approaches to prevent pneumococcal disease in those who are most at risk."
"9265768","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Pittsburgh Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (Pitt MACS) Clinical Research Site (CRS) was established in 1983 by Dr. C. Rinaldo, PI, as one of 4 MACS CRS as a prospective cohort study of the natural history of HIV infection and the impact of effective combination antiretroviral therapies (cART) in men who have sex with men (MSM). We will continue to combine genetic, virologic, immunologic and psychosocial approaches and utilize the specimen cryorepository for long-term characterization of Pitt MACS participants. Along with our new satellite clinic site at The Ohio State University (OSU) led by Dr. S. Koletar, we will continue follow-up of the cohort with a dynamic enrollment to enable further elucidation of the biology and response to HIV infection, and distinguishing the effects of age, HIV, evolving cART regimens, genetics, co- infections and behavior use on clinical outcomes and causally-associated biomarkers. This is a transition to a rolling cohort design to replace existing cohort members who die or otherwise are permanently lost to follow-up. The Pitt MACS scientific agenda focuses on clinical epidemiology, pathogenesis, psychosocial factors, and development of novel methods for the study of HIV disease. The Pitt MACS is ideally positioned to address these issues because of long-term standardized follow-up, an extensive repository and an appropriate control group of HIV-uninfected MSM with similar lifestyles, behaviors, and demographics. The Pitt MACS contributes strength and innovation in three areas: (a) studies of viral genomics and host immunopathogenesis including HHV-8/KSHV and HCV coinfections and regulation by host microRNAs, (b) in depth analysis of effects of HIV infection in the brain and lungs including microbiome analysis, and (c) studies of syndemics and resiliencies in aging MSM including effects on depression, substance use and sexual behavior. The Pitt MACS CRS will continue to contribute via the MACS Executive Committee and Working Groups with expertise in all aspects of HIV infection to successfully address our 7 scientific aims that are identical to those in Part A. The Pitt MACS will continue to characterize the long-term, natural and treated history of HIV infection in MSM, provide insight into the clinical epidemiology of HIV, and further our understanding of predictors of disease among HIV positive MSM."

To accomplish these goals, we will establish core resources for human studies; make available biospecimens and biomarker data; provide structural and functional neuroimaging; maintain an administrative structure and consultative resources appropriate for these goals; provide community-based outreach and educational programs and research participation opportunities; support Center-sponsored research projects and pilot projects on these disorders; and support national efforts to understand disease mechanisms and find effective forms of therapy and prevention."
"9374906","Project Summary Many essential proteins are inserted into membranes or secreted. Because they are synthesized in the cytosol, these proteins must cross a lipid bilayer to reach their destination and become functional. The majority of proteins bound for secretion or membrane insertion transits through the universally conserved Sec translocon. The Sec pathway allows proteins destined for export from the cytosol to cross the endoplasmic reticulum membrane in eukaryotes and the plasma membrane in bacteria. The essential role of Sec-dependent translocation in many cellular pathways makes elucidation of the underlying molecular mechanisms an important task. Substrates of the Sec system include virulence factors and antibiotic-inactivating enzymes in bacteria, and range from insulin to antibodies in animals. Perturbations in the Sec-pathway can lead to numerous diseases, including cancer and diabetes. A mechanistic understanding of the translocation process can fuel the development of drugs that target this central cellular pathway. Sec-dependent protein translocation has been studied extensively with biochemical and structural approaches, characterizing many of its components. However, the dynamics of the process are not well understood. During translocation, the translocon channel must allow the polypeptide to move while maintaining a permeability barrier for ions and other solutes. How the channel interacts with polypeptide substrates to achieve these seemingly conflicting requirements is not known. Another key question that has remained unanswered is how the molecular machines that associate with the translocon convert chemical energy into the mechanical work that powers translocation. Many of the important outstanding questions concerning the Sec translocation system could be answered if it were possible to follow the passage of a protein through the channel in real-time with high spatial and temporal resolution, but this capability is not presently available. Single-molecule approaches, enabling observation and manipulation of individual macromolecules, have provided unprecedented insights into biological mechanisms. I propose to investigate the mechanisms of Sec- dependent protein translocation with optical tweezers. This approach enables us to unravel the mechanisms underlying Sec-dependent protein translocation. Our studies will yield new and exciting insights into the mechanisms employed by the translocation machinery to transport proteins out of the cytosol."
"9335221","Project Summary  The proposed randomized, controlled trial will evaluate the effects of an intervention to reduce exposure to medications among hospitalized older adults discharged to skilled nursing facilities (SNFs). This study will be conducted in one university-affiliated hospital and 14 area SNFs to enroll approximately 1,300 total participants across five project years. Patients discharged to SNF represent the largest segment of Medicare beneficiaries discharged to post-acute care services and are a particularly high risk group for loss of independence and other poor clinical outcomes. This investigative team recently completed a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Innovation Award, which provides strong preliminary data related to the prevalence of polypharmacy and the relationship between polypharmacy and geriatric syndromes (e.g., medications associated with falls) in this patient population. Based on these data, we developed a structured deprescribing intervention protocol (?Shed-Meds?) coupled with standardized screening assessments for eight geriatric syndromes to be implemented in the hospital and continued during the SNF stay. The goal of the intervention is to safely deprescribe medications, as defined by dose reductions and stopped medications, based on a combination of clinical criteria and patient preferences. We have pilot-tested our patient-centered intervention in preparation for this proposal with promising results. The proposed trial will evaluate the effects of this intervention on medication exposure, medication adherence, geriatric syndromes, and health status across the care transitions from hospital to SNF to home to include a 90-day follow-up period after SNF discharge. Our overarching hypothesis is that reducing medications for older patients across the continuum of care will favorably impact geriatric syndromes."
"9328955","Compared to traditional DSM personality disorder (PD) diagnostic categories, dimensional representations of PD provide a more comprehensive framework from which to understand and conceptualize maladaptive personality functioning (Clark, 2007; Widiger & Trull, 2007), consistent with the RDoC emphasis on dimensional models relative to traditional DSM syndromes. The five-factor model (FFM) of personality is widely regarded as the leading dimensional model of personality, and is supported by an extensive amount of empirical support spanning over 30 years. The FFM consists of 30 lower-order facet scales (as conceptualized by McCrae and Costa, 2003) from which both high and low levels can be used to describe PD. FFM descriptions of PD have been shown to account for the variance of all ten categorical DSM PD types (Livesley, 2001; Miller, 2012). In addition, personality science has demonstrated that normal range domains and facets of the FFM significantly predict disease and mortality (Dixon-Gordon, Whalen, Layden, & Chapman, 2015; Friedman & Kern, 2014; Smith & Mackenzie, 2006). However, symptoms of personality disorder have even larger associations with health outcomes (Gleason, Weinstein, Balsis, & Oltmanns, 2014). Recently, FFM- based dimensional measures of PD have been developed (Widiger, Lynam, Miller, & Oltmanns, 2012), providing an exciting opportunity to measure PD within the comprehensive framework of the FFM. The present line of research will incorporate this novel analytic and conceptual approach into an ongoing longitudinal study of a representative sample of 1,630 older adults in the St. Louis area. FFM-PD measures of neuroticism, conscientiousness, and extraversion (the Five-Factor Borderline, Obsessive-Compulsive, and Avoidant Inventories, respectively), which are most frequently associated with health (Smith, Williams, & Segerstrom, 2015) will be employed. Structural Equation Modeling will be used to compare the predictive and incremental validity of FFM PD measures with and over DSM PD measures and normal personality measures in the longitudinal prediction of self- and informant-reported general health status, major disease (including cancer, diabetes, and lung and heart disease), biological markers of stress and inflammation (e.g., cortisol, interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-?, and C reactive protein), and mortality. The dimensional FFM PD measurement perspective will provide incremental validity over traditional measures of PD and normal personality measures in the prediction of these both subjective and objective measures of health. Results will be imperative to developing a comprehensive framework for understanding the longitudinal relationship between maladaptive PD traits and risk of physical disease and mortality in older adults. This proposal will provide the PI with the opportunity to unite two cutting-edge personality research laboratories, while advancing knowledge about the relationship between personality and health, and developing research skills and clinical training that will facilitate the goal of conducting and disseminating personality research as an academic professor."
"9174070","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        We have previously proposed, and provide proof for, an approach to help identify blood biomarkers for mood state. Such biomarkers can serve as a basis for objective clinical laboratory tests. We are interested in carrying out similar studies to identify blood biomarkers for psychosis and to address the important scientific and clinical issue of specificity vs. overlap between the biomarkers for these disorders.  There are to date no clinical laboratory blood tests for psychosis Given the complex nature of psychotic disorders, the current reliance on patient self-report of symptoms and the clinician's impression on interview of patient is a rate limiting step in deliverig the best possible care with existing treatment modalities, as well as in developing new and improved treatment approaches, including new medications.  We propose to identify biomarkers using Convergent Functional Genomics (CFG), an approach developed by us over the last decade, which is based on comprehensive integration of gene expression and genetic data, from human and animal model studies. We have provided proof of principle for this approach helping to identify blood biomarkers for mood disorders (Le- Niculescu et al. 2009)1 and more recently for psychosis (Kurian et al. 2011)2. In that latter work, we have identified a series of high probability blood candidate biomarker genes for psychosis that deserve future scrutiny. A predictive score developed based on a panel of seven top candidate biomarkers for hallucinations (a key symptom for psychosis), shows good sensitivity and moderate specificity, in independent patient cohorts. Our preliminary studies suggest that blood biomarkers may offer an unexpectedly informative window into brain functioning and psychosis state.  This exciting preliminary work needs to be carefully extended and replicated in a larger independent cohort, as well as compared to normal controls to derive additional normative data, which is what we propose to do in this project. Moreover, there was overlap between our lists of candidate genes and biomarkers for mood disorders and for psychosis, suggesting that we need to better understand the overlap between bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, and, as a field, explore and refine our integration of nosology with biology. Potential Impact on Veterans Health Care:  The development of clinical laboratory blood tests for psychosis will lead to more targeted treatments for veterans affected by psychiatric disorders involving psychotic symptoms, such as schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder, as well as severe forms of bipolar disorder, depression and PTSD, with improved efficacy and decreased side-effects. This will have an impact on patient health, well-being, safety, quality of life, and independent functioning, as well as decrease hospitalizations and overall health-care costs. Moreover, biomarker profiling may help with assessing response to treatment, risk of relapse, and early intervention efforts to prevent the full-blown development of illness in susceptible individuals."
"9206081","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Tight junctions (TJs) undergo constant homeostatic maintenance. While it is clear that TJ protein internalization and vesicular recycling are essential for this process, the underlying mechanisms are not defined. Studies using non-physiological stimuli have defined the actin cytoskeleton as a critical contributor to TJ assembly and maintenance. Actomyosin contraction, which has been linked to physiologic and pathophysiologic TJ barrier loss, such as that triggered by tumor necrosis factor (TNFa), drives downstream caveolar endocytosis of the TJ protein occludin. Similar processes have been implicated in barrier loss caused by enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) infection. While both forms of barrier loss are reversible, it is not clear if actomyosin relaxation or TJ protein recycling are involved in this process. Further, despite an established role for microtubules in apical protein recycling, few studies have examined the contributions of microtubules to TJ homeostasis and repair. Recently, a specific subset of microtubules, planar apical networks of microtubules, was found to interact with the TJ protein cingulin. This interaction is regulated by AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mediated phosphorylation of cingulin and is essential to epithelial morphogenesis. Our data show that microtubule disruption impedes TJ recovery in calcium switch assays. In addition, the EPEC virulence factor EspG, which disrupts microtubules, attenuates TJ barrier restoration. These findings indicate that microtubules play an unexpected and critical role in TJ homeostasis and repair. However, the mechanisms by which microtubules contribute to these processes have not been explored. The long-term goal of this proposal is to define the molecular and cellular processes involved in the restoration of TJ structure and function and use this knowledge to design therapies to promote epithelial repair. The objective of the proposed studies is to define the role of the actin cytoskeleton and microtubules in TJ recovery from pathophysiologic insults. The central hypothesis is that microfilaments and microtubules actively participate in reestablishing intestinal epithelial TJs after disruption by pathological insults such as inflammation and infection. This research is highly relevant to the VA population as diarrhea among military troops is quite prevalent rendering a substantial portion unfit for duty at any given time and is associated with chronic health sequelae including irritable bowel disease and inflammatory bowel disease. Definition of the events involved in TJ maintenance and restoration will guide the development of strategies to preserve intact TJs and aid in TJ recovery. The central hypothesis will be tested by 3 aims: 1. Define the role of the actin cytoskeleton in TJ recovery following molecularly targeted, inflammatory (TNF) and infectious (EPEC), stimuli; 2. Determine the contribution of microtubules to TJ restoration from inflammatory insults (TNF) and enteric infection (EPEC) in vitro; and 3. Resolve the role of microfilaments and microtubules in TJ recovery from pathophysiologic conditions (TNF and EPEC infection) in vivo."
"9266760","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Michigan PBB Registry was established in order to study the health of thousands of people exposed to brominated flame retardants as a result of the largest agricultural disaster in US history. Previous research by this team has shown significant health effects associated with exposure to polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) including earlier menarche, increased risk of miscarriages and lower estrogen levels among women, and more urogenital problems among men. Over the past few years, Emory researchers have conducted over a dozen community meetings throughout Michigan, collaborated with community partners, shared research findings with the community, responded to community needs, and sought community input for future research plans. This proposed study, collaboratively developed by scientists, community partners, and public health officials, addresses several major concerns expressed by the PBB community. Specifically, affected individuals have expressed interest in a possible treatment to remove PBBs from their bodies, concern about heritable effects from PBB on their children and grandchildren, continuing health concerns beyond those related to reproduction, and frustration that local health-care providers seem unaware of the statewide PBB exposure and/or its possible health effects. To address these concerns, the proposed study has four specific aims. The first is to evaluate the utility of  nutritional supplement, a non-absorbable artificial fat, as a potential means of accelerating the elimination of PBB by conducting a randomized double-blind trial. The second aim will explore the heritability of changes in the epigenome associated with PBB exposure by studying 25 families across three generations. The epigenome of parents, their children, and their grandchildren will be examined to determine if epigenetic patterns associated with direct exposure to PBB of parents are apparent in the children and grandchildren. Aim three will address community concerns regarding additional health effects beyond reproductive outcomes. Participants, including 575 new enrollees, will complete health questionnaires and provide serum samples for analysis to determine if PBB exposure is associated with neurodegenerative diseases, joint pain/disorder, cancer, immune function and liver/pancreatic problems. If any of the self-identified adverse outcomes are associated with PBB exposure, additional funding will be sought to further explore these associations. Finally, the public health action plan will seek t raise environmental health awareness in Michigan. Educational programs will be developed for healthcare providers, policy-makers, and citizens to increase local capacity to address exposure concerns."

"9258483","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is the main cause of stem cell transplant-related mortality after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Regulatory T cells prevent GVHD in preclinical models and early trials. Adoptive transfer of poly-specific Tregs exploits their natural suppressive functions and aims to alter the in vivo balance of T effectors and Tregs. However, this approach may also produce the same broad immunosuppressive effects that are caused by drugs. Experimental rodent models from our lab and others demonstrate that alloantigen-specific Tregs are more effective at preventing GVHD and improving survival than polyspecific Tregs. Our Long-Term Goal is to exploit Tregs to prevent GVHD in humans without suppressing desirable immune responses against infectious pathogens or malignant cells. Given their low frequency in human blood, several groups have explored ex-vivo Treg expansion for therapeutic application and these expanded Tregs retain suppressive activity. In contrast to polyspecific Tregs expanded non-selectively, antigen-specific Tregs produce selective suppression of allo-responses with no effect on third-party responses and facilitate alloantigen-specific tolerance after HSCT and organ grafting in. Before these results find clinical application, early clinical studies are required to address scientific and mechanistic questions and move the field forward. Our central hypothesis is that donor Tregs specific for host alloantigens presented by dendritic cells will prevent GVHD more effectively than current standard immune suppressive drugs, while preserving immunity to viral pathogens and cancer-associated antigens. The objective of this application is to conduct a first-in-human Phase I adoptive immunotherapy trial of allo-specific Tregs for GVHD prevention after HLA- identical sibling HSCT. Important to the potential application of Tregs to human HSCT, is the development of an immune suppressive platform containing rapamycin that selectively permits survival, expansion and suppressive function of Tregs while inhibiting other effector T cells. By trace-labeling the Tregs, we will also assess Treg repopulation and survival after adoptive transfer to allograft recipients."
"9352655","Co-occurrence of seizures with Alzheimer's disease dramatically alters prognosis, and speeds cognitive de- cline. Even mild seizures that may go undetected by caregivers can increase Alzheimer's disease pathogene- sis and also independently lead to neurodegeneration and cognitive dysfunction. Subclinical (non-scorbutic) vitamin C (ascorbate) deficiency is widespread in the USA, particularly among the elderly, and veteran popula- tions where smoking and oxidative stress-related diseases such as atherosclerosis and diabetes are common. A critical, but understudied, mechanism of neuronal protection during excitatory signaling is the glutamate up- take-ascorbate release exchange in astrocytes. As glutamate is taken up into perisynaptic astrocytes via GLT- 1, ascorbate is released into the extracellular fluid providing acute protection against oxidative damage. If GLT- 1 transporter function is compromised by oxidative damage, or if insufficient ascorbate is available for release, then this protection is diminished and the neurotoxic effects of prolonged glutamate exposure are magnified. Recent data support the role of ascorbate treatments in mitigating the effects of seizures, but previous re- search has been critically limited by the use of rodent models that synthesize ascorbate and thus cannot be- come deficient. Decreased brain ascorbate, at levels relevant to human deficiency, is achieved in mice by ge- netic modification of the ability to synthesize ascorbate in liver (Gulo-/-) combined with differential ascorbate supplementation. These mice can also be crossed with the APP/PSEN1 mouse model of Alzheimer's disease to model dietary insufficiency in combination with a disease in which co-occurrence of seizures is common. Specific Aim 1) Demonstrate the role of ascorbate in supporting glutamate clearance by cultured astrocytes. Using cultured astrocytes from both mice and humans we will investigate how conditions that alter the oxida- tive balance of the culture media (e.g. ascorbate and ?-amyloid) determine the properties of GLT-1 in gluta- mate uptake. We will also test how altered glutamate clearance under these situations impacts neuronal sur- vival using co-culture techniques and measuring survival and dendritic branching of primary cultured neurons following exposure to glutamate. These experiments will provide direct support for the importance of the gluta- mate-ascorbate exchange mechanism in supporting neuronal health and protecting against glutamate toxicity. Specific Aim 2) Determine relationship between low brain ascorbate conditions and susceptibility to spontane- ous and pharmacologically-induced seizures. We will record neuronal hyper excitability and measure seizure events through electroencephalography (EEG) under baseline conditions and following seizure induction using kainic acid. Such studies have not previously been conducted in low ascorbate conditions owing to lack of widespread access to appropriate models. We will use an implantable telemetry (wireless) system that allows long-term measuring of EEG in animals within their home cages. This is a significant advance on more tradi- tional `tethered' EEG systems. We will also determine the extent to which repeated exposures to glutamatergic agonists, even without a clear behavioral (seizure) correlate, can negatively impact both cognitive ability, and ?-amyloid production in the APP/PSEN1 mice to explore the functional outcome of seizures in an Alzheimer's disease model in addition to wild-type and Gulo-/- mice. Specific Aim 3) Establish the extent to which upregulation of GLT-1 improves glutamate clearance and de- creases detrimental effects of kainic acid treatments. GLT-1, and therefore glutamate clearance, represents a targetable strategy to reduce the extent of neural damage following hyperexcitability, or seizure events. We will investigate a compound, ceftriaxone, known to up-regulate GLT-1 expression, and assess its ability to de- crease seizure susceptibility and severity. Our long-term goal is to show that protecting glutamate uptake and avoiding ascorbate deficiency can minimize effects of seizure in specific populations, and provide a cheap pre- ventative strategy against cognitive decline."

"9275381","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Autophagy, an evolutionarily conserved intracellular lysosomal degradative pathway, is constitutively active in the myocardium, and removes damaged organelles and proteins to ensure cardiomyocyte survival. Rapid upregulation of autophagy is essential for maintaining cardiomyocyte viability under stress, such as during starvation and ischemia, by generating nutrients as a source of energy and removing potentially deleterious proteins and organelles. Autophagy is also critical for removal of abnormal desmin aggregates that cause cardiomyopathy with the R120G mutation in chaperone protein, B crystallin. It is therefore paradoxical that an upregulation of autophagy has been implicated in causing cardiomyocyte death in reperfusion injury, following an ischemic insult. With reperfusion, we have observed an impairment in autophagosome processing, triggered by a burst in reactive oxygen species generation, as a cause of autophagosome accumulation; which implies that flux through autophagy is impaired with ischemia-reperfusion injury. Indeed, we have demonstrated that autophagosome formation is induced in cardiomyocytes by expression of BNIP3, a pro-death protein that is transcriptionally induced by hypoxia and mediates cardiomyocyte death in ischemia- reperfusion injury; but autophagosome processing is impaired as the autophagy-lysosome machinery gets overwhelmed and autophagosomes enclosing damaged mitochondria accumulate. Exogenous expression of transcription factor EB (TFEB), a master regulator of autophagy-lysosome pathway biogenesis, re-established autophagosome processing, with removal of BNIP3-damaged mitochondria and attenuated cardiomyocyte death. We have also observed that starvation, a potent inducer of cardiomyocyte autophagy, provokes transcriptional upregulation of multiple components of the autophagy-lysosome machinery in the mouse heart; and repetitive starvation by intermittently fasting (depriving mice of food for 24 hours every othe day for 6 weeks) results in protection against ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury, with >50% reduction in infarct size as compared with ad-lib fed mice. This is associated with a rapid fasting-induced nuclear translocation of TFEB from the cytoplasm, suggesting that adequate priming of the autophagy-lysosome machinery by TFEB promotes sufficient autophagy, which is then beneficial in the setting of ischemia-reperfusion injury. In this proposal, we will test the hypothesis that intermittent fasting and exogenous expression of TFEB protect against ischemia-reperfusion induced cardiomyocyte death and protein-aggregate-induced cardiomyopathy and heart failure, by enhancing beneficial autophagy. In specific aim 1, studies will be performed to determine the role of autophagy in intermittent fasting-induced cardioprotection against post-infarction remodeling, by subjecting mice deficient for LAMP2, (which are also autophagy-deficient as LAMP2 is critical for autophagosome-lysosome fusion) to IR injury followed by serial echocardiography and terminal invasive pressure-volume loop studies, to assess changes in left ventricular size and function and development of heart failure, as a function of LAMP2 expression. In specific aim 2, mice with conditional adult onset cardiomyocyte specific overexpression of TFEB will be subjected to IR injury to determine whether exogenous TFEB confers protection against cell death, post-infarction remodeling and heart failure, by enhancing autophagy. In specific aim 3, mice with cardiomyocyte-specific expression of mutant crystallin will be subjected to intermittent fasting or crossed with TFEB overexpressors, to determine whether induction of autophagy prevents protein- aggregate induced heart failure. These studies will evaluate the paradigm that transcriptional induction of autophagy-lysosome machinery enhances stress-induced autophagy, and protects against cardiomyocyte death and heart failure in ischemia-reperfusion injury and desmin-induced cardiomyopathy."
"9271979","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The placenta transports all of the building blocks required for fetal development. In particular, the placenta selectively transfers vital long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) to support the developing human brain and cardiovascular system. Adequate abundance of these specific fatty acids is crucial for normal development. Fetal deficiencies of LCPUFA are associated with compromised cardiovascular health, lower Intelligence Quotients (IQ), and behavioral and cognitive disorders that persist for life. Since the fetus has a negligible capacity to make LCPUFA, the main source is from the maternal circulation; a fetal deficiency of LCPUFA can arise from inadequate maternal levels or dysfunctional placental transport. In gestational diabetes, the mother's blood content of LCPUFA is normal but the placenta transfers significantly less LCPUFA, leading to subnormal levels in the fetus. The consequences of this are significant and these offspring display cognitive impairments and symptoms in accordance with LCPUFA deficiency. The mechanisms that underlie the dysregulation of LCPUFA transport in these placentas are poorly understood, especially in light of the fact that lipid transport even in normal pregnancies has been understudied. The goal of this project is to determine how the human placenta transports LCPUFA, first as it occurs in normal pregnancy and then to apply the knowledge gleaned to explain how this process is dysfunctional in mothers who have gestational diabetes. The process of LCPUFA transport has remained elusive because a method to track LCPUFA in real-time in the human placental tissue has not previously existed. This project proposes to live-track fluorescently tagged LCPUFA in human term placenta explants using state-of-the-art microscopy to identify the cellular mechanisms that underlie maternal-fetal LCPUFA transfer. It will first examine this process in placentas from normal, uncomplicated pregnancies. It will additionally examine how LCPUFA handling differs in placentas from mothers who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes. This study can lead to further investigations of potential biomarkers to evaluate dysfunctional placental LCPUFA transfer in vivo and may also help identify targets for strategizing molecular or nutritional interventions to support normal placenta LCPUFA transfer in pregnancies complicated by metabolic disease."
"9308121","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT  Central insights gained from the first cycle of AG041851 were that the combination of elevated amyloidosis and neurodegeneration greatly increased risk of clinical progression among both clinical normal and mildly impaired persons; and, a novel finding was the definition of an abnormal biomarker category characterized by positive neurodegeneration/neuronal injury biomarkers in the absence of amyloid. We labeled this category suspected non-Alzheimers pathophysiology (SNAP) on the assumption that it represented common non-AD pathologies - e.g., cerebrovascular disease, Lewy body disease, etc. Two modern diagnostic classification systems exist for Alzheimers disease (AD); the National Institute on Aging-Alzheimers Association (NIA-AA) and the International Working Group (IWG). SNAP is not addressed by either of these criteria, yet roughly ¼ of elderly clinically normal (CN) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) persons fall into this category. In addition, neither the NIA-AA nor the IWG criteria include tau PET for classification. We recently led a large international group of senior investigators in proposing a new, descriptive classification scheme for AD biomarkers (Appendix). The seven most widely regarded AD biomarkers are used to create a 3-class biomarker classification scheme called the ATN system. In the ATN system, amyloid biomarkers are amyloid PET and CSF A?42 (denoted by A); tau biomarkers are tau PET and CSF p tau (denoted by T); and, neurodegeneration/neuronal injury biomarkers are FDG PET, anatomic MRI, and CSF t tau (denoted by N). Individuals are classified as positive or negative in each of the three categories leading to eight possible biomarker states (e.g., A-T-N-, A+T+N-, etc.). Neither the NIA-AA nor the IWG criteria categorize individuals in this way and neither addresses the implications of the eight different ATN biomarker permutations.  The aims of this renewal grant will focus on understanding the implications of categorizing individuals into these eight ATN classes. We will use amyloid PET to define A, tau PET to define T, and MRI cortical thickness to define N. Given the current emphasis on individuals who are clinically asymptomatic or have very early signs of cognitive impairment, we will concentrate on individuals who are CN and MCI at baseline. Our aims are:  Aim 1: To create fully imaged population-based cohorts of CN and MCI individuals aged 30?90 with baseline amyloid PET, tau PET, and MRI studies who will be followed clinically with visits every 15 months.  Aim 2: To determine how clinical and demographic characteristics (e.g., age, sex, APOE, indicators of cerebrovascular disease, and baseline cognitive performance) vary across the eight ATN biomarker states.  Aim 3: To estimate the age and sex specific prevalence rates of the eight ATN biomarker states.  Aim 4: To determine the associations between the eight ATN biomarker states and cognitive or clinical outcomes and whether covariates (e.g., age, sex, APOE, and cerebrovascular disease) modify rates of cognitive decline."
"9275318","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Project Summary Microvesicles are submicron size, membrane enclosed fragments, released from cells in response to activation or during apoptosis. Platelet-derived microvesicles, released upon platelet activation, constitute a major fraction of microvesicles in the circulating blood. In addition to their well-known role in hemostasis, platelet microvesicles have been shown to stimulate hematopoietic cells, transfer platelet-specific receptors to the surface of other cells and elicit cytokine responses from synovial fibroblasts. In flowing blood, microvesicles are pushed towards the plasma-endothelial interface because of their size and they are poised to interact with endothelium. Interactions between platelets and endothelium have been known for a long time. Severe thrombocytopenia alters endothelial cell permeability and integrity. Purpuric hemorrhages in severe thrombocytopenia occur by rupture of endothelial cells rather than by extravasation through endothelial junction. Platelets derived growth factors regulate angiogenesis. Platelet microvesicles may mediate some of the effects attributed to platelets. The recent findings also suggest that platelet microvesicles induce angiogenesis and endothelial cell migration. We have recently shown that (developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), a 52 kDa glycoprotein mediates the uptake of platelet microvesicles by endothelium both in vitro and in vivo. We propose that endothelium is the physiological mediator of microvesicles clearance. Uptake of microvesicles by the endothelial cells induces several functional and morphological changes in endothelium. More recently, we have shown that platelet microvesicles can deliver microRNAs endothelium raising the possibility that microvesicles can modulate endothelial cells function by modifying gene expression. We propose to characterize the significance of this novel finding. The specific aims of this proposal are (1) To further characterize the molecules involved in phosphatidylserine-dependent uptake and clearance of platelet microvesicles by endothelium (2) To determine the effect of microvesicles associated microRNAs on endothelial function and (3) to determine whether plasma levels of Del-1 and lactadherin are biomarkers of microvesicles clearance."

"9275380","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Exposure to gadolinium-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast is a major risk factor in the acquisition of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), a severely debilitating disease first recognized in patients with acute or chronic renal impairment. MRI contrast agents heretofore were considered safe in these patients and thus indiscriminately used. Gadolinium-based contrast agents remain a mainstay for MR imaging and alternatives are still lacking. The applicant's preliminary data show that MRI contrast elicits a direct proliferative effect on human fibroblasts with an increase in extracellular matrix synthesis in vitro. Rats with renal insufficiecy exposed to MRI contrast demonstrate significant skin abnormalities, including recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells. MRI contrast-treated mice similarly demonstrate skin fibrosis with dermal hypercellularity. Furthermore, gadolinium has been detected in affected rat and mouse skin as well as other organs (such as the kidneys and livers) from MRI contrast-treated animals. The overall objective of this proposal is to identify candidate mechanisms that trigger the aberrant pattern of fibrosis after exposure to gadolinium-based MRI contrast in the setting of renal insufficiency. The central hypothesis is that in the setting of renal insufficiency, MRI contrast exposure triggers a pro-fibrotic state in target organs, such as the skin. Subsequent generation of specific chemokines activate and recruit bone marrow-derived and circulating mesenchymal precursor cells, or fibrocytes, to the affected areas. These cells compound the fibrotic process by synthesizing and reducing the generation of extracellular matrix and inducing the proliferation of resident cells. Experiments will address the following Specific Objectives: 1a Determine the mechanism by which gadolinium-based contrast induces NSF. The applicant has proven that bone marrow-derived cells constitute around 44% of the dermal cellularity in skin lesions. Whether gadolinium deposition in the skin elicits the generation of pro-fibrotic cytokines that lead to fibrocyte recruitment or if gadolinium stimulation in other sites, such as the bone marrow, programs fibroblast precursors to hone to specific sites is unknown. The applicant will test this by priming bone marrow donor (transgenic, tagged) rats with exposure to MRI contrast and then transplanting this bone marrow into lethally-irradiated animals. 1b: Demonstrate that gadolinium-based contrast induces an increase in circulating fibrocytes. The effect of MRI contrast on the number of circulating fibrocytes at specific time points will be quantified in rats. 2a: Determine the chemokines and receptors responsible for recruitment of bone marrow-derived cells to specific tissues. The hypothesis is that the monocyte chemoattractant protein- (MCP-) 1/chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) axis modulates the recruitment of fibrocytes in MRI contrast-induced systemic fibrosis. The chemical mediators that lead to the recruitment of circulating cells to NSF lesions is not well-explored. Resistance to NSF will be examined in animals with a genetic deficiency CCR2 will be explored. The role of this protein will be validated by using bone marrow transplant experiments where CCR2-deficient bone marrow is transplanted to normal (wild-type) mice and vice-versa. 2b: Test the hypothesis that biodistribution of gadolinium differs between normal renal function and renal insufficiency in mice and rats. Even though prior publications definitively indicate that the liveris a major reservoir for gadolinium in MRI-contrast treated rats and mice, the skin is invariably involved in NSF and to a far greater extent than any liver pathology in experimental animals found to date by the applicant. If the deposition of gadolinium is the nidus for triggering the disease, perhaps biodistribution of gadolinium differs between the states of renal sufficiency and insufficiency. Gadolinium accumulation in organs potentially affected in NSF (skin, lungs, heart, diaphragm, liver, spleen, bone, muscle) will be compared in animals with renal insufficiency (subtotal nephrectomies) and sham-treated controls. The findings will lead to a better understanding of how systemic fibrosis occurs and why certain organs are targeted."
"9223568","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Although arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) are widely considered to be the best form of dialysis vascular access they currently have very significant problems with maturation failure, which is an inability to achieve adequate venous dilatation and flow to support dialysis. At a radiological level AVF maturation failure is characterized by a perianastomotic venous segment stenosis, while at a histological and pathogenetic level it is due to a combination of neointimal hyperplasia and an absence of outward remodeling. At a mechanistic level, work performed by us during the current grant period has clearly demonstrated that differing hemodynamic profiles result in very different clinical (flow and diameter) and histological end points. We therefore believe that hemodynamic injury is the critical upstream event, which then results in a downstream cascade of events (the vascular biology response to injury). An important unknown, however, remains the potential impact of uremia within this cascade, especially in the context of being able to modulate the downstream biological response to upstream hemodynamic injury. The reason that uremia is likely to be important is that it is characterized by significant increases in oxidaive stress, inflammation and endothelial dysfunction, all of which are key players in the downstream biological response to hemodynamic injury. In addition we, and others have been able to demonstrate the presence of neointimal hyperplasia within venous tissue samples taken at the time of dialysis vascular access creation (even before exposure to hemodynamic changes) suggesting that uremia per se (with its linkages to inflammation, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction), could be an important independent risk factor for venous stenosis/remodeling. The central hypothesis of the current proposal therefore is that AVF maturation is the end result of interactions between a wide spectrum of two prominent mechanistic pathways (upstream hemodynamic injury and uremia influenced downstream vascular biology). Put another way we want to explore how the presence or absence of uremia modulates the biological response to hemodynamic injury. We plan to address this central hypothesis through three Specific Aims. In Specific Aim 1, we will expand on the hypothesis that differential hemodynamic shear stress profiles (curved versus straight AVFs) initiate a sequence of differential biological (gene expression and cellular phenotyping) profiles, which then result in different morphometric (wall thickness) and clinical (flow and diameter) end points. This Specific Aim will also provide a historically concurrent comparator for the studies in Specific Aim 2. In Specific Aim 2, we will address the hypothesis that uremia per se can influence/modulate the biological response to hemodynamic injury, through a detailed comparison of the biological, morphometric and clinical end points described in Specific Aim 1 in the setting of a uremic pig model as compared to control animals (from Specific Aim 1). Finally in Specific Aim 3, we will combine the power of next generation sequencing technology (RNA Seq. analyses) with our unique animal model of uremia in order to look to the future, with regard to the identification of novel genes, pathways and mechanisms. This information could then be used to identify novel predictive markers for AVF maturation, or alternatively, as a knowledge base for the development of future biologically relevant therapies to prevent or treat AVF maturation failure. In summary, we believe that this proposal is significant because it focuses on an important clinical problem for which there are currently no effective therapies; it is unique in that it addresses head on the complex issue of uremia per se as a modulator of AVF maturation, and finally it is innovative in that it links advanced sequencing technology and bioinformatics to a clinically relevant uremic model."
"9268508","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease (AD) is an age-related neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive cognitive decline and dementia as well as pre-symptomatic accumulation of amyloid pathology. A number of recently identified AD susceptibility loci contain genes expressed predominantly in myeloid cells, such as monocytes, macrophages and microglia. This suggests the involvement of the innate immune system in AD susceptibility and the accumulation of amyloid pathology. Therefore, we hypothesized that monocyte-derived cells, such as infiltrating macrophages as well as resident microglia are involved in the pathophysiology of AD and, particularly, in the accumulation of amyloid pathology. Our preliminary cis-eQTL analyses of data from healthy young individuals have implicated 16 AD susceptibility genes in myeloid cell function, whose expression, relative to each risk allele, is altered in monocytes and not in T cells that represent the adaptive arm of the immune system. Therefore, these loci represent excellent candidates as the first step in the cascade of molecular events that link genetic risk factors to the altered innate immune function that contributes to AD pathology. The principal goals of the proposed project are (1) to identify and validate the component genes of networks perturbed by the AD susceptibility loci in myeloid cells (2) to understand their functional consequences on monocyte behavior and (3) identify FDA- approved or novel small molecules that modulate the most promising targets for AD therapy in primary human monocytes."

CHARLS is directly patterned on the HRS and its sister surveys in England, Europe, Japan, Indonesia and South Korea. The new HRS surveys in India (LASI) and Thailand (HART) have used the CHARLS survey modules as the starting point of their modules.  The CHARLS national baseline survey was conducted in 2011-12. It is a nationally representative survey that includes one person per household aged 45 years of age or older and their spouse (totaling 17,708 individuals) living in 10,257 households in 450 villages/urban communities in 150 counties/districts in 28 of China's 30 provinces excluding Tibet. The CHARLS national baseline data have recently been released publicly, 11 months after completing field operations. Wave 2 was fielded in the summer and fall of 2013. It will be publicly released by fall of 2014. Some 91% of wave 1 respondents were re-contacted in wave 2, plus a small refresher sample of new respondents who had reached age 45 since wave 1, plus some households that we were unable to contact in the baseline, that we found and interviewed in wave 2. A special wave to collect life history data will be fielded in the summer of 2014, using resources from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) and other sources. We want to continue CHARLS, getting the full benefit of building a publicly available panel data set, by fielding CHARLS for 2 additional waves, 3 and 4, thus establishing CHARLS as an ongoing biennial panel survey, like the HRS and its other sister surveys in Europe and Asia.  An HRS-type survey in China has been past overdue. The importance of research on aging is recognized world-wide, where numerous high-quality surveys modeled after the US Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) and funded by National Institute on Aging (NIA), are ongoing. Developing countries, especially in Asia, are going through rapid demographic and health transitions in which the elderly become much more prominent and the nature of health problems changes from infectious diseases, which affect mainly the young, to chronic diseases, which affect the elderly. Moreover, they are undergoing the aging process at much lower income levels than was the experience in industrial countries. China is a prominent example. China has more elderly than any country in the world and is one of the fastest-aging countries in the world today. China's population is aging at income levels far lower than was true for industrial countries and aging faster than other currently developing countries. Compared to most other countries with Health and Retirement Studies, China is much more rural, with lower levels of schooling among the elderly, lower levels of public services available, and an enhanced importance of the family for social security. Given these major challenges facing China to meet the needs of a rapidly aging population, there is significant value in continuing to make a high quality panel data set on aging available to international researchers."
"9295907","ABSTRACT Genome maintenance systems in complex organisms act to promote cell survival at the cost of occasional mutations as a consequence of repair or replication errors. When DNA damage levels are high, these systems can induce apoptosis or cellular senescence to prevent a high mutation load, the most serious consequence of which is cancer. Hence, genome maintenance systems protect organisms at early ages when the impact of losing proliferative cells to apoptosis or senescence is low. However, at later ages the impact of accumulating mutations, depleting cells through apoptosis, and accumulating non-dividing, pro-inflammatory senescent cells is high. Therefore, genome maintenance systems and their sequelae are another example of antagonistic pleiotropy. Importantly, this balancing act can be manipulated, as demonstrated by various conditions that extend life span, including dietary restriction, somatotrophic restraint and possibly the microRNA-mediated cell preservation response. In this renewal application, we propose to further characterize the pro-aging effects of DNA damage and explore if human extreme longevity and healthy aging can be related to exceptional genome maintenance. Based on the results we will then use premature aging mouse models to develop and test novel interventions that promote healthy aging and longevity. The results should clarify the relationships in humans and mice between specific defects in genome maintenance and aging phenotypes, better define proximal end points of aging driven by DNA damage and cellular damage responses in humans and mice and lead to molecular and cellular interventions that alleviate genotoxic stress and/or improve genome maintenance. Based on a wealth of evidence suggesting a causal relationship between adverse health effects associated with aging and DNA damage responses, this PPG application is designed to resolve the complex web of cause and effect relationships between DNA damage and aging, establish clear links between human and mouse DNA damage responses, and explore logical routes to modify these responses to ameliorate genome degeneration and its adverse health effects."
"9275306","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Recent breakthroughs in our understanding of pathobiology of atherogenesis necessitate revision of overly simplistic concept of 'good and bad cholesterol and suggest novel directions for the development of effective therapies. During the last few years, oxidation of low density lipoproteins (LDL) and scavenger-receptor dependent internalization of oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) by vascular cells was established to be a main factor driving atherogenesis.  Endothelial monolayer is a primary component of vascular wall interacting with oxidatively modified LDL. Its activation and angiogenic responses are prerequisites for initiation and progression of atherosclerosis as well as plaque instability and eventual rupture. Our group has shown that ox-LDL internalization is mediated predominantly by a lectin-like ox-LDL receptor (LOX-1) and that ox-LDL mediated stimulation of angiogenesis is LOX-1 dependent. In our earlier studies in a murine model of hypercholesterolemia, we have also shown that abrogation of LOX-1 results in significant attenuation of atherosclerosis. Based on these findings we believe that LOX-1 may become an attractive target for therapeutic interventions.  In search for approaches to inhibition of ox-LDL/endothelium interactions, we have determined microRNAs implicated in LOX-1 regulation and ox-LDL downstream signaling using physiologically realistic exposures to ox-LDL. We have also screened and identified candidate small molecules that, based on existing models of LOX-1/ox- LDL interactions, demonstrate a potential to block LOX-1 binding site.  We propose to conduct studies that would evaluate miRNA and small molecules based therapies with regard to plaque angiogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis. The objectives of the current proposal are to: a) further elucidate the role of ox- LDL/LOX-1 signaling in relation to angiogenesis, and b) determine efficacy of LOX-1- centered miRNA and small molecule-based interventions in prevention of angiogenesis and atherosclerosis.  The PI has been engaged in the research on LOX-1 biology for the last 15 years and his group significantly contributed to elucidation of LOX-1 biology - especially in relation to cardiovascular conditions - with more than 50 publications in major peer- reviewed journals."
"9298694","Mounting amounts of diverse biomedical data have been generated. Extracting meaningful  information from these datasets has relied on the efforts of informaticians, who are extensively trained in the  computer science realm, with little to no training in biology. Similarly, biologists in general are not proficient  to analyze, annotate, and translate their large datasets into valuable biomedical insights. In addition, there  has been an overall lack of public understanding for the importance of Big Data science, hindering the  enthusiasm to advance data science in the biomedical field. To bridge the gaps that exist among data  generation, interpretation and awareness, our training program will provide critical data science education to  current biomedical researchers, expand the data science workforce in the biomedical field, and elicit a broad  public recognition of data science. Accordingly, we have engineered an integrated training program with four  specific aims: 1) To empower current biomedical researchers with the ability to manage and interpret Big  Data by gaining proficiency in utilizing data science software tools; 2) To utilize the training component as an  interactive testing field for software packages developed by the Data Science Research (DSR) component.  User critiques/feedback will refine and transform software tools to a professional grade, facilitating the  community to capture the full value of Big Data; 3) To cultivate a new generation of developers with transdisciplinary  expertise in both computational biology and biomedical informatics; and 4) To heighten public  awareness of and enthusiasm for the substantial opportunities embedded within computational biology,  which has the potential to transform biomedical research and medicine. To achieve these aims, we have  constructed three trainee-oriented modules: Biomedical Researcher /User-Oriented Module, Big Data  Science Researcher-Oriented Module, and General Public-Oriented Module. A trans-institutional  collaboration has been organized (i.e., UCLA, TSRI, UMMC, and EMBL-EBI), and all components have  demonstrated outstanding track records in education. This collaboration will ensure successful execution of  the training component substantiated by distinguished experts and meritorious educators from a wide  breadth of disciplines, spanning -omics, bioinformatics, and computational science."

"9320707","AAV vectors have emerged as a promising delivery system for gene therapy of numerous muscular dystrophies. Systemic delivery protocols have been developed in mice that lead to whole body amelioration of the pathophysiology, suggesting that this approach could lead to an effective therapy. Most studies have been performed in models for recessively inherited disorders such as DMD, but related approaches have begun to be adapted for dominantly inherited disorder such as FSHD. However, many obstacles remain before whole body treatment via AAV can be achieved in humans. These include developing robust and safe methods for wide spread targeting of critical muscle groups including limb, respiratory and cardiac muscles. Critical to these goals is a need for gene regulatory cassettes that can direct high-level gene expression in all skeletal muscle fiber types and anatomical muscles, but not in non-muscle cells including immune effector cells. A further need is to expand the utility of these approaches by developing vectors that can safely and efficiently knock-down mutant gene products in dominantly inherited dystrophies. This project is a collaborative effort among a diverse and highly experienced group of scientists with extensive expertise in the study of muscle biology, muscular dystrophy, gene expression, RNAi and gene therapy. We propose to adapt methods for AAV-mediated gene transfer to large animal models for DMD by focusing on expression cassette design, AAV serotype comparisons, delivery methods and scale-up to test the hypothesis that AAV vectors can be used to target all the major muscle groups of the body. In parallel, we will adapt AAV systems for targeting and studying the dominant disorder FSHD, using cell lines and mouse models. Together these studies could lead to human clinical trials for DMD using regional limb, diaphragm and cardiac delivery of AAV vectors, and will bring gene therapy for dominant disorders closer to pre-clinical testing. One clinical trial involving IM injection of AAV for DMD is already planned at Seattle Children's Hospital, and together with the clinical trials infrastructure development in Project 2 these studies could lead to increased clinical interventions for both dominantly and recessively inherited muscular dystrophies.models.

"9266764","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Although minority elders represent the fastest growing segment of an aging US population, they have less access to mental health care and prevention of disability, lagging well behind non-Latino whites, and suffering significant disparities. Blacks and Latinos have the greatest risk for disability, with striking disparities in healthy aging. This includes elderly immigrants who exhibit elevated depressive and anxiety symptoms, and higher rates of disability than the native-born population; yet, they often go undiagnosed or underdiagnosed. This is a missed opportunity given that mood disorder treatment has been shown to reduce disability days and that several risk factors for disability, such as functional mobility are modifiable. Research suggests that a contributing factor may be an insufficient supply of professional providers and the inability of evidence based treatments to reach and be acceptable to minority elders. An IOM committee recently reported that the severe workforce shortages in providing mental health care to elder adults required novel approaches to resolve. To address these disparities and prevent disability among minority elders, the proposed R01 examines how to successfully build collaborative research for the provision of evidence-based mental health and disability prevention treatments in community-based settings. Promising results in a few international studies show improved access and quality of mental health outcomes and reduced disability when interventions are delivered by Community Health Workers. Yet limited and inconsistent evidence of the efficacy of CHW-led interventions in the US context remains. While the number of community-based health interventions has grown exponentially to address these service disparities, there is a lack of systematic assessment of whether they lead to increased community capacity and systems change, and whether they improve the quality of care and potentially decrease disability. Our proposed study endeavors to address this limitation. As such, the proposed R01 will be one of few efforts that simultaneously study the three components necessary for a successful intervention: efficacy, since the intervention must work, acceptability among clients, and feasibility and sustainability within the organization. It seeks to understand the role of the partnerships in increasing community capacity for a combined mental health and disability prevention intervention, and evaluating the acceptability, efficacy, feasibility and sustainability of the intervention delivere by CHWs and exercise trainers to Latino, African American and Asian elders with moderate to severe mood symptoms and at risk of disability."
"9254529","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Chronic inflammatory diseases such as periodontal disease are greatly exacerbated in diabetic patients (Wang and Kaltenboeck, 2010). The mechanism of the acceleration of periodontitis remains unknown, however, diabetes and periodontitis both activate the pro-inflammatory transcription factor NF-B. Upon stimulation, NF-?B recruits other proteins such as modification enzymes. Modification enzymes alter the chromatin structure via histone modification mechanisms ultimately regulating transcription. In the present study, we will examine histone methylation of gene promoters concomitantly expressed in high glucose conditions (diabetes) and under lipopolysaccharide (LPS) challenge (periodontitis). Microarray gene expression analysis from our preliminary study revealed that periopathic LPS challenge affects three groups of NF-kB target genes corresponding to unique histone methylation signature: (i) immediate-early response genes associated with cell recruitment such as CCL2, CXCL1,and IL-6 which demonstrated active H3K4me3 methylation (ii) late response genes associated with cell activation and defense mechanisms such as IL-1ß, TNF-?, and several defensins that featured repressive H3K9me3 and/or H3K27me3 methylation and (iii) matrix-related genes involved in bone and connective tissue metabolism such as collagens I and III, MMP2 and 9, and RANKL were occupied by both active and repressive trimethylation marks. We propose that long-term inflammation severely alters the methylation state of these periodontal connective tissues which diminishes its ability to function normally and results in chronic periodontitis. We thus hypothesize that in response to periopathic LPS challenge and high glucose conditions, NF-kB avails itself of the histone methylation machinery, resulting in upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes and dysregulation of matrix-related genes, linked to exacerbated periodontitis under diabetic conditions. We have therefore developed a research plan to (1) identify gene expression and epigenetic histone methylation patterns in the aforementioned groups of NF-kB target genes during the progression of periodontitis, (2) to determine the role of NF-?B and chromatin modifications in the exacerbated periodontal phenotype of diabetic animals, and (3) identify the relationship between NF-?B signaling, chromatin structure and histone methylation. Together, these experiments will provide epigenetic information about functional links between diabetes and periodontitis which may result in improvements in therapeutic strategies for periodontitis under diabetic conditions."

Pore-forming toxins produced by Streptococcus pneumoniae and other airway pathogens have been shown to trigger lung cell necroptosis and this is responsible for much of the injury that is observed. The elderly are in particular vulnerable to pneumonia, with lower respiratory tract infections being the 4th leading cause of death in those ?65 years of age. Thus, inhibition of necroptosis is potential way to protect vulnerable individuals, such as the elderly, from the lung damage that occurs during bacterial pneumonia. We hypothesize that cell death by necroptosis increases with advanced age and this contributes to inflamm- aging. Also, that blocking necroptosis can protect the elderly from lung injury during pneumonia. Herein, we will leverage our expertise on aging, necroptosis, and bacterial pneumonia to test these hypotheses and improve our understanding of necroptosis and its impact during aging. We will: AIM 1. Determine the role of necroptosis on inflamm-aging and age-related decline in function. We have mice deficient in RIP3 and MLKL that cannot undergo necroptosis. We will compare pro-inflammatory cytokine and alarmin profiles in serum from WT, heterozygote, and KO mice at 6, 14, and 24 months of age. We will also examine aged WT mice treated for 7 days with two different necroptosis inhibitors. For all mice, we will examine the activation status of NFkB and MAPK in the thymus, lungs, heart, spleen, liver, kidney, brain, and visceral adipose by western and in immune cells (monocytes, B cells, T cells) by flow cytometry. We will also longitudinally measure activity, gait, and muscle strength to learn if blocking necroptosis impacts health status. AIM 2. Determine if blocking necroptosis protects aged animals against pneumonia. Alveolar macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages from 6, 14 and 24 month old mice will be tested for their propensity to undergo necroptosis following exposure to the pore-forming toxin pneumolysin. Different aged WT, heterozygote, and MLKL KO mice, along with WT mice treated with necroptosis inhibitors will be intratracheally challenged with pneumolysin or infected with S. pneumoniae. Lung damage and disease severity will be assessed by measuring inflammatory cytokines, pathology, and bacterial burden, respectively. This proposal is in response to PAR-14-191:T1 Translational Research: Novel Interventions for Prevention and Treatment of Age-Related Conditions. We will determine the contribution of necroptosis to inflamm-aging and learn if blocking necroptosis protects against inflamm-aging related decline and pneumonia."
"9275415","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Background/Rationale: We now have established that NEU1 sialidase is expressed in human lung microvascular endothelial cell (HPMEC)s, where it associates with and desialylates CD31, also known as platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1. Further, NEU1 disrupts CD31-driven HPMEC capillary- like tube formation or in vitro angiogenesis. NEU1 requires association with its own chaperone//transport protein, protective protein/cathepsin A (PPCA), for full catalytic activity. We hypothesize that during barrier formation and angiogenesis, as HPMECs engage each other and the CD31-ectodomain (ED)s homophilically interact, the cytoplasmic adapter protein, TNFa Receptor-Associated Factor (TRAF)6, physically associates with and activates one or more src family kinase (SFK)s, which in turn, increases tyrosine phosphorylation of p120 catenin. This phosphoprotein facilitates recruitment of NEU1, most likely accompanied by PPCA, to CD31, permitting removal of sialic acid residues from the CD31-ED and disruption of CD31-driven angiogenesis. Increased NEU1 expression may contribute to the pathogenesis of lung diseases, including Idiopathic pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Objective(s): 1. To define the CD31 domain(s) required for its recruitment of NEU1 and/or PPCA in human lung microvascular endothelia. 2. To define the mechanism(s) through which the adapter protein, TRAF6, in concert with one or more SFK(s), regulate NEU1 recruitment to CD31. 3. To define the mechanism(s) through which NEU1 sialidase regulates in vitro EC capillary-like tube formation and in vivo angiogenesis. 4. To establish patterns of NEU1 expression and catalytic activity in the lung tissues of normal subjects and patients with Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). Methods: A primary HPMEC system in which NEU1, PPCA, ST6GAL-I, CD31, SFKs, TRAF6, and p120ctn will be manipulated through siRNA technology or infection with adenoviral vectors encoding for wild-type and catalytically-dead NEU1, PPCA, ST6GAL-I, and wild-type and dominant-negative TRAF6. Lung microvascular ECs harvested from wild-type, NEU1-/-, and CD31-/- mice with and without gene rescue will also be studied. Protein-protein interactions will be studied with co-immunoprecipitation, GST-fusion protein pull-down, and Far Western blotting/gel-overlay assays. Finally, angiogenesis will be measured on Matrigel in vitro, and in mice implanted with HPMECs in which expression of NEU1, CD31, SFK(s), TRAF6, and/or p120ctn, have been manipulated. NEU1 mRNA and protein expression will be quantified in lung tissues from IPF patients. Findings/Results: We have established that in postconfluent HPMECs, NEU1 sialidase is recruited to and desialylates CD31.The NEU1-CD31 association is both TRAF6- and SFK-dependent and p120ctn is involved. NEU1 overexpression reduces EC adhesion to extracellular matrix, restrains EC migration into a wound, and impairs in vitro angiogenesis in a CD31-dependent manner. ST6GAL-I counteracts the NEU1 effect. NEU1 expression is increased in the pulmonary vascular endothelium of IPF patients. Status: This project will explore new concepts that are not an extension of any previously funded project(s). Impact: If our proposed studies are successfully completed, they will generate a paradigm shift in which NEU1 can be selectively recruited to specific receptor(s), to regulate their sialylation state(s) and responsiveness. Increased NEU1 expression may mechanistically contribute to IPF pathophysiology."

Rho currently provides safety monitoring and oversight for all of these consortia, except for  Consortium of Food Allergy Research (CoFAR) and will maintain our high quality of safety reporting activities  for these consortia and CoFAR as part of this cooperative agreement. The goal of the SORG is to achieve a  high-quality, standardized process for receiving, processing, following, and reporting safety information for all  clinical trials conducted by the consortia. Rho proposes to achieve this goal by creating a comprehensive  safety management plan that will provide structure and detailed procedures for safety oversight activities  across all studies. In addition, for each protocol, a protocol-specific safety management plan will be created to  outline protocol-specific requirements. The safety management plan includes description of responsibilities,  how adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) will be monitored, real-time notifications to DAIT  and other appropriate individuals of SAEs, safety reporting workflow and timeframes for when regulatory  reports will be provided for submission to maintain compliance for U.S. and non-U.S regulations and  requirements, protocol-specific templates, and identification of the reference safety document for determining  regulatory expectedness/listedness.   Additionally, the SORG will provide input during the development of study documents such as the  protocol, investigator brochure, data forms, plans, and reports to ensure AEs and SAEs are monitored  appropriately. For each protocol a lead product safety monitor (PSM) will be assigned. PSMs are assigned to a  specific disease group, but everyone is cross-trained to provide back-up support. The PSM will educate site  staff in how to appropriately recognize, record, and report AEs and SAEs. SAE data provided by the sites will  be entered by the SORG into a secure, validated database specifically for entering, tracking, coding, reporting,  analyzing and archiving SAE data.   The SORG will also provide support to DAIT safety oversight structures by creating thorough, high-quality  safety reports and presentations and by maintaining the DSMB Portal, a centralized place for all materials,  agendas, and conflict of interest information."

"9275309","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Renal ischemia-reperfusion leads to acute kidney injury (AKI), a major kidney disease that is associated with high mortality and affects both the general population and veterans. A key pathological feature of ischemic AKI is necrotic and apoptotic cell death in renal tubules. The long- term goal of Dr. Dong is to delineate the mechanism of tubular cell death in kidneys and discover new, effective strategies for the prevention and treatment of AKI. During the last grant period, Dr. Dong and colleagues revealed a striking morphological change of mitochondria during apoptosis, called mitochondrial fragmentation. Inhibition of mitochondrial fragmentation prevented apoptosis in renal tubules and ameliorated AKI, supporting a critical pathogenic role. Mechanistically, mitochondrial fragmentation requires the cleavage of both mitochondrial inner and outer membranes. Cleavage of the outer membrane involves the activation of Drp-1 and inactivation of Mitofusins; however, very little is known about cleavage of the inner membrane. Dr. Dong and colleagues have now demonstrated a role of Bax-interacting factor-1 (Bif-1) in mitochondrial fragmentation. Moreover, they have discovered the novel interaction of Bif-1 with prohibitin 2 (PHB2), a protein that may regulate mitochondrial inner membrane by sequestering OMA1 to prevent the proteolysis of OPA1, an inner membrane fusion protein. Based on these observations, they hypothesize that: During cellular stress, Bif-1 translocates to mitochondria and interacts with PHB2, resulting in the disruption of the prohibitin ring complex to release OMA1. OMA1 then has the access to OPA1 for proteolytic cleavage and inactivation, leading to the inhibition of inner membrane fusion to contribute to mitochondrial fragmentation. To test this hypothesis, they will: 1) determine the role of Bif-1 in prohibitin ring complex disruption, OPA1 proteolysis, mitochondrial damage and apoptosis during ischemic AKI; 2) elucidate the molecular interaction between Bif-1 and PHB2, and determine its role in mitochondrial regulation; 3) determine the role of OMA1 in OPA1 proteolysis, mitochondrial fragmentation and tubular cell apoptosis. This application will delineate the molecular mechanism of inner membrane cleavage in mitochondrial fragmentation and apoptosis. It may also lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for ischemic AKI and related diseases."
"9275368","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 5-7% of all hospital admissions and recent evidence has shown that even minor changes in renal function are associated with increased risk of death. In the ICU, AKI is associated with 50% mortality, a statistic which has not changed even with dialysis therapy. In fact the Acute Renal Failure Trial Network study, a combined VA and NIH sponsored dialysis dosing study, showed no change in mortality statistics when comparing dialysis dosing. Clearly new approaches are urgently needed to address this life-threatening disease. Given the fact that the VA population is aging, prone to diabetes and hypertension, AKI is a major health problem in this group. Upon completion of this VA Merit Review, investigators in the renal community will have new targets for small molecular drug discovery that should ameliorate the mortality associated with AKI."
"9276256","PROJECT SUMMARY  The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) has increased more than 5-fold in the past three decades  while the prognosis has remained poor. Barrett's esophagus (BE) is the only known precursor of EAC.  Endoscopy (EGD) is the only method to diagnose BE but because EGD is expensive and screening is not  recommended very few EACs are detected in patients with pre-diagnosed BE. To make an impact on the  prevention and early detection of EAC the challenge is to first develop an alternative method for screening that  is less costly and safer than EGD while being acceptable and accessible. A non-endoscopic detection method  would allow screening in the primary care setting. Aberrant methylation of vimentin and other markers can be  detected in DNA extracted from endoscopic brushings in over 90% of BE subjects. The BETRNet focus of Project  2 is to directly translate these epigenetic markers of BE and EAC that we have discovered to clinically novel  methods for detection and risk stratification of BE. This project grows out of the discovery that methylated genes,  have the potential to be used as detection biomarkers for BE or EAC. This project:   1) Uses a novel non-endoscopic distal esophageal sampling method to determine the accuracy of   methylation markers as detection markers for BE;   2) Detects BE in an unscreened population of colonoscopy patients by assaying the optimal marker(s)   3) Determines whether a panel of aberrantly methylated genes associated with high grade dysplasia and   EAC can be detected in esophageal brushings or nonendoscopic distal esophageal samples to enable   risk stratification strategies;  Project 2 is clearly aimed at having significant translational impact at decreasing mortality from EAC through the  development of a convenient non-invasive screening program."
"9275312","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Project Summary/Abstract Defective regulation of early intestinal mucosal restitution underlies various critical pathological states such as acute mucosal injury/hemorrhage, impaired repair of erosions/ulcers, disruption of epithelial integrity, and epithelial barrier dysfunction. Since the exact mechanisms of early rapid mucosal restitution after superficial wounds are still obscure, effective therapies to preserve gut epithelial integrity in clinic are limited, especially in patiets with critical surgical illnesses such as trauma and sepsis. The restoration of normal intestinal mucosal integrity after injury and/or ulceration requires epithelial cell decisions that regulate signaling networks controlling expression of various genes. Posttranscriptional events, particularly altered mRNA turnover and translation, are major mechanisms by which mammalian cells control gene expression in response to various stresses. Changes in mRNA stability and translation are predominantly governed by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) that are emerged as master regulators of maintenance of gut epithelial integrity. However, little is known about the roles of RBPs and miRNAs in the mechanisms underlying rapid mucosal restitution after acute injury. HuR is among the most prominent translation and turnover regulatory RBPs and is recently show to regulate cell motility. Our preliminary results indicate that a) HuR silencing represses intestinal epithelial cell (IEC) migration over the wounded area in an in vitro model; b) tissue specific HuR knockout inhibits early intestinal mucosal repair after injury; and c) miR-195 overexpression represses early epithelial repair in vitro, but this repression is rescued by increasing HuR levels. Based on these exciting observations, we HYPOTHESIZE that HuR is essential for intestinal epithelial restitution after injury by altering the stability and translation of target mRNAs encoding cell migration-regulatory proteins and its effect is regulated by given miRNAs. Three specific aims are proposed to test the hypothesis. 1) To determine the exact role of HuR in early intestinal mucosal restitution after acute injury. 2) To define new target mRNAs of HuR and its role in the regulation of mRNA stability and translation in the intestinal epithelium after wounding. 3) To investigate the interactions between HuR and given miRNAs in the control of stability and translation of target mRNAs in response to epithelial injury. Completion of these specific aims will make a significant conceptual advance by linking HuR/miRNA-mediated posttranscriptional gene regulation with early mucosal restitution in the intestine and will create a fundamental base for development of new therapeutic approaches for gut mucosal injury-related diseases and for maintaining epithelial integrity under various clinical conditions."
"9275337","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     In the peripheral nervous system, Schwann cells (SCs) extend plasma membrane processes to wrap axons with myelin. Myelin sheath thickness and internodal distance are important determinants of nerve conduction velocity, which is critical for precise control of timing impulse conduction. Acquired myelin disorders include nerve injury, Carpal tunnel syndrome, immune-mediated demyelinating diseases, multiple sclerosis (MS) and Guillian-Barre syndrome, some of which are known to affect war veterans.  Remyelination or myelin repair is critical for the recovery from myelin disorders. However, underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Recent studies demonstrate that neuregulin 1 (NRG1), which is known to be critical for myelin development in the peripheral nervous system, also plays an important role in remyelination after nerve injury. In Preliminary Results, we found that mutant mice of Erbin, a protein that interacts with the NRG1 receptor ErbB2, are impaired in remyelination of axons of injured nerves and  slow in functional recovery. Moreover, Erbin expression was induced in injured sciatic nerves, in advance of elevation in ErbB2. Remarkably, this increase was blocked in Erbin null mice. These results identified Erbin as a novel regulator of remyelination and are in consistent with the hypothesis that Erbin promotes remyelination of regenerated axons by regulating NRG1/ErbB2 signaling. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) characterize remyelination and NRG1 signaling in Erbin mutant mice where Erbin is truncated with the  PDZ domain and thus is unable to interact with ErbB2, to determine whether the interaction between Erbin and ErbB2 is important for remyelination; 2) to understand cellular mechanisms by which Erbin regulates remyelination; and 3) to investigate how Erbin regulates ErbB2 stability and trafficking in SCs.  Successful completion of these aims will elucidate novel mechanisms that govern SC behavior during nerve repair and provide insight into how Erbin regulates NRG1 signaling. Results may contribute to a better understanding of peripheral neuropathies of war veterans and to development of potential targets for therapy and diagnosis."
"9343410","ABSTRACT/SUMMARY ? Overall Systems Analysis of Epigenomic Architecture in Cancer Progression Despite anti-hormone therapies in patients, the cognate receptors ER? and AR can remain functional to support oncogenic signaling for advanced progression of breast and prostate cancers. Intensive studies have uncovered cellular and biochemical changes underlying the development of hormone resistance. However, epigenetic mechanisms for establishing and maintaining a hormone-resistant phenotype remain to be explored. Our preliminary studies have found remarkably similar epigenetic machineries that regulate hormone-independent gene transcription in both breast and prostate cancers. This process has multifaceted components, involving trans- and cis-acting elements, nucleosome reorganization, and chromatin interactions. To understand this complex mechanism, the San Antonio-Ohio State University Research Center for Cancer Systems Biology (SA-OSU RCCSB) has assembled a team of 21 experimental and computational investigators, and oncologists who will study a three-tiered epigenetic framework for gene regulation. First, microenvironmental cues initiate the recruitment of a specific combination of trans-bound transcription factors (TFs), called MegaTrans TFs, to ER? or AR-bound enhancers (Project 1). MegaTrans TFs are composed of diverse signaling-dependent transcription factors that activate these enhancers through receiving other signal cues without hormone stimulation. Second, this hormone-independent action requires well-orchestrated repositioning of nucleosomes, enabling maximal MegaTrans-DNA contact in target chromatin regions (Project 2). Pioneer factor FOXA1 and chromatin remodelers are also critical regulators of repositioned nucleosomes during the transition of a hormone-sensitive to -resistant phenotype. Third, this concerted action triggers chromatin movement, remotely bringing the MegaTrans/enhancer complexes in close proximity to target promoters (Project 3). Intra- and inter-chromatin interactions facilitate the formation of transcriptional architectures that efficiently and autonomously regulate ER?/AR-mediated gene expression even in the absence of agonists or in the presence of antagonists. Experimental investigators will use omics-seq platforms to map combinatorial MegaTrans complexes, repositioned nucleosomes, and topologically associated domains (TADs) that spatiotemporally regulate hormone-independent transcription. Computational scientists will then use omics data to derive 3D models of DNA-eRNA-protein interacting units in subnuclear compartments of cancer cells. Back to the bench, experimental scientists will use in silico findings to validate enhancer/gene markers that predict a hormone-resistant phenotype in patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) and clinical samples. To ensure seamless data integration of the three proposed projects, a Data Analysis and Management Core will implement customized toolkits to manage computational infrastructure and store omics-seq metadata for heuristic queries by community systems biologists. An Outreach Core will facilitate training of new-generation systems biologists and enhance collaborative efforts within the NCI's consortium and in the 4D nucleome community. An Administrative Core will provide governance and oversee rigorous evaluations of Intra-center Pilot Projects (IPPs), ensure cross-pollination between bench and in silico scientists in the SA-OSU RCCSB, and reinforce national guidelines of data sharing."

Standardize processes and procedures across the entire program   ? Address high-level issues regarding study design, implementation, and analysis   ? Keep the Center current with industry and NIH standards   ? Provide administrative support to the Center   ? Allocate resources across the Center   ? Manage the financial aspects of the Center   Members of the LG will build on our past success with coordinating DAIT studies to develop effective  collaboration and communication channels for the Center. These same channels will be used for decision-  making and issue resolution. We have found through our work with large multi-protocol NIH coordinating  centers that effective communication requires a combination of approaches, including scheduled and ad hoc  meetings and teleconferences, use of a collaboration portal to share documents and status information, and  other tools and processes we have developed over time.   Ongoing monitoring and tracking of LG functions and progress is essential to maintaining timely, high  quality work across the Center. Activities must be monitored at the group level and across the Center. The LG  director and senior project manager assume responsibility for monitoring work across the Center.   With the goal of providing all stakeholders with the information needed to evaluate progress and identify  issues and monitor resources, Rho utilizes a number of standard processes, tools, and activities that can be  tailored to the needs of individual projects. As new needs arise, Rho refines these items to continuously  improve our tracking and monitoring methods."
"9264454","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): BACE1 is the ß-secretase enzyme that initiates Aß production and is a prime therapeutic target for AD. Drugs that inhibit BACE1 enzyme activity are in clinical trials for AD, however the safety and efficacy of these agents are unknown. Recent studies suggest that BACE1 inhibition may cause multiple neurological side effects. Thus, it is crucial to develop alternative therapeutic strategies that reduce BACE1 cleavage of APP without impairing essential BACE1 functions. We have shown that global BACE1 protein levels are markedly elevated in APP transgenic mouse and AD brains. Elevated BACE1 is concentrated within dystrophic axons and terminals surrounding amyloid plaques and is associated with increased generation of BACE1- cleaved APP fragments and Aß42. We also find that Aß42 causes increased resting [Ca2+]i and microtubule disruption in neurons. We hypothesize a feed-forward mechanism in which plaque-associated Aß causes axonal dystrophy, BACE1 accumulation, and accelerated Aß generation that drives AD progression. Elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms of dystrophic BACE1 elevation could lead to novel AD therapeutic strategies to normalize BACE1 levels and reduce peri-plaque Aß production, yet preserve BACE1 activity for essential functions and side effect mitigation. We hypothesize that Aß-induced Ca2+ influx into peri-plaque axons causes microtubule disruption, impaired axon transport, BACE1 accumulation, axonal dystrophy, and accelerated Aß generation and amyloid load. Our preliminary data show that Aß elevates resting [Ca2+]i in primary neurons via Ca2+-selective channels. Moreover, axons of Aß-treated primary neurons exhibit disrupted microtubules and impaired BACE1 axon transport. Peri-plaque dystrophic axons in 5XFAD mice also show elevated resting [Ca2+]i and disrupted microtubules. Using Ca2+ channel inhibitors or shRNA-AAVs, we will identify the channel(s) that mediates Aß-induced Ca2+ influx in neurons in vitro and in vivo (Aim 1). Additionally, using Ca2+ channel inhibitors or shRNA-AAVs, we will decrease Aß-induced elevated resting [Ca2+]i, block microtubule and motor protein disruption, improve axon transport, and reduce BACE1 elevation (Aim 2). We will also rescue BACE1 elevation and axon transport by exposing Aß-treated primary neurons and 5XFAD mice to the microtubule stabilizing agent Epothilone D and determine whether Aß-induced BACE1 elevation is tau-independent (Aim 2). Finally, we will determine whether BACE1 elevation accelerates Aß generation and amyloid progression by performing 1) 35S-metabolic labeling of Aß-treated primary neurons to measure de novo Aß production, 2) in vivo Aß microdialysis to analyze Aß production in peri-plaque regions, 3) multicolor Aß time-stamp labeling to analyze the rate of individual plaque growth and dystrophic neurite formation in 5XFAD mice (Aim 3). These experiments will provide proof of concept for therapeutic strategies to reduce peri-plaque BACE1 elevation as a safer alternative to direct inhibition of BACE1 enzyme activity."
"9246958","Project Summary/Abstract The goal of our grant application is a functional and anatomic dissection of the mouse bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). This nucleus regulates many behaviors, including social approach and interactions, response to predators, coping with physiological and behavioral stressors, and reward responses. The BNST is heterogeneous and contains many neuronal pools with distinct identities. One hypothesis to account for the functional diversity of the BNST is that different BNST neuronal pools serve distinct functions. Our previous work (funded by prior grant periods) and that of others has identified a population of aromatase expressing neurons located in the medial division posteromedial component of the BNST (BNSTmpm). Both aromatase and the BNST are critical for social interactions in males and females. Intriguingly, our work shows that there are more aromatase+ neurons in the BNSTmpm in males compared to females. We therefore hypothesize that aromatase+ BNSTmpm neurons influence the distinct social interactions displayed by the two sexes. In Aim 1, we will use genetically targeted tools to map the connectivity and stimulus responsivity of BNSTmpm neurons in males and females. In Aim 2, we will use genetic approaches to determine the necessity and sufficiency of BNSTmpm aromatase neurons for social interactions in males and females. In Aim 3, we will use genetically modified mice we have developed to determine the role of aromatase in adult BNSTmpm neurons in the regulation of social interactions. In summary, our proposed studies will provide insight into the neural pathways emanating from aromatase BNSTmpm neurons and their functional relevance in vivo. Health Relatedness: Neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions often reflect dysfunction of neural circuitry at a gross or microscopic level, and these remain poorly understood and therapeutically intractable. The BNST is a critical node linking amygdalar, hypothalamic, and cortical networks in the regulation of social interactions, response to various stressors, and reward pathways. Our proposed studies will shed light on the connectivity and functions of a subset of BNST neurons in the two sexes, thereby leading to an advance in basic scientific understanding of this region and the neural circuits within which it functions in health, and it may ultimately provide insights into future therapeutic or diagnostic applications for mental illness and common neurodegenerative conditions."
"9335241","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Growing evidence supports the presence of dysregulated pain modulation in older adults, an effect which may heighten age-associated risk for chronic pain. While persistent pain is common in older adults, chronic low back pain is the leading cause of disability in this population and results in significant impairments in psychosocial and physical functioning. Given reports of suboptimal treatment of pain in older adults, improvements in pain management in this cohort are of critical importance. Resilience is characterized as a dynamic process resulting in positive adjustment and adaptation after exposure to adversity. The benefits of resilience in health-related functioning are manifold, and recent evidence suggests that resilience plays an important role in fostering adaptive physiological and affective responses to pain. Given this, capitalizing on positive resources is a promising target for enhancing pain adaptation, and is especially salient to older adults given the burden of high-impact pain in this group. Therefore, the overall goal for this mentored career development application (K99/R00) is to fill this knowledge gap and characterize resilience    mechanisms associated with adaptive pain modulatory capacity in older adults with chronic low back pain. Primary training goals for the current application are to: 1) develop a comprehensive knowledge base in biopsychosocial processes of aging and enhance training in the assessment and treatment of older adults; 2) increase knowledge in the understanding and assessment of psychosocial and biological (i.e., inflammatory, neuroendocrine) markers associated with pain and resilience; and 3) augment training in the design, implementation, and analysis of randomized clinical trials. The proposed study is delineated into two phases. Study 1 (K99 Phase) will examine associations among measures of resilience, biological markers of inflammation and neuroendocrine activity, and pain modulatory capacity in older adults with chronic low back pain. Increased knowledge and understanding of the resilience pathways that promote adaptability to pain will allow for the development of a targeted resilience intervention during Study 2 (R00 Phase). This phase will provide the opportunity for examining intervention effects on pain modulatory function and patterns of pain- evoked recovery in physiological and affective systems, and will establish whether a resilience-oriented intervention confers benefits in psychosocial and physical functioning in older adults with chronic low back pain. The proposed career development plan extends from the PI's prior work on affective regulation and mechanisms of vulnerability in chronic pain, and will forge a path towards understanding and investigating psychological therapies of resilience that improve pain and disability in older adults."

"9407099","Project Summary Mitochondrial function declines with age and is exacerbated in disease states such as Parkinson's. One potential cause of the mitochondrial decline is the propagation of deleterious mitochondrial genomes (mtDNAs) throughout an organism's lifetime as has been observed in individual muscle cells or dopaminergic neurons. mtDNAs only encode respiratory chain and ATP synthase components and thus lesions result in oxidative phosphorylation (OxPhos) deficiency. Because mtDNAs exist at 100s-1000s of copies per cell, a lesion in a single genome is well tolerated. However, if the deleterious genome accumulates to greater than ~60%, pathology related to OxPhos dysfunction ensues including cell degeneration and death. It is currently unclear how deleterious mtDNAs are maintained, how they are propagated and ultimately why they are toxic. One mechanism by which cells respond to OxPhos deficiency is by activating the mitochondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt), which initiates a mitochondrial repair and recovery program. We have found that UPRmt activation provides protection against OxPhos deficiencies caused by nuclear mutations in OxPhos genes or against bacterial derived toxins (P. aeruginosa produces cyanide for example). Our surprising preliminary data indicate that the UPRmt is required to maintain and propagate deleterious mtDNAs in a C. elegans model of heteroplasmy. Therefore, we hypothesize that deleterious mtDNAs are selfish, or parasitic, and take advantage of an endogenous stress response program in place to repair and respond to mitochondrial dysfunction. Here, we plan to examine the consequences of UPRmt activation and deleterious mtDNA propagation as a contributor to age-associated mitochondrial dysfunction."
"9430683","PROJECT SUMMARY Due to the increasing prevalence of obesity in the world, understanding the mechanisms involved in adipocyte metabolism and the conditions that lead to insulin resistance and diabetes is important. In adipose tissue lipids are stored as triglyceride (TAG) within lipid droplets (LD) that are tightly regulated by an assortment of proteins. When the body needs energy, TAG from the LD is hydrolyzed to release free fatty acids (FFA) in a process called lipolysis. In fasting states, circulating FFAs are utilized by distal tissues for energy, whereas in brown adipocytes lipolysis provides fatty acids to be used for adaptive thermogenesis. In obese individuals, dysregulated lipolysis causes the release of an excess of FFA, which can lead to insulin resistance. Perilipin (plin1) is a protein found on the surface of LD that regulates lipolysis by acting as scaffold for many of the enzymes and adapter proteins involved with hydrolyzing TAG into FFA. The goal of this grant is to provide training for the applicant in order to study how activation of cyclic-AMP dependent protein kinase (PKA) regulates plin1 activity and the mechanisms by which plin1 recruits the lipolytic machinery to the LD surface, as well as its role in systemic metabolism. Specifically, our preliminary results show that a family of proteins called the 14-3-3 proteins associate with plin1 at a novel phosphorylation site that we hypothesize is a critical regulator of stimulated-lipolysis. We will study the role of 14-3-3 proteins binding to plin1 in regulating PKA- stimulated lipolysis using two different experimental approaches: 1) mutating the binding site within plin1 and 2) by expressing a dominant negative form of the 14-3-3 proteins, thereby sequestering the 14-3-3 proteins, within cultured adipocytes. We will determine the specific proteins that are associated with plin1 during lipolysis as well as the changes in proteins that are bound after mutation of the 14-3-3 binding site within plin1 by using mass spectrometry based proteomics. As confirmation of the proteomics work, we will investigate direct interactions of the various proteins bound to plin1 using confocal microscopy and fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Finally, we will generate a mouse that has a mutation in the 14-3-3 binding site within plin1 in vivo using CRISPR-mediated gene editing. These mice will be used to evaluate the effects of the mutation on changes in body composition, brown adipocyte thermogenesis, insulin-glucose homeostasis, adipocyte physiology including lipolysis, and the lipolytic complex of proteins that associate with plin1 to regulate lipolysis."
"9314766","Project Summary: This proposal describes a five-year career development and training plan for Dr. Jason Homsy, who is an Instructor in Medicine at Brigham and Women?s Hospital (BWH), Boston. Dr. Homsy has outlined a career development plan and research proposal that leverages his training in genetics and extensive resources in the Harvard community with skills in computational biology, statistics, genome analysis and genome editing to shed novel insight into the genetic causes of congenital heart disease (CHD). Dr. Homsy is mentored by Christine E. Seidman, M.D., Thomas W. Smith Professor of Medicine and Genetics at Harvard Medical School and BWH who is both a distinguished clinical cardiologist and member of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and National Academy of Sciences. Dr. C. Seidman works closely together with Dr. Jonathan Seidman, and both are world-renown human and molecular geneticists with a focus on cardiovascular genetics. Over the last twenty years, the Seidmans have mentored countless young investigators who go on to successful, independent research careers as physician scientists. Dr. Homsy?s career development plan includes educational resources at Harvard Medical School, BWH and the Broad Institute. Dr. Homsy has gathered an advisory committee that includes world experts in human genetics. This award will allow Dr. Homsy to continue studies on the genetic causes of CHD. He has shown that a significant number of children with CHD have spontaneous mutations (de novo mutations) that are damaging to protein function. Children with these mutations have a high likelihood of exhibiting additional disorders, such as neurodevelopmental and/or other birth defects, whereas a genetic cause of disease in children with isolated CHD is less clear. Additionally, the cause of disease in up to 80% of cases is still unknown. Dr. Homsy proposes that there is a class of CHD-causing variants in noncoding DNA (regulatory promoters and enhancers) that have not yet been identified. Supporting his hypothesis, many mutations in CHD that have been discovered are in genes such as transcription factors and chromatin modifiers that alter genome-wide transcriptional programs by interacting with noncoding DNA elements. Thus, mutations in these elements may be additional causes of CHD, particularly isolated CHD in which affected elements may be spatially and temporally restricted to heart development. Dr. Homsy?s research goals are to 1. Identify de novo mutations in noncoding DNA by whole genome sequencing of children with CHD but no identifiable genetic defect 2. Compare mutation rates in regulatory elements critical to heart development among CHD probands and control subjects with respect to an expectation model 3. Model mutations in iPS cells using CRISPR to determine effects on nearby gene expression 4. Functionally characterize noncoding elements according to clinical phenotypes of cases with mutations. Dr. Homsy will use this career development plan to build the foundation for becoming an independent academic physician scientist."
"9206093","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The recent breakthrough in hypertension research reveals that a novel WNK kinase family [(with-no- lysine (K)] and its two key down-stream substrates SPAK (Ste20/SPS1-related proline/alanine-rich kinase) and its homolog OSR1 (oxidative stress-responsive kinase 1) are evolutionarily conserved regulators of ion transporters by altering their net phosphorylation state  and play an important role in renal salt handling and in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Na+-K+-2Cl- cotransporter isoform 1 (NKCC1) transports 1Na+, 1K+, and 2Cl- ions into cells and is important in regulation of intracellular Na+ and Cl-, cell volume, and K+ uptake in the central nervous system (CNS) under physiological conditions. Previous studies from our lab and others' clearly indicate that over-stimulation of NKCC1 activity contributes to cerebral ischemic damage. Under ischemic conditions, NKCC1 activation causes intracellular Na+ and Cl- overload in astrocytes and neurons. The intracellular Na+ overload subsequently stimulates the reverse mode operation of Na+/Ca2+ exchange and leads to a delayed, secondary cytosolic Ca2+ rise and Ca2+ dysregulation in ER and mitochondria. Most importantly, either pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of NKCC1 shows significant neuroprotective effects in in vivo focal ischemia model (middle cerebral artery occlusion, MCAO) and in vitro ischemia model. Despite of the neuroprotective effects in ischemic brain damage by blocking NKCC1 activity, it remains unknown how NKCC1 protein is stimulated in ischemic brains and what are the up-stream regulatory mechanisms.  Our pilot study revealed robust stimulation of the WNK-SPAK/OSR1 signaling pathway in ischemic brains. The goal of this project is to investigate whether the cerebral WNK3-SPAK-NKCC1 signaling pathway contributes to ischemic brain damage and whether blocking the WNK3/SPAK kinases with a newly discovered WNK-SPAK pathway inhibitor STOCK1S-50699 or transgenic knockout of WNK3 (WNK3 KO), or SPAK (SPAK KO) is neuroprotective. Our preliminary study shows that WNK3 KO mice exhibited significantly reduced infarct volume, less axonal demyelination, and accelerated neurobehavioral recovery. New data in this resubmission illustrates a ~70% reduction in infarct volume in SPAK KO mice. These data provide fresh insight into the role of ion transporters and their regulatory kinases in ischemic neuroglial injury. Completion of this project will help us to determine whether the WNK3-SPAK kinase complex presents a compelling target for novel neuroprotective strategies for ischemic brain injury. Our study will pave a foundation for developing new WNK-SPAK inhibitors for ischemic brain damage therapy."
"9485419","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Sanfilippo B syndrome is a devastating lysosomal storage disorder due to deficiency of the enzyme alpha-N- acetylglucosaminidase (NAGLU). Most therapeutic approaches that have been used or proposed for the lysosomal storage diseases that are due to missing enzymes involve replacing that enzyme into the deficient host in some way- either using wild-type donor stem cells (which provide the missing enzyme), gene therapy to deliver the gene that encodes the enzyme, or by recombinant enzyme administration. All of these depend on the special property of lysosomal enzymes that is made possible by the mannose 6-phosphate receptor system: lysosomal enzymes can be secreted by a cell, taken up by another cell via mannose 6-phosphate receptors, and shuttled to lysosomes where they can act to reduce stored substrate. Unfortunately for people affected with Sanfilippo B syndrome, NAGLU does not contain sufficient mannose 6-phosphate when expressed recombinantly, so that cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting never take place. We have generated a fusion construct of NAGLU and a portion of insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2). The natural scavenger receptor for IGF2 is the mannose 6-phosphate receptor (though it binds at a different site than does mannose 6- phosphate). Our preliminary in vitro and in vivo data show that recombinant human NAGLU-IGF2 is active, enters cells, and can reduce lysosomal storage with high efficiency. The next step, which this proposal seeks to address, is to determine whether recombinant human NAGLU-IGF2 will improve the Sanfilippo B phenotype, which is one of progressive cognitive deterioration. In this project, we propose to study this potential new therapy in vivo, to determine whether it improves neurobehavior, physical disease, and survival. The results will tell us whether recombinant NAGLU-IGF2 can serve as effective enzyme therapy for this devastating disease. Results may also have implications for gene and cell therapy approaches for Sanfilippo B, which might be made more effective with the use of IGF2-mediated lysosomal targeting."

"9328947","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  High grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), the most lethal gynecologic malignancy, is typically diagnosed after distant metastasis has occurred, and chemoresistance renders current treatments short-lived. Two major knowledge gaps exist in the field: we lack an understanding of early lesions and development of new anticancer drugs. HGSOC has been difficult to research and model due to debate over the most common cell of origin, which is now accepted to be the fallopian tube epithelium (FTE), and because the menstrual cycle plays a role in HGSOC development. No models of the disease previously existed, which incorporate both the fallopian tube and an ovary capable of recapitulating the human menstrual cycle. FemKube, the first female reproductive tract-on-a-chip, was created through a multi-institutional collaboration between the University of Illinois, Northwestern, and Draper Labs to support primary human fallopian tube tissues and murine ovaries, which are engineered to drive a physiologically accurate 28-day human menstrual cycle, in the setting of microfluidic flow. We will leverage this innovative technology to address both issues in the field by utilizing it to investigate early oncogenic events in the fallopian tube and to enhance the preclinical development of a promising new class of natural product chemotherapeutics, Phyllanthusmins (PHYs).  Our collaborative team has demonstrated the ability of FemKube to support growth of human fallopian tissues for the length of an accurately reproduced menstrual cycle. It is hypothesized that the FTE is damaged by secreted factors produced by the ovary during the follicular phase (first half of the menstrual cycle that encompasses follicle maturation), which is restored under the influence of progestins secreted from the corpus luteum (what remains of the follicle after ovulation) in the late luteal phase (second half of the menstrual cycle). Our first aim is to investigate how the cycling ovary impacts HGSOC initiation in the FTE by mapping DNA damage, proliferation, and apoptosis. We will use inhibitors of menstrual cycle hormones and nascent oncogenic mediators, such as known DNA mutators, inflammatory and growth factors, reactive oxygen species neutralizers and tumor suppressors, to mechanistically study HGSOC initiation in the FemKube system.  Our second aim seeks to incorporate our ability to culture primary human tissues in the FemKube system into the preclinical drug development pipeline. With the help our collaborators at the Ohio State University, we have developed a promising class of compounds derived from natural products, PHYs, with nanomolar potency on HGSOC cell lines in vitro. We will confirm PHY's apoptotic and anticancer abilities in vitro. We will demonstrate their efficacy on tumors ex vivo in the FemKube system and benchmark our findings against gold standard in vivo chemotherapeutic assays in mice. Overall, the introduction of FemKube technology will answer previously inaccessible questions on HGSOC initiation and enhance the drug development pipeline, thereby addressing key gaps in current ovarian cancer research."
"9376032","Abstract Given the multifactorial pathophysiological cascades involved in traumatic brain injury (TBI), it is difficult if not impossible to have a thorough view of the molecular mechanisms underlying the complexity of this pathology based on limited information derived from conventional approaches that examine isolated molecular events. This complexity becomes a larger limiting factor for the design of strategies to diagnose and predict the outcome of mild TBI (mTBI) which has a less defined symptomatology. Genomic profiling is emerging as a powerful tool to retrieve fundamental information about gene regulatory mechanisms that govern the mTBI pathology and its diversion towards other neurological disorders. However, genomic studies of mTBI have been primarily based on the use of whole brain regions comprised of heterogeneous cell types that mask information from the most vulnerable cell types which are crucial drivers of the pathogenesis. The unique aspect of our approach is to determine the genomic signatures of mTBI at single-cell resolution as cells are the basic units of biological structure and function. We will use state-of-the-art Drop-seq technology that empowers us to capture the transcriptome of thousands of individual brain cells in parallel to accurately define cell types based on aggregate genomic features and, more importantly, to identify cell-type specific gene markers of mTBI, which are generally hidden to the eyes of conventional approaches. We propose experiments to classify all the cell types in the hippocampus (one of the main action sites of TBI) in an unbiased manner and to assess the vulnerability of each cell type to mTBI using single-cell transcriptome profiles (Aim 1). In addition, we will define cell-type specific signatures of genes that could characterize main events involved in our rodent model of mTBI with varying severity at different time points post-TBI (Aim 2). We expect to retrieve novel cell types defined by the effects of mTBI, and their associated deterministic gene markers in the hippocampus. In doing so, we expect to unravel the fundamental, cell specific gene signatures that can be used as biomarkers of mTBI in a data-driven, unbiased manner. Our findings will derive clues to the underlying molecular events and pathways driving the cellular and functional remodeling. This proposal offers the unique opportunity to synergize efforts by combining the expertise of Dr. Fernando Gomez-Pinilla in TBI and the expertise of Dr. Xia Yang in genomics, bioinformatics, and systems biology of complex disorders. The overall goal of the proposal is to elaborate on an innovative research strategy that can provide a comprehensive understanding of the mTBI pathology at single cell resolution, which can be used to empower patient diagnosis, and to design a new line of strategies to redirect the courses of TBI and overcome subsequent neurological disorders."
"9268082","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant) Understanding how neural regions interact, both during behavioral tasks and spontaneously (e.g. at rest), is critical for studying healthy and disordered brain networks. Many studies have measured hemodynamic brain activity (fMRI), but the neural basis of hemodynamic functional connectivity remains unclear. For spontaneous functional connectivity in particular, hemodynamic measures of functional connectivity are in a low frequency (< 0.1 Hz) range while the corresponding networks found by electrophysiological measures show distinct frequency selectivity at a much faster time scale (>1 Hz). A critical conundrum for understanding spontaneous functional connectivity is: do these slow hemodynamic fluctuations arise simply as the result of the non- specific temporal smoothing that results from the slow biomechanical response of blood vessels (e.g. the hemodynamic impulse response function) or do these slow hemodynamic oscillations reflect frequency-specific neural oscillations (e.g. specific neural sub-types) or specifically low frequency neural events? Furthermore, do these spontaneous neural-vascular relationships arise from the same mechanisms as evoked brain activity or do these involve a different subset of neural interactions? Previous studies have been limited by inferring the neural underpinning of hemodynamic functional connectivity based on general spatial overlap of circuits, only examining temporal correspondence between measures, or being unable to examine the neural response across distributed circuits. We will use the approach of simultaneous multimodal recordings of electrophysiological and hemodynamic fluctuations via concurrent magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). In conjunction with concurrent fNIRS/fMRI/EEG, this innovative multimodal approach affords a unique opportunity to simultaneously record and co-localize neural and hemodynamic activity during interregional communication in the human brain, overcoming many limitations of previous studies. The objective in this application is to describe the correspondence between the neural and hemodynamic signals during both spontaneous and evoked tasks in two important brain networks, a circuit in the somatomotor network and one in the frontoparietal network. We propose the following two specific aims: 1. Define the regional relationship between the hemodynamic activity and the spectral properties of spontaneous and evoked electrophysiological activity. 2. Define the spatiotemporal circuit-level relationship between spontaneous and evoked hemodynamic and electrophysiological activity. The significance of this work is that its successful completion will provide a direct connection between the neural and hemodynamic underpinnings of two critical brain circuit phenomena: spontaneous brain activity and interregional communication. Determining the electrophysiological underpinnings of the brain's hemodynamic functional organization is a key step in understanding the biological basis and interpretation of hemodynamic measures of functional connectivity."
"9346233","In the United States, over 2.2 million people are incarcerated. While these numbers are alarming,  even more distressing is the rapid growth in the number of mentally ill individuals caught in this  system. Within any given year, approximately 73% of females and 55% of males in jail will  experience a mental health problem. This results in the criminal justice system serving as a de  facto mental health treatment facility for hundreds of thousands of individuals, despite  constrained funding and a paucity of qualified providers and interventions. More than one in five  jails have no access to mental health services. There is strong evidence that technology-enabled interventions for the treatment of mood disorders  are efficacious and cost effective. Technology-enabled mental health care has many strengths,  including the ability to deliver treatment reliably, increase privacy for those seeking services,  and provide a scalable evidence-based intervention at a lower cost than traditional face-to-face  services. Edovo has previously developed secure tablet hardware, protected networks and a learning management  system that deliver static content in the areas of academic, job skill, and life skill programming  to those incarcerated. The aim of this project is to develop and demonstrate the feasibility of a  dynamic intervention for the treatment of inmates with mood disorders utilizing the Edovo system. A  user centered design approach will be used to modify existing evidence-based, technology-enabled  mood interventions to be appropriate for the incarcerated population. Software will be modified to  run the intervention on the existing Edovo system. The resulting intervention will be tested in a  sample of inmates for an initial clinical signal. The development of such a technology would help  correctional facilities more effectively meet their treatment requirements and rehabilitation  goals, and help Edovo more successfully commercialize through a stronger evidence base for impact  on mental health and increased scores on responses to Requests for Proposal."
"9335547","Cell infection by animal viruses is controlled by their structural proteins and by variation in those structures. Viral proteins interact with host cell receptors, leading to binding, uptake and intracellular trafficking, while interactions with host antibodies may neutralize infection with varying efficiencies. Many functions of viral structural proteins are still not fully understood, including the structural effects of receptor or antibody binding in controlling infection. Here we will continue to investigate those processes using parvovirus capsids as a model. The viruses being studied include canine parvovirus (CPV), which arose as a new pandemic pathogen due to changes in its interaction with the host transferrin receptor type-1 (TfR). The parvovirus capsids also bind antibodies to several epitopes with significant variation in the resulting neutralization. In the previous period we have generated important new information about the structures and functions of capsids, the roles of TfR variants in infection, and the binding of antibodies. The tools developed allow us to manipulate each component in order to understand how they control virus infection. The studies are presented as three complementary Aims: Aim 1. Explain the structural role of the receptor in the infectious process, and the effects of host- specific structural variation. Define the interactions of TfR apical domain mutants and variants with the complementary viral capsid structures, and explain how those control cell infection and viral host tropisms. Show how the receptor binding alters the capsid to prepare it for infection. Use other ligands to bind the capsid to result in endocytosis, and investigate the effects on infection. Aim 2. Define the capsid-mediated processes and structural variation required for cell infection. We have identified single changes in different capsid structures that prevent infection, and some of those appear to control key variation required for successful cell infection. We will define how those structures control the capsid functions, in particular the sources of specific intra-capsid cleavages. We will determine the high resolution structures of capsids with altered infectious properties using cryo-EM approaches. Those sites are asymmetric, as they occur in only ~10% of the capsid proteins. We will therefore use a variety of structural and biochemical approaches to study those structures and to explain their functions in the processes of cell infection. Aim 3. Analyze the interactions of antibodies with the capsid to explain the mechanisms of binding, neutralization, and antibody escape. Use high-resolution structures of capsid-Fab complexes to explain antibody-binding specificity, and also to understand how those interactions result in neutralization in some cases but not others. Use antibody and capsid mutations to alter the binding, neutralization, and cross- reactivity of antibodies, to define the functional interactions between capsids, antibodies, and receptors."
"9479934","PROJECT SUMMARY Reactive oxygen species (ROS), such as H2O2 derived from NADPH oxidase (NOX) act as signaling molecules to promote VEGF-induced angiogenesis in ECs and post-ischemic neovascularization. Fundamental question remains ?how diffusible H2O2 signal can be efficiently transmitted to promote therapeutic angiogenesis.? Signaling function of ROS is through oxidation of reactive Cys residues to generate ?Cysteine sulfenic acid (Cys- OH)? which is involved in disulfide bond formation and redox signaling. Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) functions as oxidase, reductase and isomerase depending on redox environment. ?PDIA1? is a major PDI isoform with four reactive Cys residues in redox active domains. Given redox properties of PDI, PDI may function as redox sensor in ROS-dependent VEGF signaling to enhance therapeutic angiogenesis and maintain endothelial metabolic states. Preliminary Data found that PDIA1+/- mice or diabetes mice with reduced PDIA1 expression show impaired reparative angiogenesis, indicating in vivo significance of PDIA1. In primary ECs, VEGF stimulation increases Cys-OH formation of various proteins, which was markedly decreased by PDIA1 siRNA. Experiments using 2D gel assay and searching for binding partner of PDIA1 discovered that PDIA1 functions as a redox sensor in ROS-dependent VEGF signaling to promote Cys oxidation/activation of AMPK, a key regulator of cell metabolism and angiogenesis, via disulfide bond formation. Moreover, in quiescent basal ECs, PDIA1 knockdown unexpectedly induced mitochondrial fragmentation and EC senescence without inducing ER stress via increasing Cys oxidation of Drp1, a key fission GTPase. We thus hypothesize that PDIA1 functions as key redox adaptor/reductase for Drp1 to maintain mitochondrial dynamics in quiescent ECs as well as redox sensor when it is Cys oxidized to transduce VEGF-induced H2O2 signal to promote oxidative activation of AMPK via disulfide bond formation, thereby enhancing endothelial metabolism and angiogenesis in ECs. This is required for full neovascularization in ischemic vascular disease. Aim 1 will determine the molecular mechanisms by which PDIA1 senses VEGF-induced H2O2 signal to promote EC metabolism and angiogenesis via oxidative activation of AMPK, which is impaired in diabetic ECs. Aim2 will examine whether PDIA1 maintains mitochondrial dynamics via binding to Drp1 to keep it in reduced/inactive state in quiescent ECs, thereby preventing mitochondrial fragmentation and ECs dysfunction in diabetes. Aim 3 will determine the in vivo role of endothelial PDIA1 in ROS-dependent reparative neovascularization, which is impaired in diabetes. We will use biotin-labelled Cys-OH trapping probe; BiFC-based molecular protein interaction imaging; mitochondrial dynamics imaging; EC-specific PDIA1-/- or diabetic mice; and gene transfer of EC-targeted Cys oxidation defective mutants of PDIA1, AMPK and Drp1. Our proposal will provide novel insights into Cys reduced/oxidized proteins and Cys oxidation-mediated molecular interaction as potential therapeutic targets for treatment of ischemic cardiovascular metabolic diseases."
"9301427","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Assisted living (AL) is the fastest growing segment of the long-term care industry and preferred greatly over the more costly and medical nursing home environment. Informal caregivers play a critical role in residents' ability move to and remain in these non-medical residential care settings and also affect residents' and caregivers' quality of life. Our recent work shows that most AL residents have care convoys that include family and friends and evolve in response to resident decline and family, friend, and facility transitions. In recent years, however, AL residents have grown older and frailer and require higher levels of care, a trend that is apt to alter the demand for informal care and the configuration of care roles. Informal caregivers typically are adult children and occasionally spouses, who may have multiple competing demands and may be experiencing their own health problems. Some residents lack these traditional helpers and may rely on other family and friends or have no one. Despite the changing needs of this population and variations in the availability of support, as well as the significant public health and policy implications of learnig how to develop collaborative care partnerships in AL, research has yet to address fully the complexity of informal care in these settings, particularly how it is organized among and between care partners and unfolds over time. The overall goal of this five-year study is to learn how to support informal care and care convoys in AL in ways that promote residents' ability to age in place with optimal resident and informal and formal caregiver quality of life. The specific aims are: (1) To understand how informal care in AL is experienced, organized, and negotiated within care convoys over time; (2) To understand the factors that influence informal care work in AL and how they operate to support or hinder the development of care partnerships that promote aging in place with optimal resident and informal and formal caregiver quality of life; and (3) To determine successful strategies for building care partnerships in AL. This study will use participant observation and informal and formal interviewing in 8 AL settings that vary by key individual-, facility-, and community-level factors, collecting data in 2 waves of 4 sites each Fifty residents diverse in age, marital and parental statuses, race and ethnicity, and cognitive and physical functioning will be purposively selected, interviewed, and followed over 24-months. Their convoy members also will be identified, interviewed, and followed over the same time period. Following residents' care convoys prospectively will enhance understandings of care as a dynamic process and shed light on the ways families and friends negotiate amongst themselves and with other convoy members, including paid care workers. Grounded Theory Method will guide data collection and analysis, which will provide significant insight into the car process. This knowledge will help us identify strategies for developing and supporting collaborative care partnerships between informal and formal caregivers and recipients."
"9293671","PROJECT ABSTRACT The long-term goal of this project is to understand how embryos prevent and correct errors during early development, enabling them to develop normally in spite of challenges. It focuses on two aspects of early embryonic error correction, and uses zebrafish as a vertebrate model. First, how do embryos respond to and recover from DNA damage? Previous work identified a novel gene expression program that seems to be a response to DNA damage specifically in early embryos. Experiments will identify the conditions that activate this program, what happens to cells after its activation, and the role each gene plays in the program. Second, how do embryos recover from improper patterning? squint mutant embryos initially pattern too little mesendoderm due to reduced Nodal signaling, but they correct their patterning during gastrulation and develop into phenotypically normal adults. Experiments will test how patterning is extended in these mutants, where the rescued cells originate from, and then apply single-cell RNAseq to determine whether corrected cells differ long-term from wild-type cells. These aims will show mechanisms used in embryos to correct patterning errors and respond to DNA damage, and determine whether error correction leaves persistent differences in the embryo. Lastly, these data will shed light on how some perturbations could result in partially penetrant birth defects and potentially suggest methods to reduce their penetrance."
"9270616","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over a third of individuals with bipolar spectrum disorders (BP) are treated exclusively in primary care settings, and yet, primary care providers (PCPs) are ill-equipped to manage this complex and disabling illness. Medications, which can be prescribed by PCPs, hasten recovery from illness and improve long-term course of illness for those with BP, but relapse and residual symptoms are common when individuals are treated with pharmacotherapy alone. Best practices treatment for BP includes adjunctive, BP-specific psychotherapy as a key element of effective care. And yet, evidence-based BP-specific psychotherapies that engage and modify targets specific to BP are typically unavailable in primary care settings.  Online interventions have the potential to overcome barriers to accessing evidence- based psychosocial treatments for BP in primary care. In other settings and with other populations, effectiveness of online interventions improved when human support/coaching (clinical helpers; CH) via text, email, and telephone was added to the intervention.  Interpersonal and Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT) is a BP-specific psychotherapy that uses a problem-solving approach to help individuals regularize their social rhythms in order to entrain underlying disturbances in circadian and sleep/wake regulation, factors that are increasingly recognized as playing important roles in the pathogenesis of BP. Its primary behavioral target is regularity of daily routines such as sleep/wake cycle and mealtimes. This construct is measured by the validated Social Rhythm Metric (SRM).  The current application seeks to develop and conduct initial testing of an online version of IPSRT (i-IPSRT) for use in primary care. We will (1) evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of supported and unsupported online psychotherapy interventions for BP in primary care (i- IPSRT and i-IPSRT plus CH) compared to Control Condition (CC), (2) examine whether i- IPSRT and i-IPSRT + CH engages its primary behavioral target as measured by the SRM, and (3) explore the impact of i-IPSRT, i-IPSRT + CH, and CC on symptoms and functioning over 12 weeks. Information from this study will inform a larger trial to test the effectiveness of these approaches in primary care. The public health impact of developing an effective, technology- enabled approach to delivering evidenced-based psychotherapy that targets specific, modifiable, behaviors for BP in primary care settings is substantial, offering the potential to reduce illness burden and improve outcomes for individuals with this disabling disorder."
"9270491","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The risk of respiratory diseases increases significantly with advancing age. Elderly people are more prone to lung infections such as influenza and pneumonia and chronic illnesses such as asthma and obstructive pulmonary disease. The underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Airways are continuously being exposed to a wide variety of inhaled antigens majority of which are harmless. Dendritic cells (DCs) are key innate immune cells which are critical for initiation and generation of an effective immune response against invading pathogens as well as for maintaining tolerance against harmless inhaled antigens. Vitamin A metabolite, Retinoic acid (RA) plays a major role in inducing tolerance in respiratory DCs. Our preliminary data suggests that DCs from aged subjects are impaired in their response to retinoic acid resulting in loss of tolerance. Furthermore, aged DCs also affect the functions of airway epithelial cells to induce the secretion of various chemokines such as CXCL-10, CCL-26, and CCL-20 which can attract other cells into the airways and enhance inflammation. Therefore, we hypothesize that DCs from aged are impaired in their capacity to maintain tolerance at the respiratory surfaces which results in chronic inflammation and remodeling of the airways and increases the susceptibility of the elderly to respiratory illnesses. Our specific aims for the proposal are -1) to investigate the mechanisms responsible for impaired response of DCs from elderly to RA; 2) to determine the functional consequences of reduced RA metabolism in aged DCs; 3) to investigate the effect of altered RA response of aged DC on DC-epithelial cell crosstalk. Aged population is increasing worldwide and a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the increased susceptibility of the elderly to respiratory diseases is required for design of novel and more effective treatment."
"9324680","Project Summary This supplemental request supports work to expand the National Xenopus Resource (NXR) through the renovation of approximately 850 sq ft of space to allow for live animals to be maintained in that space. The NXR is the national stock center for Xenopus laevis and Xenopus tropicalis animals and was founded in 2010. The need for additional space stems from the increase in genome editing technology that has revolutionized biomedical research, permitting the creation of mutant Xenopus. This new space will be used to maintain, breed and distribute mutant animals created by the Xenopus community, allowing access to these animals to all researchers. This is a critical renovation since this is the only Xenopus stock center. Newly funded research projects have proposed to create Xenopus models of human disease using genome editing, and these animals will be housed in this new space. Over the last few years there has been increased demand form the Xenopus community for custom mutant lines that are produced by the NXR and the current infrastructure is unable to support these additional mutant animals. This application requests funds to support the renovation of the space (HVAC, water, electrical, etc.) for the new Xenopus housing systems; the new equipment for housing he frogs has already been budgeted in other NIH-funded grants."
"9206066","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Stroke is a common affliction among veterans, and treatments are few. Work by our labs and those of our collaborators' have focused on the protective potential of heat shock proteins, namely, the highly inducible 70 kD heat shock protein (HSP70). HSP70 appears to have cytoprotective properties by nature of its chaperone functions, presumably leading to enhancement of nascent protein folding and prevention of protein aggregation. However, work in related fields has shown that HSPs appear to positively influence many aspects of ischemic cell death. We previously showed that overexpression of HSP70 or its pharmacological induction protects by inhibiting inflammation and upregulating the anti-apoptotic protein, Bcl-2. Others have shown the HSP70 blocks apoptosis by preventing cytochrome c release from the mitochondria or inhibiting caspase activation. Through collaborative work with Dr. Jong Eun Lee (Yonsei University, S. Korea), we identified dynamin as one protein substantially suppressed by HSP70 overexpression. Dynamin is a GTPase involved in receptor- mediated endocytosis through detaching clathrin-coated vesciles from the plasma membrane. Its role in ischemic brain cell death is completely unknown, but has been implicated in facilitating apoptosis by trafficking the death receptor Fas to the cell surface. In this application, we propose to further explore these observations that HSP70 protects the brain against stroke by interfering with dynamin export of Fas, and to address the implications of dynamin as a therapeutic target. Specific aim 1: Determine whether dynamin inhibition is protective, and if its suppression is linked to protection by HSP70. Specific aim 2: Determine whether there is a link between dynamin, fas and dynamin inhibition by HSP70. Specific aim 3: Determine how HSP70 regulates dynamin expression and/or function."
"9275294","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):          Neisseria gonorrhoeae is a human pathogen that causes the sexually transmitted infection termed gonorrhea. The yearly incidence of gonorrhea worldwide (>100 million cases) is a major public health problem, which is compounded by the emergence of strains resistant to multiple antibiotics. The problem of antibiotic resistance expressed by certain clinical isolates has been made more worrisome recently with reports of strains expressing decreased susceptibility or resistance to the third generation cephalosporins (ceftriaxone and cefixime) that have been used for empiric therapy of gonorrhea in the United States. Symptomatic gonorrhea is largely due to the host's inflammatory response, which can result in severe complications for men and women. Invasive gonorrhea in the female patient can be particularly acute resulting in severe gynecologic consequences. This Merit Award renewal is dedicated to understanding the genetics and molecular control of an important modification of the gonococcal outer membrane that contributes to the ability of gonococci to resist certain mediators (complement and cationic antimicrobial peptides [CAMPs]) of innate host defense. This modification consists of the attachment of phosphoethanolamine (PEA) to the lipid A of lipooligosaccharide by an enzyme termed LptA. During the past funding period we showed that null mutations in the gene (lptA) encoding LptA rendered gonococci hyper-susceptible to complement and CAMPs, depressed the pro- inflammatory response induced by gonococci and decreased bacterial fitness during an experimental infection of the lower genital tract of female mice. Further, we uncovered a multi-layered, integrated and complex regulatory system that modulates lptA expression and, as a consequence, PEA decoration of lipid A, gonococcal susceptibility to CAMPs, in vivo fitness of gonococci and inflammation. This system is the focus of this renewal application. The overall regulatory system consists of multiple promoters within an operon for lptA expression, a phase variable polynucleotide repeat sequence within the lptA coding sequence that can cause truncation of LptA at high frequencies and the gene-activating capacity of a DNA-binding protein termed MisR. During the requested funding period, these regulatory processes will be defined and their impact on CAMP resistance will be determined. The studies embodied in Specific Aim 1 will define and characterize the promoters used for lptA expression, their differential use and response to sub-lethal levels of antimicrobials. Transcriptional factors that modulate use of these promoters will be identified so as to understand how lptA expression is controlled at the transcriptional level. Additionally, the phase variable production of LptA will be defined in laboratory-maintained and recent clinical strains. The studies embodied in Specific Aim 2 are dedicated to understanding the mechanisms by which MisR regulates lptA expression and how this control system influences gonococcal resistance to CAMPs and production of unique lipid A structures. The successful completion of the proposed work will significantly advance our knowledge regarding how gonococci can evade host defenses and modulate pro-inflammatory responses through the use of gene control systems. Importantly, the results should also provide important insights for the future development of novel antimicrobial agents and therapeutic strategies that can be used in the treatment of gonorrhea."
"9271083","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The promise of skeletal regenerative medicine to mitigate age-related bone loss and support fracture healing critically depends on the ability to manipulate the biological properties of osteogenic progenitor cells. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms control cell fate determination and phenotype- specific gene expression when progenitor cells commit to the osteoblast lineage. MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) and epigenetic regulators (EpiRegs) regulate osteogenic differentiation by controlling the expression of TFs. Therefore, this proposal will focus on miR-TF-EpiReg circuits that control osteoblast differentiation. The central hypothesis of the overall project is that osteoblast differentiation is controlled by miRNAs- TF-EpiReg circuits. Based on recent preliminary data, this proposal has evolved to address the specific working model that miR155 suppresses while miR101 stimulates osteoblast maturation by targeting distinct TFs and EpiRegs, respectively. Maximal expression of miR155 occurs in undifferentiated osteoblasts where we predict that miR155 - together with co-regulated miRNAs - controls a group of common TF targets that attenuate osteoblast maturation. For miR101, we observed that it is maximal in mature osteoblasts and targets a critical epigenetic regulator, Ezh2, which methylates histone H3. Our preliminary data show that Ezh2 expression is inversely regulated with miR101 and is critical for normal skeletal development, based on our phenotypic characterization of a conditional Ezh2 null mouse model. We will determine (i) the biological significance of miR155 in a novel miR/TF circuit that suppresses osteoblast differentiation in cell culture and in transgenic mouse models that conditionally express miR155 (Aim 1), as well as (ii) the importance of a miR101-Ezh2 axis during osteoblast differentiation in vivo and ex vivo by conditional expression of miR101 in transgenic mice (Aim 2). Upon completion of the primary objectives of this proposal, my long term goals are to examine the molecular consequences of miRNA dependent TF-EpiReg networks using RNASeq and ChiP-Seq approaches to define new drug-sensitive regulatory pathways. These studies should ultimately lead to the development of osteotropic drugs that could become new bone anabolic therapies. This future work as independent investigator would leverage my combined expertise in pharmacology, epigenetics and mouse bone biology that I acquired during doctoral and post-doctoral training."
"9271087","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The role of NMDAR in the pathophysiological process of schizophrenia Abstract  Schizophrenia (SZ) is increasingly recognized as a neurodevelopmental disorder with cognitive impairments often preceding the onset of psychosis, while the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) has long been associated with learning and memory processes, neurodevelopment, and SZ. Yet, the cause of the cognitive deficits and what initiates the pathological process are incompletely understood. Given the importance of NMDARs for cognitive functions, it is likely that NMDAR mis-regulation/dysfunction plays a critical role in the pathological process of SZ. In the past two decades, a remarkably convergent observation across several animal models of SZ and human postmortem studies is the phenomenon of NMDAR hypofunction. However, the vast majority of SZ- related research has focused on NMDAR function in adults, leaving the role of NMDARs during brain development unexplored. An important next step is to identify the mechanisms that cause NMDAR dysfunction with different insults during development. To address this issue, we have conducted some pilot studies. Our preliminary data indicated that along with working memory and learning deficits, protein levels of NMDAR subunits are significantly reduced in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, starting from the juvenile period and becoming more prominent during the adolescent period. Furthermore, there is a clear alteration in NMDAR-mediated current in the prefrontal neurons in both methylazoxymethanol (MAM)-exposed rat and DISC1 mutant mouse models during the early stage of development. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that NMDAR hypofunction begins in the early stage of postnatal development and progresses until adulthood. This process is universal to different animal models. Correcting NMDAR hypofunction in the early stage (juvenile period) would be effective to restore glutamatergic synaptic transmission and thus to rescue cognitive deficits. Using a combination of molecular, biochemical, and physiological techniques, along with behavioral tests, in Aim 1 we will determine the time course of NMDAR mis-expression and dysfunction in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during postnatal development; as well as testing learning and memory functions in both MAM-exposed rats and inducible DISC1 mutant mice. In Aim 2 we will investigate the mechanisms underlying NMDAR dysfunction during postnatal development, focusing on transcriptional repression by epigenetic remodeling and signaling pathways involved in NMDAR downregulation. In Aim 3 we will determine whether pharmacologically correcting NMDAR hypofunction in the early stage (juvenile period) of development is able to restore NMDAR functions and thus rescue learning and memory deficits in MAM-exposed rats and DISC1 mutant mice. We believe that these experiments will elucidate the progression of NMDAR hypofunction, provide mechanistic insight into its cause, and generate possible new avenues for therapeutic intervention. Furthermore, the results would provide an interesting platform for exploring how early NMDAR hypofunction contributes to cognitive deficits in SZ and will address the very important conceptual question of whether early stage treatment is able to prevent the progression or reverse the cognitive deficits associated with this disease."
"9206078","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           The success of the adaptive immune system depends upon the rapid generation of effector cells and the maintenance of memory to the antigens and pathogens previously encountered. The germinal center (GC) is the site of somatic hypermutation of antibodies, antibody class switching to IgG, and a central source of memory B cells and thus is critical for effective humoral immunity. The formation of GCs within secondary lymphoid organs after challenge with protein immunizations or viral infections is driven by specialized CD4+ T follicular helper (TFH) cells that interact with antigen-specific B cells to initiate the GC. GC-dependent neutralizing antibodies (Abs) that develop are critical for viral control and defense against secondary infection and are utilized as biomarkers for the efficacy of influenza vaccines. Thus, there is a  significant need to understand the pathways that lead to differentiation of TFH, GCs, and memory B cells. The cognate interactions between MHC class II positive antigen presenting cells (APC) and antigen-specific CD4+ T cells required for TFH differentiation, the GC reaction, and memory B cell development in different settings and sites remain poorly described. To address this question, we developed a series of mice with altered expression of MHC class II on dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells and examined the immune response to model protein antigens and viral infection. Our preliminary results show that: 1. TFH differentiation is a multi-step process in which conventional DCs are critical for initial priming events but B cells are necessary for imparting the epigenetic changes that mediate complete effector potential; 2. Altering the timing of secondary B cell-T cell interactions preserves the differentiation of TFH bu inhibits the GC response; 3. In contrast to current models, T cell- dependent memory B cell differentiation can be preserved in the absence of robust GC responses; 4. APC requirements for TFH differentiation are relaxed following viral infection. These results lead to our hypothesis  that variable spatial and temporal control of TFH development, the germinal center reaction, and B cell memory formation can be manipulated to impact the response to viral infection or immunization. In the current proposal, we will utilize a number of murine models to dissect the APC-T cell interactions that regulate TFH differentiation and the GC response following influenza infection. First, we will define the MHCII- dependent cognate interactions that regulate clearance and protection from influenza A. Mice with limited expression of MHCII will be vaccinated against or infected with Influenza A. We will determine which APCs process and present individual T cell epitopes recognized by effector T cells and TFH and when TFH differentiation is sufficient to drive GC responses and the development of B cell memory. We hypothesize that DCs initiate TFH differentiation but secondary Ag presentation from B cells is necessary to imprint the lineage. To advance this model, we will examine genome wide histone modifications of the TFH lineage induced by different APCs. These data will generate an epigenetic and transcriptional roadmap of the humoral response and define how individual APCs synergize to fix the functional lineages. Finally, we will utilize our models to determine if pharmacologic manipulation with improved adjuvant or epigenetic modification enhances vaccination. Completion of these Aims will provide significant insight into the biology of TFH differentiation and differentiation of the germinal center and B cell memory responses during influenza vaccination and infection. We will identify cellular and molecular targets that regulate humoral immunity and protection to guide future investigations to enhance the immune response to a virus that is problematic for Veterans."
"9383687","Accurately balancing the competing risks of interventional treatment and natural history ? primarily intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) ? is necessary for optimal management of patients harboring unruptured brain arteriovenous malformations (bAVMs). As a class, unruptured patients are at higher risk for treatment-related injury but at lower risk for ICH. Accordingly, treatment of unruptured bAVMs?half of all cases? is becoming increasingly controversial. Results from A Randomized Trial of Unruptured Brain AVMs (ARUBA, NCT00389181) showed higher stroke and death rates in patients receiving intervention (either surgery, embolization and/or radiosurgery) compared to non-intervention. However, the ARUBA trial was stopped early and has generated strong criticisms from the interventional community expressing doubts about the generalizability of findings due to the potential for selection bias in a randomized trial, underrepresentation of cases from the US, atypical treatment patterns, and short follow-up of 33 months that leaves the question unanswered over patients' entire lifetimes. Observational cohort studies of bAVM clinical course afford an opportunity to address important gaps and previous criticisms of randomized data to help guide treatment decisions. The overarching goal of this project is to identify novel risk factors for ICH in the untreated course of unruptured bAVMs, to estimate risk with precision, and to create personalized risk prediction models for patients. We propose to conduct a large, multicenter study of bAVM cohorts with longitudinal data to identify robust risk factors for ICH in the natural history course and to causally test the effect of treatment on long-term outcomes in unruptured bAVM. Aim 1 will identify predictors of ICH and poor outcome in unruptured bAVM patients using a systematic approach to identify and combine data from collaborating cohorts. We will perform a large individual patient data meta-analysis to more accurately quantify traditional and novel risk factors. Aim 2 will test whether long-term outcomes differ by treatment using observational data and sophisticated epidemiological approaches for causal inference and unbiased estimates, including Cox regression with time- varying covariate, propensity-score analysis, and marginal structural models. Aim 3 will test whether long- term outcomes differ by treatment using randomized data and will also compare results to observational data to address low external validity of randomized data due to provider biases, exclusion criteria, or atypical treatment patterns. Aim 4 will build and validate risk prediction models and provide a novel tool for calculating individualized risks. The proposed multicenter consortium project will provide important and comprehensive characterization of the untreated and treated course for unruptured bAVM patients that will be a useful resource for clinicians planning management and assessing current and future interventions. Observational approaches using large datasets and sophisticated statistical approaches are the only feasible way of informing and improving unruptured bAVM patient outcomes in the near future."

"9275367","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Excessive alcohol use can cause structural and functional abnormalities of the brain and this has significant health, social and economic impact. Chronic alcohol abuse induces dementia which is associated with morphological, neurophysiological and biochemical changes in the central nervous system (CNS). The most devastating feature of brain damage following chronic alcohol abuse is neurodegeneration. The underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Chronic alcohol consumption is often accompanied by the deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1). Thiamine deficiency (TD) can damage the CNS. TD in humans may results from chronic alcohol exposure, genetic background, aging or nutritional status. The relationship between thiamine status and neuron susceptibility to alcohol- induced neurodegeneration, however, remains unclear. Autophagy is a lysosomal pathway involved in the turnover of cellular macromolecules and organelles. It provides the cells with an alternative source of intracellular building blocks and energy, thereby enhancing cell survival during nutrient deficiency or stress conditions. We hypothesize that TD may inhibit the autophagic pathways and impair this cellular self-protection mechanism. As a result, neurons are more susceptible to alcohol- induced neurodegeneration after chronic TD. Three specific aims are proposed to test this hypothesis. We will first investigate whether the status of thiamine content determines neuron susceptibility to alcohol-induced neurodegeneration. We will next characterize the effect TD/alcohol on autophagy in the brain. Finally, we will determine the role of autophagy in alcohol/TD interaction and alcohol-induced neurodegeneration. As a unit, the proposal will elucidate the relationship between TD and neuron susceptibility to alcohol neurotoxicity and provide a novel insight into the mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced neurodegeneration."
"9262974","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We are studying the basis for increased tuberculosis (TB) susceptibility in diabetes mellitus (DM). The global population-attributable TB risk conferred by DM equals that of AIDS. Diabetes is a leading cause of acquired TB susceptibility in India and China, which have rapidly rising rates of DM on top of already high rates of TB. Major findings in work supported by HL081149 are that mice with chronic hyperglycemia, modeling DM, are more susceptible to TB and have a delayed innate response to aerosol Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) challenge which is followed by dysregulated and excessive T cell activation. In the last 4 years of this project we discovered that alveolar macrophages (AM?) from diabetic mice have reduced expression of the receptors MARCO and CD14 that are involved in the recognition of the Mtb cell wall component trehalose dimycolate. This may explain the delayed innate response in vivo. We also discovered that chronic hyperglycemia causes RAGE-dependent pre-activation of naïve T cells that we attribute to chromatin decondensation. This may explain the excess T cell cytokine production characteristic of TB in diabetic mice and people. In the competing renewal we will investigate the mechanistic basis for the delayed innate response to Mtb in diabetic mice and the effects of diabetes on T cell expansion and exhaustion during TB (using retrogenic mice). We plan novel studies using Mtb mutants as sensors of the bacterial environment in diabetic vs non-diabetic hosts with TB. This provides a unique perspective to understand how changes in cellular immunity cause by diabetes impact bacterial fitness. Building on evidence that diabetes-associated dyslipidemias also impact TB defense, we will apply the same experimental approaches to investigate protective immunity in mice with elevated cholesterol or elevated triglycerides plus free fatty acids, with or without comorbid diabetes. This models type 2 DM, the predominant form in people. Our goal is to generate fundamental knowledge about TB susceptibility in diabetes that can be translated to new treatments. To that end, we will investigate the impact of the host- directed therapy candidate metformin on TB defense in the context of diabetes. This will enhance understanding of the protective mechanism of metformin while at the same time revealing pathways linked to TB susceptibility in diabetes. Despite its significance, the impact of diabetes and dyslipidemias on TB defense has received little attention from basic scientists. We are addressing a major gap in knowledge and at the same time using our models to reveal fundamental elements of the host-pathogen interaction in TB."
"9269968","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Aging populations have become a key target for therapeutics developers, particularly for indications impacting cognitive function. Conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia affect the quality of life of aging Americans, largely due to their impact on cognitive function, with insufficient therapeutic options. Recent reports indicate that early identification of at-risk individuals may help to slow progression and onset of cognitive decline. Thus, new cognitive tests, capable of screening patients for mild or moderate cognitive decline associated with the earliest stages of neurodegenerative disease, are urgently needed. Tests such as the ADAS-Cog (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive subscale) lack sensitivity to milder forms of cognitive impairment, and are cumbersome and time-consuming to administer and score. Effective screening tests for cognitive impairment must be brief, simple to administer, and automatically scored. These tests must be tailored toward aging populations and demonstrate sensitivity to mild cognitive decline. In order to allow meaningful interpretation of individual's performance, well-powered, demographically-targeted normative studies are essential. Pen and paper testing remains largely the standard for the assessment of cognitive decline. Some recently developed computerized tests have demonstrated improvement in ease of use, data reliability and cost-effectiveness in most demographic groups. In the aging population, however, performance on computerized tests is often poorly correlated with performance on pen-and-paper tests, calling into question the validity of data collected with computerized tests in this population. The Brief Assessment of Cognition (BAC) test battery developed by NeuroCog Trials has been employed in a range of studies associated with cognitive impairment, and has recently been adapted as a computerized test, the BAC App, administered via iPad(r). In our company-funded Phase I Report, we provide details regarding the development of the BAC App, as well as data from our validation study showing a strong correlation between performance on the pen-and-paper BAC and performance on the BAC App in aging adults. These data are extremely encouraging, and we propose to expand the number of tests included in the BAC App. This would allow for greater sensitivity to deficits in episodic memory and spatial working memory, which are among the earliest signs of cognitive decline, particularly in Alzheimer's. Our Phase II program will focus on integrating these new tests into the BAC App, conducting a well-powered normative data study in aging adults in collaboration with Dr. Kathleen Welsh-Bohmer (Duke University), and determining the ability of the BAC App to discern healthy subjects from those experiencing cognitive decline. Successful completion of the Phase II program will enable NeuroCog Trials to offer the BAC App in cognitive decline studies specific to aging populations, a need reflected in both the literature and recent feedback from NeuroCog's customers."
"9330478","PROJECT SUMMARY Translational control refers to the regulation of the protein synthesis machinery. Abnormality in translational control in humans has been implicated in many diseases, including cancer. Translational control in eukaryotes occurs predominantly during cap-dependent initiation, a multi-step process that is composed of: i) 43S ribosomal particle binding close to the 5' cap structure of a messenger RNA (mRNA); ii) 43S scanning toward the mRNA 3' end to locate the start of the coding region; and iii) the binding of the 60S large ribosomal subunit to 43S, which sets the stage for protein synthesis to begin. Kinetic characterization of cap-dependent initiation and its regulation during active translation and protein synthesis is limited due to the lack of appropriate kinetic approaches. We recently developed a single-molecule initiation assay that addressed this technical challenge. Our assay is based on cell extract with fluorescently labeled 43S and 60S ribosomal subunits. By measuring the real-time kinetics of 43S and 60S recruitment to single mRNA molecules, we can obtain important kinetic insights of the initiation process. The goal of the proposed research is to establish a quantitative understanding of cap-dependent initiation kinetics and to delineate the key molecular interactions and regulatory elements that control the initiation kinetics. In Aim 1, we will use our single-molecule observations to i) establish the kinetic scheme of 43S and 60S recruitment, ii) quantify the effect of translation-targeting chemicals, iii) interrogate the differential effect of m7G cap and polyA tail on stimulating 43S/60S binding, and iv) better define the roles of key initiation factors in ribosomal recruitment by depleting or mutating the factors in our extract. In Aim 2, we will measure 43S intrinsic scanning speed on structureless mRNA and the scanning slowing effect of mRNA structures. We will also seek a better understanding of the scanning mechanism by comparing the scanning kinetics of cap-dependent vs. m6A-mediated cap-independent initiation and by mutating eIF3. Lastly, we will study the function of helicases eIF4A and Ded1 in scanning by measuring the consequence of specific helicase depletion on the scanning kinetics for structured mRNAs. These two Aims will improve our understanding of the mechanism of cap-dependent initiation from the aspects of 43S/60S recruitment and scanning, and provide a kinetic perspective of initiation and its control, which is currently missing. The gained insights should facilitate a better understanding of translational control in a broad context."
"9263834","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The goal of this research project proposal is to investigate a novel combination therapy for KRAS-driven non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that involves inhibition of pro-tumorigenic cytokine production. Work from this laboratory identified the JAK kinase inhibitor CYT387 (momelotinib) as a potent inhibitor of the immune signaling kinases TBK1/IKK?, disrupting a cytokine circuit that oncogenic RAS engages to promote tumor cell survival and migration. Although efficacious as single agent therapy in Kras-driven murine lung cancer, combination pathway inhibition with a MEK inhibitor resulted in synergy and prolonged tumor regression in an aggressive mouse model of Kras-p53 driven lung cancer. The broad, long term objective is to perform research at the bench to bedside interface to explore further the mechanistic basis that underlies the synergy of this combination therapy, and to identify additional strategies to enhance response and overcome resistance. A unique aspect of this proposal is that it spans basic and translational research and incorporates analysis of an actual clinical trial impacting patients. Specific aims are to: 1) Explore synergy and resistance to TBK1 and MEK inhibition in murine Kras-driven lung cancer through further genetic and pharmacologic studies. 2) Elucidate the molecular circuitry responsible for TBK1/MEK inhibitor synergy, and 3) Evaluate response and resistance to momelotinib/trametinib combination therapy in a phase 1b/2 clinical trial in human KRAS mutant NSCLC. The use of mouse lung cancer models will facilitate pharmacogenetic and pharmacodynamics studies that will define the specific activities of the momelotinib/trametinib combination. Genetic crosses of conditional TBK1 null or kinase dead mice into the oncogenic Kras-driven lung cancer model, together with selective JAK and MEK inhibitor treatment, will identify the unique role of TBK1 in regulating this autocrine cytokine circuit in vivo. Analysis of momelotinib/trametinib efficacy across Kras, Kras-p53, and Kras-Lkb1 murine lung cancer models will determine genetic modifiers of response and de novo resistance. Further investigation of TBK1 signaling in KRAS-dependent human cancer cell lines in vitro will elucidate the mechanism by which its inhibition leads to feedback activation of MEK-ERK signaling, yielding important biologic insights and a better understanding of TBK1/MEK inhibitor synergy. Finally, the determination of resistance mechanisms that develop in mouse models and in patients will further define the key activities of these inhibitors. Through these complementary studies, the ultimate goal is not only to understand mechanism and target this therapy to the appropriate subgroup of patients, but also to identify additional strategies for combination therapy that leads to durable control of this aggressive disease."
"9282816","Project Summary/Abstract Shared decision making (SDM) is growing in clinical and political importance. Based on a large Cochrane review, the science supporting the assertion that patient decision aids (PtDAs) result in SDM and improve decision outcomes is strong. However, the benefits of real-world use of PtDAs remains unrealized as PtDAs are largely unused in routine health care. Previous attempts at real-world implementation of PtDAs have been characterized by a focus on low-risk decisions in primary care. The problem with this approach is that, since the stakes are so low, busy clinicians perceive PtDAs to be of little value, undermining their implementation. This team's overall goal is to assess real-world effectiveness (Aim 1) and implementation (Aim 2) of patient decision aids (PtDA) for high-risk decisions using the implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) as a model. ICDs are ideal to study because they are common and involve complex trade-offs. While they can prolong lives, they do not improve quality of life (QOL) and come with a host of risks including device failure, inappropriate shocks, shocks (and subsequent suffering) at the end of life, anxiety, depression, and post- traumatic stress disorder. While most patients see prevention of sudden death as desirable, they also prefer to die peacefully in their sleep (which the ICD would try to prevent). In recognition of the personal nature of ICDs, professional guidelines now recommend SDM for eligible patients. This proposal addresses two big problems: 1) a lack of effectiveness data for PtDAs in real world settings, as efficacy trials comprise virtually all of the data supporting PtDAs; and 2) the optimal implementation strategy for PtDAs is unknown. This team has developed a reproducible, sustainable, low-cost strategy to facilitate implementation across diverse clinical settings. This application proposes the DECIDE-ICD trial: a type II effectiveness implementation hybrid trial of three ICD PtDAs. The DECIDE-ICD trial is a 6-site stepped-wedge randomized trial, with implementation guided by normalization process theory and a mixed methods evaluation guided by the RE-AIM framework. The study team has the relationships, infrastructure, and transdisciplinary expertise to execute this project. By simultaneously exploring effectiveness and implementation, this project will provide pragmatic information that will inform a growing national agenda to better involve patients in their health care via SDM."
"9414476","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite recent advances in diabetes therapy, diabetes in the majority of patients is poorly controlled. This failure to achieve optimum glycemic control partly results from the limitations in our understanding of diabetes pathophysiology and gaps in understanding molecular mechanisms of action of conventional treatments. The overall objective (immediate career goal) of this K01 application is to identify the implication of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) non-catalytic activity in type 2 diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) and test its potential to be a novel therapeutic target which could limit metabolic inflammation in T2DM. In this application, we posit a key role for DPP4 in the pathogenesis of T2DM. Our overarching hypothesis is driven by three key sets of preliminary data: a) DPP4 on immune cells was up-regulated in both circulation and visceral adipose tissue of diabetic humans, correlating strongly with markers of insulin resistance, b) Activation of Toll-like receptor/MyD88 pathway increased DPP4 expression and deficiency of MyD88 improved incretin-mediated blood glucose lowering effect through down-regulation of DPP4. c) DPP4 exacerbated adipose inflammation and insulin resistance through catalytic independent interaction with adenosine deaminase (ADA). We propose to test the significance of T cell-expressing DPP4 as part of an ongoing inter-disciplinary investigation that will significantly enhance my training and propel my career towards ultimate goal (to be an independent scientist working in translational diabetes research involving multiple disciplines): In Aim 1, we will explore the mechanisms by which DPP4 is up-regulated in T2DM and test the contribution of T cell derived DPP4 to pathogenesis of T2DM. Our hypothesis is that postprandial remnant lipoprotein in T2DM increases DPP4 expression via TLR/MyD88 pathway. In Aim 2, we hypothesize that T cell DPP4 promotes inflammation & insulin resistance through its non-catalytic function, forming a feed-forward loop to exacerbate T2DM. DPP4 non-catalytic function enhances T cell inflammation by interacting with ADA. By using DPP4-/- mice and DPP4mut mice with point mutation in DPP4 catalytic site, we will dissociate DPP4 catalytic and non-catalytic function and dissect the contribution of DPP4 non-catalytic function to diabetes. Involving mechanisms will be examined by detection of DPP4/ADA interaction. Collectively, the experimental findings from this application should help drive new understanding of pathophysiology of T2DM. Successful execution of this application may lead to a new therapeutic strategy for T2DM. It's well-known that inhibition of DPP4 catalytic function modulates postprandial hyperglycemia symptoms. In this application, we will test the hypothesis that DPP4 non-catalytic function promotes inflammation, an important cause of diabetes. Targeting DPP4 may improve both hyperglycemia and inflammation in T2DM."

"9333904","Project Summary Heart failure (HF) has emerged as the greatest current challenge in cardiovascular medicine. Detection of subclinical cardiac dysfunction could give us a unique opportunity to treat patients at an earlier stage of disease and to modify the risk factors to prevent or slow HF development and progression. In HF with dilated non-ischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM), early changes in extracellular matrix volume (ECV) and formation of myocardial fibrosis and inflammation result in impairment of ventricle function and precipitation of arrhythmias. Therefore, early detection of these changes could have significant clinical impact. Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) is a non-invasive, multifaceted, powerful imaging modality that employs no ionization radiation, has high spatial resolution and provides excellent soft tissue contrast. Myocardial T1 and T2 relaxation times change in the presence of interstitial diffuse fibrosis and inflammation. A major limitation of current CMR technique is use of semi-quantitative and subjective assessment of disease status. Novel advances in CMR allow voxel-wise quantification of relaxation times to characterize myocardial tissue composition, analogous to myocardial regional biopsy, as a unique and powerful tool which is unparalleled by any other imaging modality. We have recently developed novel approaches to accurately measure in-vivo myocardial T1 and T2 times. In this study, we propose to continue development, refinement and multi-center/multi-vendor evaluation of our multi-slice T1 and T2 mapping sequences. Concurrently, in a pilot clinical study, we will assess the predictive value of T1, T2 and ECV in patients with newly recognized dilated NICM for HF progression and adverse cardiac events over a 2-year clinical follow up. We will also assess incremental value of CMR vs. non-CMR markers of HF progression and adverse cardiac events."
"9312919","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  The applicant's goals are to develop the necessary skills to become an independent translational researcher in the area of neonatal/pediatric asthma. Childhood asthma developing early in life is a major healthcare burden. Corticosteroids (CS) are used therapeutically, but compared to adults, children require higher CS doses, and some develop CS resistance with greater airway remodeling that is difficult to treat. The mechanisms underlying CS insensitivity in developing airway are largely unknown. Airway smooth muscle (ASM) is a key cell type in asthma, and exhibits hyperreactivity (AHR), proliferation, and remodeling in response to inflammation. There is currently little information on how developing ASM contributes to neonatal/pediatric asthma, or to CS resistance. The overall hypothesis is that Th1 inflammation (TNF?, IFN?) induces CS insensitivity in developing airway by disrupting glucocorticoid receptor expression and signaling, leading to enhanced ASM proliferation and remodeling. In terms of potential therapy, there is increasing evidence for Vitamin D (VitD) enhancing CS sensitivity, but little to no information on underlying mechanisms, particularly in developing airway (a second focus of this proposal). Via 3 Aims, the applicant will progressively build towards research independence investigating CS insensitivity in neonatal/pediatric asthma: Aim 1 (K99 Phase): Using an in vitro model of Th1 induced CS insensitivity, determine mechanisms by which inflammation inhibits GR signaling and activity in developing human ASM. Aim 2 (K99/R00 Phases): Using an in vitro model of Th1 induced CS insensitivity determine mechanisms by which VitD enhances GR signaling in developing human ASM. Specific Aim 3 (R00 Phase): In novel CS-insensitive vs. ?sensitive newborn mouse models of allergic airway inflammation, determine interactions between CS and calcitriol in alleviating AHR and remodeling. The mentored phase will examine how Th1 cytokines disrupt CS signaling in human fetal ASM (18-22 week gestation). The applicant will receive training in investigating cellular, molecular, and epigenetic mechanisms related to glucocorticoid receptor signaling via an in vitro model of neonatal CS insensitivity involving Th1 cytokines. Complementary didactic, intellectual, and professional training will help prepare the applicant for the R00 phase where he will examine mechanisms relating to how VitD may enhance CS sensitivity in developing ASM using in vitro and novel in vivo neonatal mouse models of CS insensitivity. Together, these novel studies will enhance current understanding of how inflammation early in life disrupts glucocorticoid receptor signaling, and will identify the potential for VitD to improve CS sensitivity. The applicant will be mentored by senior, established investigators with substantial expertise in ASM physiology, lung immunology, glucocorticoid signaling, and asthma. Importantly, this project will provide a foundation for the applicant to establish an independent research program in neonatal/pediatric airway disease."
"9206088","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Cancers of the renal cortex are known as renal cell carcinomas (RCC) and represent ~80-85% of all primary renal neoplasms. The clear cell variant comprises up to 85% of all RCCs, which are expected to result in ~64,000 new cases and ~14,000 deaths in the U.S. in 2014. Clear cell RCC is a disease that increases with age and is more common in men, and as such represents a common source of cancer-related morbidity and mortality amongst our Veterans. The disease is lethal at the advanced, metastatic stage. Although several novel treatments, including small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors and rapamycin analogs, have received regulatory approval, their overall impact on survival is modest, and median survival for patients with metastatic clear cell RCC remains at only ~24 months.  The molecular hallmark of hereditary and sporadic clear cell RCC is the biallelic inactivation of the vonHippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene, which is most well characterized for its role as the substrate recognition unit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that targets hypoxia-inducible factor alpha (HIF?) for proteasomemediated degradation. Importantly, upwards of 90% of sporadic cases of clear cell RCC manifest VHL inactivation. Although restoration of the expression pVHL, the protein product of the VHL gene, suppresses tumorigenesis as does inhibition of HIF? expression, gene replacement therapy and the development of small molecule inhibitors of transcription factors such as HIF? s not readily feasible for clinical translation. The overarching goal of our proposed research is to validate HIF?-independent effects of VHL loss as viable therapeutic targets for clear cell RCC. Specifically, we propose to generate the pre-clinical data to establish that a MAP kinase kinase kinase known as transforming growth factor ? activated kinase (TAK1), which is hyperactivated in response to pVHL deficiency, is a suitable target for drug development and translation into the clinic. We have already established that TAK1 drives the activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-?B) pathways, both of which are pro-tumorigenic and constitutively activated in pVHL-deficient RCCs. Thus, our hypothesis is that TAK1 inhibition represents a potential therapeutic target that mediates renal oncogenesis through downstream activation of the NF-?B and JNK pathways. Based on this background and our preliminary studies, many of which have been published, we have proposed three aims:  Aim 1. To establish that TAK1 inhibition prevents and retards the growth of pVHL-deficient RCCs in vitro and in vivo.  Aim 2. To elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that are permissive for concurrent, constitutive activation of the NF-?B and JNK pathways in pVHL-deficient cells.  Based on preliminary studies, we postulate that molecular adaptations acquired by pVHL-deficient RCCs are critical to the ongoing, constitutive JNK activation that characterizes pVHL-deficient cells.  Aim 3. To establish that constitutive TAK1 and concurrent NF-?B and JNK activation occur in clear cell RCC patient specimens. As a critical component to the process of pre-clinical validation of a molecular target, it is vital to confirm that the relevant pathways ar indeed activated in patient specimens in a fashion that is consistent with our pre-clinical models.  Successful execution of the proposed aims will lay the groundwork for the validation of TAK1, a druggable kinase that is hyperactivated as a consequence of VHL loss, as a molecular target for clinical development. In this fashion, our long-term goal is to translate our findings to the management of advanced clear cell RCC, a relatively common malignancy amongst our Veterans."
"8813624","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this study is to examine Major Depression (MDD) in disaster survivors who have been most directly affected. MDD is usually the second most common disorder in disaster survivors with reported prevalence as high as 45%. However, it has been markedly under-studied by comparison to the literature on posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We will be investigating (1) pre-disaster and disaster experience predictors of post-disaster MDD, (2) post-disaster symptoms that may serve as indicators of full MDD, and (3) coping behaviors in depressed survivors that prospectively predict current MDD at follow up years later. We propose a secondary analysis of datasets collected from 10 different disasters. These datasets were collected by the same team within a narrow timeframe after the disasters and include follow-up data for up to 3 years, allowing for a richer cross-disaster comparison than any prior study of post-disaster MDD. This is especially important because psychopathology varies tremendously in prevalence among disasters. This research has the potential to (1) help non-clinician disaster responders target high-risk individuals for MDD among disaster-exposed populations, (2) yield guidelines for screening procedures and inform future efforts to design a sensitive and specific screening instrument for post-disaster MDD, (3) help clinicians to identify coping behaviors and other factors that predict the level of functioning and the presence of MDD as reassessed years later. More broadly, this research has the potential to inform debates about whether and how post-disaster MDD differs from PTSD and from MDD in the general population by identifying similarities and differences between their risk factors."
"9258327","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Word learning is a complex phenomenon because it is tied to many different behaviors. It also involves many different perceptual and conceptual systems and is extended in time. Although complex, achieving a richer understanding of early word learning is a fundamental goal given that vocabulary development is correlated with later cognitive functioning and with processes that have a pervasive impact on general cognitive abilities such as executive function. Moreover, deficits in early word learning have a profound effect on cognitive functioning in atypical populations including children with specific language impairment. Given the complexity of word learning, a central challenge has been to establish empirical paradigms that effectively reveal the processes of word learning and to develop new theories that uncover the mechanisms that move word learning forward. Our previous work suggests word learning occurs in a cascade of individual decisions about word meaning in the moment. These decisions build on each other to shape subsequent decisions and, over multiple timescales, create developmental change. The goal of this grant is to develop and test a unified model of word learning that captures processes at both the second-to-second and developmental timescales and provides a process-based account of how individual behaviors accumulate to create development. The research plan builds and tests this model. Specific Aim 1 creates a unified model of word learning behaviors that extends beyond our prior work on noun generalization to include processes of comprehension, production, referent selection, and generalization from multiple exemplars. Specific Aim 2 adds a more complete account of object-word interactions and the development of word learning biases. Specific Aim 3 adds a memory process, enabling the model to learn a lexicon over multiple timescales and develop word learning biases. The end result of this work will be models of individual developmental trajectories that integrate word learning processes over multiple timescales-a necessary step towards intervention in cases of atypical development such as SLI, or prematurity. The integration of processes over multiple timescales and at the level of individual participants is an issue few models have addressed directly. Furthermore, the model we propose brings together work on object processing in visual cognition with work on early word learning an is related to a larger program of neurally-grounded modeling work that integrates across multiple visual, spatial, motor and language systems. Thus this model will be foundational to a full understanding of the multiple systems involved in word learning and vocabulary development, and to the interaction of these processes with cognition more generally."
"9480132","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Norepinephrine (NE) provides excitatory drive onto midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons and modulates responses to dopaminergic drugs, including psychostimulants. Chronic loss of noradrenergic tone impairs DA neuron firing and DA release, leading to compensatory alterations in postsynaptic DA receptor signaling and a paradoxical hypersensitivity to dopaminergic drugs. The goal of this proposal is to identify the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the behavioral hypersensitivity to cocaine following chronic inhibition of the NE biosynthetic enzyme, dopamine ?ydroxylase (DBH). Based on our preliminary data, we propose that a chronic loss of NE produces a decrease in ?rrestin2 (?r2) in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), which promotes a reversal in the valence of D2 responses from inhibitory to excitatory, potentially via a G?to-G?switch in D2 receptor coupling. In Aim 1, we will determine the consequences of increasing or reducing the amount of ?r2 selectively in D1 or D2 NAc neurons on behavioral responses to D2 agonist and cocaine. We will also test whether decreasing NAc neuron excitability normalizes cocaine responses following chronic DBH inhibition. In Aim 2, we will use slice electrophysiology to determine whether decreasing ?r2 specifically in D1 or D2 NAc neurons is necessary and sufficient to trigger the switch from D2-mediated inhibition to excitation and further investigate alterations in D2 G protein coupling. In Aim 3, we will assess the effects of chronic DBH inhibition and reduction of ?r2 on the aversive properties of cocaine using the runway model of cocaine self-administration in rats. Completion of these Specific Aims will contribute to our understanding of noradrenergic modulation of mesolimbic DA transmission, the plasticity of DA receptor signaling pathways, and NE-DA interactions underlying aversive responses to drugs of abuse."

"9206079","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Hypertension is a major cause of chronic kidney disease in the Veterans that leads to end stage renal disease. The current therapeutic options in the clinical settings for this devastating condition are limited and often ineffective except dialysis or kidney transplantation. Therefore, a  better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of hypertensive kidney disease is essential for developing effective strategies for the treatment of this progressive kidney disorder.  We have studied the factors initiating and controlling the development of hypertensive kidney disease in a model of angiotensin II-induced hypertension and have discovered a critical and obligate role for immune-inflammatory dysregulation in the initiation of hypertensive kidney disease. We have found that the development of hypertensive kidney disease arises from the infiltration of mononuclear cells (monocytes/macrophage, T cells, and bone marrow-derived fibroblasts) into the kidney. The presence and activation of these cells from a CD45+ mononuclear population appear to be driven by and dependent upon induction of the chemokine, CXCL16, in renal tubular epithelial cells and is prevented by genetic disruption of CXCL16. Our preliminary studies have shown that induction of CXCL16 is associated with striking activation of PI3 kinase signaling in vivo, which is regulated by p PTEN) and the adaptor protein containing a PH domain, PTB domain, and leucine zipper motif 1 (APPL1) in vitro. Therefore, we hosphatase and tensin homologue deleted on chromosome ten (hypothesize that pathologic renal injury and fibrosis arises from immune-inflammatory dysregulation associated with induction of CXCL16 and subsequent activation of PI3 kinase /Akt. We propose that CXCL16 triggers PI3 kinase /Akt activation, initiating the uptake of circulating mononuclear cell population obligate to the resultant kidney injury and fibrosis, which is regulated by PTEN and APPL1. To test our hypothesis, we will pursue the following Specific Aims: Specific Aim 1 is to determine the role of PI3K in the recruitment of bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 2 is to examine whether PTEN regulates PI3K/Akt signaling and inflammatory cell migration in vitro and in vivo. Specific Aim 3 is to evaluate whether APPL1 function as a negative regulator of PI3K/Akt signaling and inflammatory cell migration in vitro and in vivo.  In summary, we plan to utilize biological, pharmacological, and genetic approaches to study the signaling mechanisms underlying immune-inflammatory dysregulation in the pathogenesis of Ang II- induced renal injury and fibrosis. Results from our studies will provide a new understanding of the molecular and cellular bases of hypertensive kidney disease and could lead to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of hypertensive kidney disease."
"9311722","Abstract  Children with fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) often present sensory alterations such as aversion to multiple sensory stimuli presented at the same time, attention deficits, poor visual-motor integration, and disrupted general sensory processing. There is growing evidence supporting the idea that these problems give rise to social problems and learning deficits. Therefore, understanding the effects of developmental alcohol exposure in the processing of different sensory modalities is crucial to devise interventions to ameliorate neurobehavioral problems seen in FASD. Multisensory integration (MSI) is a higher order function in which the combination of inputs from two or more sensory modalities leads to either facilitation or suppression of neuronal responses. MSI relies on the precise wiring of the individual sensory systems and then on the accuracy of convergence of these systems to multisensory processing areas. This precision is acquired by activity-dependent neuronal plasticity processes that include sprouting and pruning of connections. In the human cortex, most of these plastic changes occur during the third trimester of human gestation. Ethanol is known to severely affect activity-dependent neuronal plasticity in the cortex. Our overarching hypothesis is that alcohol exposure during development disrupts the functional and structural connectivity of multisensory cortical areas altering MSI and contributing to neurobehavioral impairments in FASD. In the studies proposed here we will use a combination of advanced imaging techniques; in vivo electrophysiology and a novel ex vivo slice preparation to evaluate the effect of developmental alcohol exposure on the structural, functional and electrophysiological properties of multisensory cortical areas. Moreover we will test whether boosting activity-dependent neuronal plasticity would reverse the effects of alcohol on multisensory processing. The accomplishment of these experiments will make a major and paradigm-shifting contribution towards the FASD research field."
"9239036","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The intestinal lymphatic system serves physiological functions, including uptake of lipids, vitamins, immune surveillance, and fluid homeostasis. It is made up of distinct lymphatic endothelial cell populations that require regulatory pathways to maintain lymphatic vessel fate, microenvironment and functionality. We have demonstrated that Notch functions in cell fate determination of lymphatic endothelial cells and to maintain intestinal lymphatic homeostasis. Notch signaling is active throughout the intestinal lymphatic system, including the ductal, valve, and lacteal lymphatic endothelium. Disrupting Notch signaling or Mmp14 leads to shared lymphangiogenic and mesenteric lymphatic valve defects. Notch and MMP14 are linked to diverse intestinal and cardiovascular disorders and our novel studies will shed light on their role in intestinal diseases that have lymphatic defects as an underlying factor. We hypothesize that Notch regulates the extracellular matrix of the intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic vasculature via induction of MMPs and regulation of matrix proteins in a context-dependent manner. To address this hypothesis, we will determine lymphatic endothelial Notch function in postnatal intestinal and mesenteric lymphatics. We will use transgenic mice to transcriptional profile Notch responses in intestinal and mesenteric lymphatic endothelial cells and in a tether-ligand assay. The mechanism by which Notch regulates Mmp14 expression and its effects on lymphatic endothelial cell behavior will be determined. Conditional mice will be used to alter lymphatic endothelial Notch signaling with and without lymphatic endothelial Mmp14 deletion to define Notch functions in maturation and homeostasis of mesenteric lymphatic collecting ducts. As Notch is active in lacteal endothelial cells and Notch mutants display lacteal defects, we will use conditional mouse models to study the role of Notch in the lacteals during development and homeostasis. We will determine if abnormal matrix accumulation in the villi in Antxr1-/-;Antxr2-/- mice leads to lymphatic dysfunction and changes lymphatic endothelial Notch signaling. Our proposed research aims to uncover mechanisms by which Notch modulates extracellular matrix proteins and regulatory pathways in lymphatic endothelial cells to understand digest tract lymphatic development, homeostasis and function."

"9267555","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The prevalence of HIV/AIDS in Cambodia increased sharply in the 1990s, reaching upwards of 40% among high-risk populations.2 While the prevalence rate declined to approximately 0.9% by 2006, it remains inflated among high-risk groups.3 In the wake of the epidemic, the Cambodian government initiated national data collection and disease monitoring efforts that have produced rich, longitudinal data from HIV/AIDS treatment and surveillance programs. However, a shortage of professionals trained to manage and interpret these types of data, persists. The UCLA Department of Epidemiology and the Cambodian University of Health Sciences (UHS) propose a program to train a cohort of Cambodian public health professionals in the management, analysis and evaluation of secondary data. Trainees will have two tracks from which to choose. The UCLA MS/MPH track requires coursework in epidemiologic methods and principles, biostatistics, data management, behavioral sciences and HIV/AIDS epidemiology. This track also requires completion of a master's project that must be relevant for HIV/AIDS policy development in Cambodia. The UCLA PhD track requires trainees complete core courses in epidemiology as well as courses in logic, causation and probability, the biology of HIV/AIDS, graduate statistics and pass a qualifying exam. Trainees then carry out a dissertation in Cambodia that is relevant to HIV/AIDS policy. The overall program will be assessed based on trainee progress and matriculation rates; thesis/dissertation quality, policy relevance and the proportion published; the program's impact on UHS recruitment rates and trainee placement in national HIV/AIDS monitoring and data analysis roles."
"9213704","Project Abstract: Care for older adults with Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD) during the final years of life is extremely costly and families carry a high share of this burden. Costs and shifting patterns of year-over-year spending are likely associated with adverse care quality and family financial outcomes, yet to date individual- level, comprehensive, longitudinal data on spending and its effect on outcomes have not been examined. Existing data also demonstrate that those vulnerable subgroups least able to cope are at greatest financial risk, which may result in further disparities in outcomes. Therefore, this project aims to understand the magnitude of this healthcare spending and its distribution across payers and families over time and how this spending contributes to disparities in care quality and family outcomes among older adults with dementia, particularly among vulnerable and underserved populations. The study will assemble data that capture total healthcare spending and proportion by payer (i.e., Medicare, Medicaid, individuals, families, and others), using the nationally-representative Health and Retirement Study and linked Medicare and Medicaid claims data. Specifically, the project will 1) Compare yearly patterns of total health-related costs and proportion of costs paid by Medicare, Medicaid, out-of-pocket, informal caregiving, and other payers, in each of the last 5 years of life among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; 2) Test if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with indicators of care quality (nursing home admission for long- term care, ?3 transitions across care sites in the last 90 days of life, suboptimal hospice use, i.e. enrollment >6 months or <3 days, and in-hospital death) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups; and 3) Examine if out-of-pocket costs exceeding household wealth are associated with potentially adverse intergenerational family financial outcomes (cohabitation, caregiving and financial support by adult children) among older adults with or without ADRD and across vulnerable subgroups. The results will directly inform health and social policy, and help to ensure high quality care for older adults with ADRD, while avoiding impoverishment of families and compounding of racial and socioeconomic disparities."

"9263772","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     The goal of the MundoComm initiative is to develop an innovative training program that enhances the ability of community-based teams in Latin America to use ICT for maternal health improvement. Evidence demonstrates the feasibility and potential of ICT to impact maternal health, which continues to be an intransigent problem for much of the world, including Latin America. Costa Rica is a regional hub for technology and health in Latin America and serves as the base for this initiative. This project directly emerges from a previously NIH Fogarty- funded ITMI project (InfoComm) that focused on building a generation of informatics-trained public health physicians in Costa Rica and two subsequent NIH-funded trials (one through Fogarty) in the Dominican Republic. This project links the two former Fogarty PIs at the University of Rochester Medical Center with their Fogarty trainees and other faculty from three medical schools (Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and US), one technology school (Costa Rica), and community organizations to foster cross-collaboration, technological innovation and expanded use of ICT to improve maternal health in the region. Specific aims include: 1) Developing a mentored training program for applied research teams from throughout Latin America to learn about ICT applications in maternal health; 2) Testing specific team ICT innovations in field settings to demonstrate feasibility and appropriateness for local context; 3) Creating a Collaboratory where stakeholders share developing material, comment on plans, and provide support for trainees in the innovation process; and 4) Stimulating development of a professional network of ICT, medical, public health professionals with students, faculty, researchers, and practitioners devoted to supporting ICT for Maternal Health in Latin America. MundoComm will train multidisciplinary teams of public health and community professionals in a mentored environment with core and technical faculty, through a combination of didactic, experiential, and distance-based methods. The mode of instruction is engaging, experiential, and team-oriented, leveraging communications modalities (e.g. social networking, crowd-sourcing) to create visibility and feedback mechanisms for community-led ICT prototypes feasibility testing. A summative-formative evaluation process coincides with the project to help describe and evaluate the training model and the ICT innovations that result from the trainees' efforts. By training multidisciplinary teams and promoting tools of collaboration, partnership, and engagement, the project hopes to sustain effort toward using ICT for public health improvement."
"9275297","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     Risk factors for anxiety disorder are important in determining who ultimately develops the disorder. However, our understanding of risk factors is rudimentary. Identification of the mechanisms of risk factors would be a step forward in understanding the etiology of anxiety disorders. Reduced hippocampal volume, dysfunction of the brain-derived neurotrophin factor (BDNF) system and behavioral inhibition temperament are three anxiety risk factors identified in humans. The risk factor of reduced hippocampal volume is associated with impaired hippocampal-dependent learning, suggesting impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity in individuals at risk. BDNF is important for synaptic plasticity. Thus, we hypothesize that impaired hippocampal synaptic plasticity may underlie the risk factors of both reduced hippocampal volume and BDNF dysfunction. The Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rat is an inbred strain that is stress sensitive, has a reduced hippocampal volume compared to the outbred Sprague Dawley (SD) rat, has an abnormal BDNF system and expresses a behavioral inhibition. In addition, WKY rats acquire active avoidance to a greater and more persistent degree than SD rats. Abnormal avoidance is a core feature of all anxiety disorders, and the development of abnormal avoidance parallels the trajectory of PTSD (cluster C). Thus, the proposed studies will test whether impaired synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus contributes to the development of abnormal avoidance learning in the presence and absence of behavioral inhibition temperament. Four aims are proposed. Aim 1 will determine whether BDNF-induced synaptic plasticity is impaired in the hippocampus of WKY rats and if NMDA and BDNF agonists can attenuate these impairments. Aim 2 will investigate the effects of drugs acting on NMDA and BDNF-TrkB receptors on avoidance learning. Aim 3 will determine if opioid-dependent LTP in the hippocampus is impaired in WKY rats. Opioid-dependent LTP does not require NMDA or TrkB receptors. Aim 4 will investigate whether drugs acting on opioid receptors can affect the development of abnormal avoidance responding. Because opioid-dependent LTP is independent of NMDA and TrkB receptors, the comparison of opioid LTP to NMDA- and BDNF-LTP will determine whether the development of abnormal avoidance requires impairment of a specific type of LTP (i.e., NMDA) or if impairment to any of the various forms of LTP in the hippocampus can lead to the development of abnormal avoidance. The proposed studies will start to elucidate the mechanisms and interactions of three risk factors for anxiety disorders. Understanding the etiology of anxiety disorders and mechanisms of risk factors will help in the development of treatments. This is especially important to the health of veterans because a significant number of veterans are likely to develop anxiety-related disorders as a result of the extreme stress associated with combat service."
"9275391","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         The hallmark cardiac manifestation associated with autoantibodies reactive with the intracellular soluble ribonucleoprotein SSA/Ro, is complete atrioventricular block that affects fetuses and/or newborn of mothers with anti-Ro antibodies. Anti-Ro antibodies are not considered pathogenic for the adult heart conduction system but emerging new clinical evidence demonstrates that the prevalence of corrected QT (QTc) and the frequency of complex ventricular arrhythmias is alarmingly higher in patients with various autoimmune diseases. Patients with moderate to high levels (e50 U/ml) of anti-Ro antibodies exhibit longer QTc intervals and those with low antibody titers show normal QTc. The pathogenesis of this autoimmune associated long QT syndrome and the variability in QTc values in patients positive to anti-Ro antibodies is not well understood The preliminary data suggest that anti-Ro antibodies are arrhythmogenic as a result of interference with the ventricular repolarization. The K channel HERG which conducts the rapidly activating delayed K current, IKr, plays a major role in ventricular repolarization and is the main target for drugs-induced QTc prolongation. We hypothesize that anti-Ro antibodies from patients with QTc prolongation specifically target and inhibit HERG channel function, prolong action potential duration in a dose-dependent manner resulting in delayed repolarization seen as QT prolongation on the surface electrocardiogram. This hypothesis will be tested via four aims: Aim#1: To investigate the electrophysiological basis of variability of QTc prolongation in anti-Ro antibody positive adult patients with connective tissue disease (CTD). Aim #2: To investigate the electrophysiological basis for the absence of QTc prolongation in a subset of CTD adult patients with anti-Ro antibodies. Aim#3: To elucidate the possible antigenic target of pathological antibodies on the HERG channel. Aim#4: To establish animal models of autoimmune-associated QTc prolongation. Significance to Veterans Health: Patients with connective tissue diseases have a high prevalence of QTc prolongation and high incidence of life threatening arrhythmias. QTc prolongation associated with anti-Ro antibodies per se confers an increased risk of developing cardiac arrhythmias and represents an additional risk factor for patients with pre-existing acquired or congenital long QTc. A major impact from this study is the potential recommendation that patients with moderate to high anti-Ro antibodies should benefit from routine ECG testing and those identified with anti-Ro antibodies associated QTc prolongation should receive counseling, including education about drugs that may put them at risk for life threatening arrhythmias. This is relevant to Veterans health because of the highly prevalent use of antipsychotic and antidepressant drugs that are known to prolong the QTc interval in both men and women Veterans."
"9320708","Project 2: Muscular dystrophy clinical trial foundations. Substantial evidence implicates aberrant reactivation of DUX4 expression as the cause of facioscapulohumeral dystrophy (FSHD). Expression profiling of primary myoblasts transduced with DUX4 has identified DUX4 regulated genes, many of which are involved in germline and early stem cell development. Many of these genes are expressed in FSHD muscle but not in muscle from healthy controls, making them ideal biomarker candidates. As FSHD research enters a translational phase, the development of mechanistic, prognostic, and diagnostic biomarkers becomes critical in moving the translational process forward. Aim 1 is a cooperative clinical study for biomarker evaluation in FSHD that will (a) develop FSHD patient registration, assessments, and sample collection in Seattle that parallel those developed in Rochester; (b) develop FSHD MRI assessment capabilities in Rochester that parallel those developed in Seattle; and (c) perform a focused collaborative clinical study to determine the molecular determinants of the MRI findings characteristic of FSHD and to prioritize the best candidate biomarkers for disease activity. Aim 2 will determine whether CD8+ T cells infiltrating FSHD muscle recognize DUX4 induced cancer/testes (C/T) antigens, and will (a) characterize the phenotype, location, and cytokine profile of the T cell/immune cell infiltrate in skeletal muscle in FSHD; (b) expand T cells from FSHD muscle, determine the T cell receptor Vb gene usage and characterize their function; and (c) determine whether T cells derived from FSHD muscle recognize FSHD muscle antigens. These combined aims represent a synergistic effort to evaluate the  relationship between tissue biomarkers, histopathology, MRI imaging characteristics, and muscle function, together with a direct characterization of the T cell infiltrate the immune response in the pathophysiology of FSHD."

The training faculty chosen from the Consortium consists of highly interactive investigators whose scientific interests include aging and Alzheimer's disease, and spans fly, rodent, and nonhuman primate models of aging, as well as human studies in normal aging and in Alzheimer's disease. Six institutions within the Consortium contribute primary mentors to this Training Program, including: Arizona State University, the Barrow Neurological Institute, the Banner Sun Health Research Institute, the Translational Genomics Research Institute, the University of Arizona, and the Banner Alzheimer's Institute. Faculty have complementary strengths in brain imaging, computer science, genomics, molecular biology, basic systems, behavioral and cognitive neuroscience, neuropathology, and clinical research to promote the scientific understanding of the aging brain and early detection of Alzheimer's disease, as well as effective treatment and prevention therapies. Each Fellow will have a Professional Development Committee (PDC) that consists of 4 Mentors. A primary research Mentor in whose laboratory the Fellow will be based, who is chosen from the list of Training Faculty included within the tables of this grant, and a secondary research Mentor from this list, but from any other institution amongst the consortium. The secondary Mentor plays an active role in the research project undertaken by the Fellow, which goes beyond simply making facilities available. A tertiary Mentor may be drawn from the Training Faculty list, but can also be selected on the basis of experimental or pedagogical expertise, even if not among the Training Faculty. Additionally, a fourth member of the PDC will be chosen from amongst the 5 person leadership team of Director, co-Directors or Associate Directors, who will commit to provide an additional level of oversight. The Director chosen will be selected on the basis of suitability for assisting with the Fellow's research project. We believ that exposure to the unique Arizona tradition of cooperation and collaboration that knows no institutional boundaries will facilitate a significant enrichment of skills sets, professional development, and publication record of the Fellow during the training period. In addition to multi-laboratory research exposure, another unique programmatic aspect takes the form of three half or full day workshops per year. These include statewide events that Training Faculty attend (Annual Arizona Alzheimer's Consortium Retreat and Arizona Alzheimer's Consortium Annual Scientific Conference), as well as professional events that include broader national and international participation (Society for Neuroscience meeting). We believe the goal to give the Fellow the freedom to draw broadly from facilities and expertise within the Consortium will allow the best experiments to be designed to test important questions, and will instill an appreciation for collaboration and interdisciplinary interaction that will provide the trainee a solid foundatio for productive future work."
"9275388","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         PROJECT SUMMARY One of the major consequences of chronic alcohol use in brain is increased inflammation that leads to neurodegeneration with associated cognitive and psychiatric impairments. Neuropsychiatric impairments persist in patients following substance abuse and are associated with poorer treatment outcomes. HCV is also associated with a variety of extrahepatic syndromes, including central nervous system (CNS) damage and neuropsychiatric impairments. However, it is unclear whether such cognitive and mood disturbances are a function of systemic disease, damaged hepatic function, or virus infection of the CNS. Animal models are needed to provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms and pathways affected by co-morbid alcohol dependence and chronic viral infection, and also those which are responsible for the persistence of neuropsychiatric impairments following abstinence and viral clearance. Our overall hypothesis is that HCV patients with co-morbid AUDs are at increased risk of brain damage that contributes to alcohol relapse risk. In humans and across species, our goal is to identify specific mechanisms by which chronic viral infection and alcohol induce abnormalities in immune cell function and contribute to persistent neuropsychiatric impairments. The following specific aims are proposed: 1) Determine the effects of HCV and alcohol use on peripheral T cell response and psychiatric function in veterans with co-morbid HCV and AUDs. Biological specimens and psychiatric data will be derived from those currently being collected for a treatment trial in veterans with HCV and co-morbid AUDs. We will obtain peripheral blood mononuclear cells and evaluate them across time for: i) phenotypic changes in T-cell populations, ii) surface and intracellular accumulation of cytokines, and iii) immunoreactivity to neuroantigens and other antigens. Blood samples will be used to measure key cytokines and chemokines, viral load, and liver enzymes. Rating scales that measure depression, anxiety, and alcohol consumption will also be used. Results from the immunoassays will be analyzed in relation to psychiatric measures, viral load, and alcohol use, as well as in relation to the findings from Aim 2. 2) Investigate the role of chronic alcohol exposure in regulating peripheral and central T-cell responses, CNS immunopathology, and behavioral signs of anxiety, depression, and cognitive impairments in mice infected with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV, clone 13 variant), an established model for HCV infections in humans. Mice will be chronically exposed to and dependent on ethanol administered intragastrically followed by intravenous injection of LCMV (or vehicle) to evaluate the consequences of co-morbidity. Behavioral tests will be conducted following ethanol exposure to assess anxiety, depressive-like behavior, and cognitive function. Blood, brain, and spleen samples will be collected to: i) measure blood ethanol concentrations, liver enzymes, viral titers, and key cytokines and chemokines, ii) evaluate T cell frequencies, including LCMV-specific CD8+ T cells (utilizing tetramer analysis; H-2Ld-restricted NP118), iii) calculate the percentage of CD4+, CD8+, and antigen-specific CD8+ T cells producing key cytokines (e.g., TNF- ), iv) evaluate immunoreactivity to neuroantigens, and v) assess neuroinflammation and neuronal degeneration. Examining the role of alcohol in regulating viral persistence and CNS immunopathology in LCMV-infected mice will lead to a more comprehensive understanding of co-morbid AUDs and HCV and may identify targets for future therapeutic development. If our hypotheses are supported, future studies will test our immunotherapeutic strategy that we have found reduces neuroinflammation and improves cognitive function in mouse models of methamphetamine dependence. Interventions that successfully treat alcohol induced neuropsychiatric impairments have a high likelihood of also reducing relapse rates and improving treatment outcomes."
"9300914","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Every year, over 6000 healthy individuals donate a kidney in the United States to benefit a loved one or even a stranger. Currently, approximately 100,000 individuals are living post-nephrectomy. Live kidney donors gain no medical benefit from donation, nor do they expect to. However, live donors do expect the medical community to understand the long-term risks of kidney donation, for the purposes of donor selection, informed consent, and post-donation care. For African American kidney donors, we have thus far failed in this regard.  The largest cohort study of kidney donors, from which the transplant community's assessment of the safety of kidney donation has been primarily derived, was comprised of less than 1% African American donors. Yet 13% of live donors in the US are African American, and our preliminary findings suggest that rates of death, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, and end-stage renal disease following donation are significantly higher in African Americans. It is critical to not only estimate the risk of these diseases, but to understand the risk attributable t donation; however, no study to date has captured appropriate non-donor controls that are necessary for this estimation. Furthermore, many African American donors, particularly young donors, have limited access to healthcare, and it is important to elucidate potential disparities i the management of post- donation consequences such as hypertension and decline in kidney function.  In light of a significant knowledge gap regarding long-term outcomes and medical care following kidney donation in African Americans, we propose to estimate the incidence and consequences of hypertension and kidney disease in African American versus Caucasian donors. More importantly, we will determine how much of that risk is attributable to donating a kidney (rather than population-based differences in underlying risk) by comparing donors to healthy non-donors. We will also evaluate the reliability of administrative data sources in capturing and studying post-donation morbidity, and seek to better understand racial differences in treatment patterns for donors who develop hypertension or chronic kidney disease. We will accomplish these goals by recruiting the largest primary cohort of African American donors (over 4000 donors from the top 13 centers in the US), a comparison cohort of Caucasian donors, and healthy non-donors who met eligibility criteria for donation but did not actually donate. We will supplement these cohort with linkage of national registry data to Medicare, Medicaid, and private payer claims and pharmacy data.  Our findings will have a direct impact on the practice of live kidney donation among African Americans in the US, informing critical aspects of donor selection, informed consent for donation, and post-donation care. In addition, this research will create an important resource from which several future ancillary projects are foreseeable, including genotyping to risk stratify potential donors, evaluating the effects of acut kidney injury and nephrotoxic drugs after donation, and estimating lifetime healthcare costs and utilization for kidney donors."
"9275431","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         ABSTRACT: Cholangiocytes are the target cells in cholestatic liver diseases such as primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC). During the course of these diseases, mitotically dormant cholangiocytes are stimulated to proliferate and then are damaged. Associated with these cholangiopathies is a dysregulation of various neuroendocrine factors derived from the hypothalamus and the acquisition of a neuroendocrine phenotype in cholangiocytes. Taken together, these events contribute to the autocrine and paracrine pathways that modulate the proliferative response of cholangiocytes as well as liver damage and fibrosis in cholestatic liver injury. We have previously shown that circulating neuropeptide Y, and corticoptropin releasing hormone (CRH) are altered in models of biliary proliferation. Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is dampened resulting in suppressed glucocorticoid levels during extrahepatic biliary obstruction and that reactivation of the HPA axis by hypothalamic administration of CRH suppresses the proliferative capacity of cholangiocytes after bile duct ligation (BDL), suggesting a broader concept of hypothalamic control of cholangiocyte proliferation. The objective of this proposal is to investigate mechanisms by which cholestasis regulates the expression of the hypothalamic peptide galanin and the subsequent effects of this altered response on cholangiocyte proliferation. Based upon strong preliminary data, we propose the novel central hypothesis that the bile acids that accumulate in the serum during cholestasis are responsible for the increased hypothalamic and circulating galanin levels and that the central and peripheral effects of galanin co-ordinately regulate cholangiocyte proliferation. Our proposed work will focus on three specific aims that have been designed to test the following working hypotheses: (1) The expression of the hypothalamic peptide galanin is upregulated during cholestatic liver diseases and activates the growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH) /growth hormone (GH) axis to induce cholangiocyte proliferation, (2) Circulating levels of galanin are increased during experimental cholestasis and can act on cholangiocytes directly to induce proliferation, and (3) The alteration of the galanin expression in the hypothalamus is a direct result of the actions of bile acids in th hypothalamus. Dissecting the pathophysiological interactions between the brain and the liver during cholestatic liver diseases may lead to an enhanced understanding of the pathological processes and consequences of this particular type of live disease. This knowledge may play a paramount role in the development of therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cholangiopathies."
"9277874","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Twenty-first century biomedical science is a multidisciplinary, data-intensive global enterprise that depends critically on clear specification of research methods and results. The reproducibility of findings that is fundamental to good science and the meta-analysis of pooled data from disparate sources are both catalyzed by standardized approaches to acquiring and representing data. In this context, the PhenX (consensus measures for Phenotypes and eXposures) Toolkit is an increasingly valuable catalog of standard measures and associated bioinformatics tools that help investigators to improve the quality and consistency of their data collection and identify opportunities for collaborative research. Launched in 2009, PhenX Toolkit measures are being incorporated in several major studies and consortiums. The proposed 5- year research plan ?Genomic Resource Grant for PhenX Toolkit ? expansion and sustainability? expands the Toolkit?s scope and includes an updated interface and new ontology-based tools. The PhenX multidisciplinary team of researchers and developers, together with input from the scientific community, will increase the utility and impact of the PhenX Toolkit through the following Specific Aims. Specific Aim 1: Expand PhenX Toolkit research domains. Address the evolving needs of Toolkit users and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by adding PhenX measures related to cancer, environmental exposures, pediatrics, and mental health. Specific Aim 2: Maintain and extend existing collaborations. Accelerate efforts with external collaborators and facilitate navigation between the Toolkit and complementary resources such as the Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP), Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap), and the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Common Data Element (CDE) Resource and Logical Observation Identifiers Names and Codes (LOINC). Specific Aim 3: Raise awareness and increase impact. We propose a multifaceted educational component to raise awareness and increase use of PhenX measures and tools. Specific Aim 4: Link PhenX measures to established ontologies. The extended PhenX ontology (based on existing ontologies) will be implemented in a cloud computing environment in a way that will enable nimble navigation and the development of tools for users to link and harmonize variables across studies. Specific Aim 5: Provide new tools that investigators need. Develop a nimble and enriched interface that can traverse the increasing complexity of the Toolkit, support access by mobile devices, and leverage the PhenX ontology to develop novel tools for comparing measures and variables. Specific Aim 6: Project management and co- funded research. Enable effective communications and project management with a strong organization, assuring responsiveness, flexibility, and coordination of co-funding efforts. Through these aims, the PhenX Toolkit will support evolving research needs, help increase the impact of individual studies, facilitate translational research, and revolutionize data sharing and harmonization."
"9272770","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The subbaccalaureate educational attainment level --those who attended college but did not earn a bachelor's degree-- comprises 28% of American adults age 25 and older, or about 54 million people in the U.S. Surprisingly little is known about the health of adults in this major population group. A recent study by the PI and collaborators found a startling anomaly in the education gradient in health: adults at the subbaccalaureate level (especially college dropouts but also some recipients of associate's degrees) reported more health problems than high school graduates who never attended college. The gradient, which describes the monotonic positive association between schooling and health, has been understood to be universal across populations, health outcomes, and all levels of attainment. The fact that the gradient does not hold for 28% of the population may provide important clues about the mechanisms of the relationship between educational attainment and health. The long-term goal of the PI's research agenda is to understand how and why education and health are linked. The goal of this project is to compare the health of the subbaccalaureate group versus that of high school (HS) graduates who never attended college and college graduates, using three large, nationally-representative sources of data (the National Health Interview Survey 1997-2013, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2012, and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979). In Aim 1, we will provide a detailed picture of the health patterns across multiple health dimensions, across major population groups, and across age, period, and birth cohorts. In Aim 2, we will explore how specific mediating and confounding mechanisms-employment, economic circumstances, health behaviors, childhood social conditions, cognitive/non- cognitive skills, and early health-explain the observed health patterns across the three education groups. This research is significant because: (1) Poorer-than-expected health in the large subbaccalaureate group must be addressed in health care policy and planning. (2) Explaining the anomalous patterns at the subbacca- laureate level can spur new theories to understand the relationship between schooling and health in general. This research is innovative because it seeks to challenge current research on the educational determinants of health by focusing on an anomaly in the gradient pattern. At the completion of this project, we will provide the first systematic assessment of the health of college dropouts and recipients of associate's degrees, as well as explore reasons why their additional schooling does not translate into a health advantage relative to HS graduates. We are thus proposing to answer an important, recently recognized issue of relatively poor health in the large subbaccalaureate group-an issue highly pertinent to NIH funding priorities, the U.S. health and educational policies, and the health of the American population-using methodologically and substantively innovative perspectives."
"9271248","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alzheimer's disease [AD] is characterized by Aß amyloid deposits in the form of extracellular amyloid ß (Aß) plaques and tau protein aggregates in the form of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). Soluble oligomeric forms of Aß and tau are the chief mediators of cytotoxicity in AD. Preclinical studies in transgenic mouse models have shown great efficacy of Aß targeting immunotherapy in the prevention of AD but clinical trials have so far failed to show benefits. We plan to test the hypothesis that for therapy to be effective the concurrent targeting of both Aß and tau related pathology is essential. Our novel active immunization approach uses a polymerized peptide derived from the carboxyl terminus of the British amyloidosis (ABri) peptide prepared by the use of glutaraldehyde as a cross linker, that results in a stabilized, predominately ß sheet oligomeric form that does not form fibrils, which we term pBri. We showed that via conformational mimicry, the pBri peptide, in its stabilized oligomeric form, can initiate a conformation selective immune response, which is specific to pathological aggregated/oligomeric conformers of phosphorylated tau and Aß. In the last funding period we have also shown that stimulation of innate immunity via TLR9 can reduce plaques and tau pathology in Tg2576 and 3xTg mice. The specific aims are: 1) Test conformation targeted active immunization with pBri in htau/PS1 Tg and Tg4510 mice with extensive NFT pathology, as well as in a model of Lewy body pathology (tTA/A53Ta-syn) in order to determine if our novel active immunization approach is effective against tau and a- synuclein related pathology. 2) Characterize our panel of monoclonal anti-pathological conformation antibodies using human tissue, Western blots, laser capture microdissection and surface plasmon resonance measurements. The best mAb will be tested in Tg mouse models. 3) We will determine if our method of stimulating innate immunity via TLR9 with CpG is effective at ameliorating vascular amyloid in TgSwDI mice and tau pathology in Tg4510 mice. These planned studies will provide essential data on three therapeutic approaches that concurrently target Aß and tau pathology prior to potential testing in humans."
"9301688","PROJECT SUMMARY Heart attack, or acute myocardial infarction (AMI), is a leading cause of death in the United States, with over 700,000 victims every year. The most prevalent cause of AMI is progressive thrombotic coronary artery occlusion, also known as ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). Early therapy to promote heart reperfusion can dramatically improve outcomes. While percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is preferred for early arterial recanalization, up to 70% of patients present to hospitals without this capability, and many STEMI victims must rely on thrombolytic therapy alone. However, current thrombolytics such as tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) are not fully effective, and many patients are excluded from thrombolytic therapy altogether due to bleeding concerns. Consequently, a major treatment gap exists for hemostatically safe antithrombotic and thrombolytic drugs that can be used alone or that can improve the efficacy of current treatments without increased bleeding. To directly address this need, our company has been developing a first- in-class antithrombotic agent for the safe treatment of heart attack. The product candidate is a bioengineered recombinant selective protein C activator enzyme that has potent antithrombotic effects without increasing hemorrhagic risks. Our proprietary molecule, ProCase (E-WE thrombin) has been designed to act in part by increasing the surface concentration of the anticoagulant, profibrinolytic, and cytoprotective enzyme, endogenous activated protein C (APC), at the site of developing blood clots via targeted cellular delivery. This unique mechanism of action allows E-WE thrombin to target pathological blood clots without disabling vital hemostasis. In primates, doses as low as 1 µg/kg are antithrombotic without systemic anticoagulation or any antihemostatic effects. All of the critical milestones for our Fast-Track SBIR Phase I/II grant have been reached to justify progression to Phase IIB by demonstrating: 1) E-WE thrombin is effective in a mouse AMI model; 2) E-WE thrombin safely interrupts vascular graft thrombo-occlusion in primates; 3) Our sensitive blood assay can measure drug exposure levels in plasma; and 4) Limited repeat administration of E-WE thrombin does not evoke an immune response in primates. Our Phase IIB aims that will support critical product development milestones are to: 1) Determine the antithrombotic efficacy and hemostatic safety of combining E-WE thrombin plus tPA in primates; 2) Complete a bridging preclinical GLP toxicology study of E-WE thrombin combined with tPA; and 3) Transfer E-WE thrombin manufacturing to a facility capable of commercial scale production. We are currently at a critical juncture for advancing E-WE thrombin towards human trials to treat STEMI, and ultimately all acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients. This SBIR Phase IIB Bridge Award, matched by a combination of already secured and pending funds, will lead directly to the initiation of clinical trials investigating this unique and potentially life-saving antithrombotic drug candidate."
"9373563","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Our work and that of others demonstrate that older men and women with lower extremity peripheral artery disease (PAD) have greater functional impairment and more rapid functional decline than older people without PAD. The functional impairments documented in older people with PAD are associated with mobility loss, increased mortality, and poor quality of life. Yet only two medications are FDA approved for improving the walking limitations associated with PAD.  Pre-clinical evidence shows that cocoa and its major flavanol component, epicatechin, have therapeutic properties that target pathophysiologic impairments in PAD. These therapeutic properties include improved skeletal muscle mitochondrial function, increased skeletal muscle capillary density, and favorable changes in skeletal muscle levels of myostatin and follistatin that increase muscle mass and strength. Cocoa also protects against ischemia-reperfusion injury, improves endothelial function, and reduces oxidative stress. In summary, epicatechin-rich cocoa targets and reverses several pathophysiologic processes that are common in PAD and that are associated with functional impairment and functional decline in PAD. However, the effect of chronic daily cocoa consumption on functional decline has not been studied in older people with PAD.  We propose a pilot study of 44 PAD participants age 65 and older: a double-blind, randomized controlled pilot clinical trial to provide preliminary data to address our hypothesis that chronic daily epicatechin-rich cocoa improves lower extremity functioning in older people with PAD by improving mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, increasing calf muscle capillary density, promoting calf skeletal muscle mitochondrial biogenesis, and improving endothelial function.  In our primary aim, we will determine whether PAD participants randomized to an epicatechin-rich cocoa beverage have greater increases or smaller declines in six-minute walk performance at 6-month follow-up, compared to those randomized to an identical appearing placebo drink with comparable caloric composition. In our secondary aims, we will determine whether PAD participants randomized to cocoa have improved treadmill walking performance, improved brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, and favorable changes in calf muscle biopsy measures of mitochondrial function, mitochondrial biogenesis, follistatin, myostatin, and capillary density. Ou outcome measures will be carefully timed relative to the last intervention dose to distinguish between the acute vs. chronic effects of cocoa-epicatechin.  If our hypotheses are correct, results will be used to design a large, definitive randomized controlled trial of epicatechin-rich cocoa to improve lower extremity functioning and prevent mobility loss in the large and growing number of older people who are disabled by PAD."
"9328212","PROJECT SUMMARY Approximately 10 million Americans are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid. These dual-eligibles are a disproportionately high-cost population with substantial and often unmet healthcare needs. They are also more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities and experience potentially-preventable hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) visits resulting from disparities in access to primary care. However, relatively little is known about the relationship between primary care access and the broader continuum of potentially-preventable hospital care, which includes not only ED visits and hospitalizations, but also observation stays, 30-day return ED visits, and 30-day all-cause readmissions. Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs) are ?safety net? providers that receive federal funding to provide primary care to underserved populations without regard for patients' ability to pay. FQHCs are known to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare access and quality, but dual-eligibles' use of FQHCs has not been well studied. Moreover, modifiable organizational characteristics that may explain variations in FQHC performance related to reducing disparities are not well understood. Thus, the objective of this study is to characterize and evaluate the role of FQHCs in providing primary care that lowers rates of?and reduces racial/ethnic disparities in?hospital care among dual-eligibles. The proposed study has three specific aims: 1) To determine the extent to which FQHCs reduce hospital care relative to receiving care from other primary care providers; 2) To determine the extent to which racial/ethnic disparities in hospital care are reduced among FQHC users relative to those receiving care from other primary care providers; and 3) To determine the extent to which organizational characteristics enhance the ability of FQHCs to reduce hospital care and related racial/ethnic disparities in care. Using seven years of Medicare claims data (2012 ? 2018) rates of?and disparities in?hospital care will be modeled as a function of FQHC use and other primary care sources. The extent to which disparities exist within or between FQHCs will also be assessed. Finally, FQHC-specific hospital care rates will be modeled as a function of FQHC characteristics using Medicare claims and FQHC data from the Uniform Data System. The proposed study is significant, because it will provide evidence of the relative effectiveness of FQHCs at lowering rates of?and reducing racial/ethnic disparities in?hospital care and identify modifiable characteristics of high-performing FQHCs for dissemination as best practices. The proposed study is innovative because it is the first to examine the relationship between FQHC use and racial/ethnic disparities in the broader continuum of hospital care among dual-eligibles using quasi-experimental methods (i.e., instrumental variable and difference-in-differences analyses) to address selection bias, and the first to model organizational disparities in hospital care rates across FQHCs as a function of FQHC characteristics. This study is expected to have an immediate positive impact for CMS policymakers, state Medicaid agencies, providers (particularly FQHCs), hospitals, and dual-eligible patients."

"9264446","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the first cycle of our R01 we demonstrated that the transactive response DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43) influences memory loss and hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This showed that TDP-43 plays a key role in neurodegeneration in AD and represents an important new treatment target for AD. This work, however, was limited to subjects with advanced neuropathological stages of AD. If treating AD is going to be successful, there needs to be advancement in our understanding of how TDP-43 interacts with the other AD associated proteins of tau and beta-amyloid (Aß) to affect neurodegeneration across the entire spectrum of AD neuropathologic changes. The primary goal of our second cycle is therefore to determine how TDP-43, tau and Aß interact to account for neurodegeneration across all levels of AD neuropathologic changes. We aim to investigate the relationship between the frequency, burden and topographic distribution of TDP-43 and the topographic distributions of tau and Aß, and assess how these three proteins interact and influence clinical, neuropsychological and neuroimaging outcomes. We also aim to investigate whether neurodegeneration in AD is dependent on the ratio of C to N terminal TDP-43 specie, or TDP-43 subtype (A- D). To accomplish our aims we will perform pathological analyses on a cohort of 768 cases that have been prospectively recruited and autopsied between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2013 at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota. All 768 cases have already undergone a standard neuropathological assessment and been assigned a Braak neurofibrillary tangle stage measuring the distribution of tau deposition. For the renewal, we will perform Thal staging to assess Aß distribution on all 768 cases. TDP-43 immunohistochemistry was already performed on 342 cases in the first cycle, and so for this cycle we will perform TDP-43 immunohistochemistry on the remaining 426 cases to assess for 1) the presence of TDP-43, 2) TDP-43 distribution and assign each case a TDP-43 in AD stage, 3) TDP-43 burden in the hippocampus, 4) TDP-43 specie and 5) TDP-43 subtype. Clinical data will be abstracted for each case and tensor-based morphometry will be utilized to calculate volumes of the hippocampus and neocortex on all available MRI scans for each case. Statistical models will be utilized to assess the relationships between TDP-43, tau and Aß, accounting for other potentially confounding pathologies such as Lewy bodies, vascular disease and hippocampal sclerosis, and their relationship to cognitive impairment and brain atrophy across the AD neuropathologic spectrum. Ultimately, we aim to generate a model demonstrating how TDP-43, tau and Aß influence hippocampal and neocortical atrophy with disease duration. Findings from this R01 will significantly improve understanding of how these three potential molecular targets interact to influence the AD neurodegenerative process. Given that these proteins currently have the greatest potential as therapeutic targets for the treatment of AD, our R01 has potential for significant public health impact."
"9206877","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):        Background/Rationale: Angiogenesis - formation of new capillary blood vessels is a fundamental process essential for healing of tissue injury, e.g. gastric erosions (GE) and ulcers (GU). Gastric mucosa of aging humans and rats (aging gastric mucosa) exhibits increased susceptibility to injury, impaired angiogenesis and delayed healing. [Our overall hypothesis is that nerve growth factor (NGF) is critical for gastric endothelial cell (EC) viability, function, angiogenesis and GU healing, and that NGF deficiency in aging ECs is the major mechanism of aging-related impairment of gastric angiogenesis and GU healing in aging individuals.] The rationale for this hypothesis stems from our preliminary studies showing that: 1) aging gastric ECs (AGECs) have reduced expression of NGF, and NGF protein and/or NGF gene therapy restores in vitro angiogenesis in aging ECs cells and reverses NSAIDs-induced inhibition of angiogenesis, and [2) local treatment of GU in aging rats with NGF significantly increases local expression of NGF and VEGF, angiogenesis, accelerates ulcer healing, and improves mucosal regeneration.] Our specific objectives are to determine whether and to what extent: 1) NGF and its signaling are critical for gastric ECs viability, function and angiogenesis and to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms; 2) NGF deficiency is: (a) crucial mechanism for ECs' aging and for aging-related impairment of EC proliferation and angiogenesis and (b) whether NGF treatment or NGF gene therapy restores in vitro angiogenesis in aging ECs; [3) Local treatment of GUs in aging rats with NGF will improve vascular regeneration and GU healing and whether these events can be visualized in vivo and in real time using confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE).] Our long-term objective is to uncover novel mechanisms that regulate gastric angiogenesis and its impairment in aging, to provide a basis for the therapeutic use of NGF to improve angiogenesis and healing of GU in aging individuals and to use CLE for in vivo assessment of GU healing, vascular regeneration and for identifying GU scar abnormalities that may be the basis for the ulcer recurrence. Design: Since ECs are critical targets and effectors of angiogenesis, in in vitro studies in ECs isolated from gastric mucosa of young and aging rats we will determine the mechanisms underlying aging related impairment of EC functions, expression of NGF, VEGF, their receptors, PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling, and the role of NGF in EC survival, migration, proliferation and angiogenesis. Next we will examine in vivo in aging and young rats sequential events of GU healing and vascular regeneration and will determine whether locally injected NGF will improve GU healing in aging rats and prevent NSAIDs-induced GU recurrence. We will also determine human relevance of our experimental findings using human specimens of GUs from young and aging individuals. Significance: The central topic of our project is neovascularization, injury healing and impact of aging. In 2006, ~39 million Americans (12% of population) were 65 years of age or older, and this number is projected to reach ~70 million by 2030. This population is at high risk of tissue and organ injuries, and GU complications. Impaired angiogenesis in aging is a key factor in delayed healing, morbidity and mortality. [Recent studies indicate that the incidence of non-H. pylori, non-NSAIDs ulcers (idiopathic ulcers) is increasing and they constitute up to 30% of all ulcers and patients with a history of idiopathic bleeding ulcers have a high risk of recurrent ulcer bleeding and a high mortality 83 - 92%. Therefore the GU recurrence and its complications still remain important clinical issue, especially in aging and severely ill patients.] The proposed studies will provide insight into novel mechanisms and the regulatory role of NGF and angiogenesis in GU healing and their relation to aging-related impairment of these processes. This novel information can be applicable to other areas of mucosal healing including inflammatory bowel disease, esophageal erosions and ulcers, as well as to cancer-related neovascularization."
"9204207","Summary (OVERALL) The introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in the mid-1990's has had a dramatic impact on the natural history of HIV infection and HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). While the overall mortality and the incidence of ESRD attributed to HIVAN has decreased, the incidence of all cause ESRD among HIV-infected patients has not changed and remains significantly higher than that observed in the general population. With prolonged survival and aging of the HIV population, non-AIDS complications including kidney disease have emerged as major contributors to morbidity and mortality and continue to disproportionately affect individuals of African origin. The latter can at least partially be explained by the strong association of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in APOL1 with idiopathic and HIV-associated FSGS in African- Americans, although the mechanism remains unknown. This Program Project Grant will investigate the long-term consequences of chronic HIV infection on the kidney including contribution to chronic kidney disease, critical host factors that influence that interaction as well as the role the kidney plays as a long-term, potentially latent reservoir for the virus that could drive chronic inflammation. Critical observations made in the prior funding cycle have contributed to the work proposed including the observation that HIV infection accelerates the progression of kidney disease in the setting of diabetes and that HIV completes a virus life cycle in the kidney, induces inflammation and in the kidney and can become latent in a subset of renal tubule epithelial cells. Key Inflammatory pathways induced by HIV have been defined in renal tubule epithelial cells and in podocytes providing insights for possible interventions that will be explored. New preliminary data in the HIV transgenic murine model has demonstrated an interaction between host microbiome and kidney pathogenesis. Through three highly interactive projects (and two linked RO-1s) and four essential cores, with investigators that have a strong track record of collaboration, we will explore the hypothesis that chronic infection with HIV, even under complete viral suppression, has long-term consequences in the kidney, both by promoting CKD (Project 4) and by providing a long-term reservoir for the virus that promotes chronic inflammation (Project 2 and linked RO-1) and that critical host factors influence these consequences including APOL1 variants (linked RO-1) and host microbiome (Project 3). Engineered transformed and primary cells, transgenic murine models and human samples provided by Core C with biopsy histopathology determined by the histopathology Core (B) will be used to explore the hypotheses proposed. An informatics Core (D) will provide critical and innovative analyses of in vitro and in vivo derived data sets. A multi-modality communications and data sharing plan will allow continuous review of data and sharing of experimental approaches and data to move the science forward. This PPG addresses important challenges in HIV and CKD research, including the intersection of HIV and progression of chronic diseases associated with aging, as well as the recognition that cure initiatives require a complete understanding of the implications of HIV in chronic reservoirs."
"9355088","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal focus on the cellular properties of neurons of Barrington's nucleus (BRN) and their responses to afferent or pharmacological stimulation. BRN neurons are positioned to coordinate micturition with arousal and voiding behaviors as they innervate the preganglionic neurons that regulate detrusor contraction as well as the locus coeruleus (LC), the major brain norepinephrine nucleus. Dysfunctions in this circuit may also underlie bladder and voiding disorders, particularly Underactive Bladder (UAB). We will take advantage of technical advances combining genetics, optical stimulation and imaging to elucidate how this nucleus functions and how it can be manipulated to treat disorders such as UAB. As the majority of BRN neurons express the stress related neuropeptide, corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), they can be easily identified and studied in brain slices from mice with CRF-Cre dependent expression of fluorescence reporter proteins. The close proximity of the LC and BRN in these slices we will allow us to directly quantify the relationship between BRN and LC neurons and to better understand this central branch of the micturition reflex. In aim one we will characterize with patch clamp recordings the cellular properties of neurons in the BRN-LC circuit and how they change with aging. This will be paired with immunocytochemical (IHC) determination of neurotransmitter phenotype. We hypothesize that the majority of BRN neurons co-localize CRF and glutamate. Then we will use CRF- Channelrhodopsin 2 mice to control CRF expressing BRN neurons with different frequencies of optical stimulation and quantify their synaptic action in the LC. In aim two using CRF-GCaMP6f mice that express a Ca2+ indicator in CRF neurons we will be able to investigate the functional BRN circuitry as it modifies with age and thus identify cellular changes in the pontine micturition center that may be causal to age-related UAB. Our exploratory proposal will provide us with the conceptual framework and essential preliminary data to develop a mechanistic knowledge of the functional and pharmacological regulation of the BRN circuitry relevant for the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of UAB. The goal of the application is to set the stage for a combined in vitro and in vivo approach to the understanding of the role of the pontine micturition center in UAB."
"9271142","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed research seeks to determine how adverse social environments influence the risk of inflammation-related disease by up-regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. These studies test the hypothesis that adverse social environments stimulate the hematopoietic production of immature pro-inflammatory monocytes (CD16- in humans, Ly-6c-high in mice) via threat-induced activation of beta-adrenergic receptors in bone marrow myelopoietic cells. Specific aims will: (Aim 1) Define the neural and endocrine pathways by which chronic threat up-regulates pro-inflammatory monocytes; (Aim 2) Define the specific beta-adrenergic receptors and target cell types mediating threat-induced expansion of pro- inflammatory monocytes; and (Aim 3) Define the myelopoietic molecules mediating beta-adrenergic expansion of pro-inflammatory monocytes (including GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and the CXCL12/CXCR4 chemokine signaling axis). When complete, these studies will provide an integrated mechanistic model of the neural / hematopoietic pathway by which chronic adversity can up-regulate inflammatory gene expression in circulating immune cells. The overarching goal of these studies is to develop a comprehensive theory that explains how common social risk factors can influence multiple inflammation-related diseases. In addition to clarifying the basic physiologic mechanisms involved in defensive programming of the immune system transcriptome, these studies will identify specific CNS mechanisms (e.g., Crf gene activation in central nucleus of the amygdala), pharmacologic intervention strategies (e.g., beta-2 and beta-3 adrenergic antagonists, and antagonists of GM-CSF, TGF-beta, and/or CXCR4), and mechanistic biomarkers (e.g., myelopoietic molecules and circulating monocyte phenotypes) that can be applied in future studies to clarify how stress-induced up- regulation of pro-inflammatory monocytes impacts specific inflammation-related diseases such as atherosclerosis, Type II diabetes, Alzheimer's disease, and cancer."

"9338097","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Mounting evidence suggests that microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation may contribute to psychiatric disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Although modulations of miRNA function have generated promising clinical data for several diseases, miRNA?s role in Alzheimer?s disease (AD) has not been investigated thoroughly. Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) genotype is the strongest genetic risk factor for AD. In addition to ApoE isoform, alterations in ApoE levels and lipidation status have been shown to influence A? aggregation. We and others reported the critical roles of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) in regulating ApoE lipidation and A? levels in the brain and its therapeutic potential. Increasing evidence suggests that neuroinflammation plays a critical role in AD pathogenesis. Therefore, targeting inflammatory pathways is an emerging therapeutic strategy, along with the direct targeting of ApoE/A? pathway, for AD therapy. Recently, we found that miR-33 gene deletion significantly increases ABCA1 levels and soluble A? clearance, leading to reduction of soluble A? levels in the brain of APP/PS1 mouse model. We also identified that miR-33 regulates neuroinflammation by directly targeting transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) receptor 1 (TGF?R1) gene. Here, we now seek to define the role of miR-33 in ApoE and Amyloid ? (A?) metabolism in mice (Aim 1) and neuroinflammation (Aim 2). In Aim 1, we will use ABCA1 knockout and ApoE knockout mice along with miR-33 knockout mouse models. In Aim 2, we will use TGF?R1 knockout mouse model. Importantly, we demonstrated that antisense oligonucleotide (ASO)-based pharmacological inhibition of miR-33 efficiently increases ABCA1 levels and reduces soluble A? levels in the brain. In Aim 3, we will assess the effect of long-term treatment of anti-miR-33 ASO on A? deposition, neuroinflammation, and behavior in mice. We will assess the preventive and therapeutic effect by treating anti-miR-33 ASO before and after the development of A? plaques and memory deficits in APP/PS1 mice."
"9453749","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):     An important goal of The National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) is to foster the development of new approaches for drug addiction treatment and prevention. Our Center will advance this objective by providing an enabling resource for NIDA and NIH investigators for accelerating the progress of their addiction research, including but not limited to the discovery and characterization of novel small molecule compounds. The primary areas of focus of our program are the gene families represented by orphan and identified Seven Transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) as well as nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. With NIDA support of our Duke P30 Center over, the past four years, we have established and maintained a cDNA collection containing the open reading frames for almost all human addiction associated GPCRs, and more importantly an expanding repository of off-the shelf cell-based assays for the GPCR targets of interest to NIDA funded scientists. Our efforts have produced collaborations with NIH/NIDA chemists and biologists at multiple other institutions, including multiple projects with the Molecular Libraries Probe Production Centers Network (MLPCN) that resulted in the discovery of novel probe compounds for the KOR, GPRs 33, 55, and the neurotensin 1 receptor. To continue our mission of providing a pharmacological treatment for drug addiction and maintaining our operation at current levels, we are seeking a renewal of funding as a NIDA P30 Center of Excellence that will enable our Center to remain at the forefront of drug addiction research. The primary scope of our work would include the identification and in cellulo and in vivo characterization of novel tool compounds using addiction models. Our specific aims remain, to develop, maintain, and provide receptor cDNA and cell assay libraries, for immediate access by NID/VNIH investigators, to screen in a timely manner (days to weeks turnaround) the receptor targets provided by our collaborators against limited libraries (1000-5,000 compounds) provided by us or those scientists; and establish collaborative projects aimed towards the discovery and characterization of novel compounds targeting addictive behaviors including the new assays and technologies that will facilitate those discoveries. This strategy will expedite the identification of preclinical compounds as well as tool compounds to characterize the biology of addiction and provide an educational resource for collaborating scientists in drug discovery technology."
"9344524","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this project is to dissect the age-related changes in immune cells that affect responses to microbial vaccination in the elderly. Aging is associated with a decline in the ability to combat infections and is linked with at least two immune alterations: immunosenescence, or the functional decline of the immune system over time; and inflammaging, a chronic inflammation status believed to trigger major age-related chronic diseases. These alterations may explain insufficient responses to microbial vaccines in the elderly, leaving this population highly vulnerable to the consequences of serious infections like S. pneumoniae, the focus of the current study. Indeed, S. pneumoniae causes significant morbidity and mortality in the elderly, and the two currently approved pneumococcal vaccines-PPSV23 (Pneumovax(r)) and PCV13 (Prevnar(r))-have been used with mixed success in this population. For example, while PPSV23 is efficacious in healthy young adults, several studies have shown decreased efficacy in elderly. There, it prevents pneumococcal bacteremia in elderly, but does not reduce the risk of Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). PCV13 was recently reported to reduce by ~50% vaccine-type pneumococcal, bacteremic and non-bacteremic CAP, but still left a significant subset of individuals underprotected. The underlying reasons for the suboptimal efficacy of these two vaccines is unclear. It is possible that they elict qualitatively and quantitatively different immune responses, but this remains to be established. Furthermore, no definitive conclusions can be drawn as to their comparative efficacy in the elderly, since in all studies in elderly cohorts each vaccine was compared to placebo and not each other. Thus, many questions as to the nature of (and variability in) vaccine responsiveness remain unanswered. Our hypothesis is that the altered immune responses of the elderly to pneumococcal vaccines are caused by genomic alterations associated with aging that result in dysfunction in one or more of three immune cell types-antigen presenting cells (APCs), follicular helper T cells (Tfh) and B cells-critical for adaptive immunity. We propose three Specific Aims to test our hypothesis - Aim 1: To vaccinate healthy elderly with two distinct pneumococcal vaccines, collect longitudinal blood samples and assess pneumococcal-specific antibody responses; Aim 2: To establish the transcriptional and epigenetic profiles of elderly blood immune cells linked with antibody responses to pneumococcal vaccination; and Aim 3: To examine the functional status of immune cells in the elderly stratified according to their pneumococcal vaccine responder status. Our approach integrates flow cytometry and other functional assessments with cutting-edge genomic approaches, and is designed to yield in-depth phenotypic, transcriptional, epigenetic and functional data for these three key immune cell types. These efforts are poised to yield unprecedented large-scale datasets and knowledge concerning immune responses in healthy elderly."

"9206075","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a poorly understood neurodegenerative disease with no effective treatment. ALS is connected with military service and veterans are at a higher risk of contracting this debilitating disease. Mutations in several genes have been discovered to cause a subset of familial ALS, including copper- zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1), fused in sarcoma (FUS), and TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43). Studying familial ALS using the well-defined genetic models will provide critical insights into the disease pathology as well as novel targets for future therapeutic development.  This project is focused on the RNA binding protein FUS that has been implicated in both familial and sporadic ALS. Since FUS mutations were found in a subset of familial ALS patients in 2009, mislocalization of mutant FUS in the cytoplasm has been considered a hallmark of this subset (Type 6) of ALS. However, protein inclusions containing wild-type FUS have been reported in multiple forms of familial and sporadic ALS, suggesting that FUS plays an important role in a larger portion of ALS beyond the Type 6 familial ALS. Protein inclusions can be caused by protein over-production, inefficient protein degradation, protein mislocalization, or a combination of these defects. However, the regulation of FUS protein expression and degradation remains poorly understood. We have published that it is critical to maintain proper levels of FUS inside the nucleus and that either elevated or reduced levels of FUS causes similar degenerative phenotypes in Drosophila models. Thus we propose that maintaining appropriate FUS protein homeostasis is critical to attenuate FUS toxicity and motor neuron dysfunction. Since little is known about how FUS gene transcription and protein turnover are regulated, discoveries in this project will fill this knowledge gap and advance the field significantly.  The specific hypotheses to be tested are: FUS gene transcription is regulated by the Jak/Stat signaling cascade (Aim 1) while FUS degradation is largely mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (Aim 2). Moreover, we will test the hypothesis that FUS ubiquitination regulates its RNA binding and subcellular localization (Aim 3). We have carried out preliminary studies to show that the transcription of FUS is indeed controlled by Jak/Stat signaling and that Jak/Stat signaling attenuates FUS toxicity in Drosophila models. We also show that the degradation of FUS is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system and that FUS ubiquitination is regulated by a specific E3 ligase named FBXW7. Moreover, a dominant negative mutant FBXW7 decreased FUS ubiquitination, delayed FUS degradation and changed FUS subcellular localization. Therefore each of these three specific hypotheses is supported by our preliminary results. These inter-related pathways play a critical role in regulating FUS function and alterations in any of them will likely contribute to the pathogenesis of ALS. The results from this study will help understand how to target FUS in motor neurons, providing a new avenue to attenuate FUS toxicity in future therapeutic developments.  The proposal is constructed based on a number of novel observations, which leads to a novel hypothesis that that FUS protein biosynthesis and turnover can be modulated to attenuate FUS toxicity in ALS. An array of techniques will be employed to test the hypothesis in a combination of in vitro and in vivo models. The results from the proposed studies should yield potential new targets that can be translated into novel treatments for veteran and other ALS patients."
"9351792","Injection drug use is a major risk factor for acquisition of HIV infection in Russia where the prevalence of HCV among IV drug users can be as high as 93% and in the Perm Region the frequency of HCV coinfection among newly diagnosed HIV cases approaches 75%. Thus to understand better the pathogenesis of immune deficiency among injection drug users with HIV infection who are typically also HCV infected, it is important to have a better understanding of the determinants of immune perturbations in these populations. Attenuated CD4 T cell recovery during antiretroviral therapy (ART) administration leads to increased risk of mortality and non- AIDS-defining morbidities. As many as 30% of treated HIV infected patients experience poor CD4 restoration despite prolonged suppression of viral replication during ART and this is more likely among injection drug users, who are often HCV infected and who delay access to care. The mechanisms responsible for poor CD4 T cell recovery during ART have not been fully discerned but we have found in collaboration with Perm investigators that immune non responders (INR) have increased levels of immune activation, increased proportions of proliferating CD4+ T cells, increased expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and perturbations in T regulatory cell numbers and via transcriptional analysis, impaired regulatory signatures and expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (preliminary data). We hypothesize that persistent exposure to the inflammatory type 1 IFN that is particularly increased in HCV coinfected injection drug users impairs Treg maturation and function resulting in dysregulated T cell homeostasis, characterized by non-productive T cell proliferation (rapid cell cycle entry followed by death), and ultimately, poor CD4 T cell reconstitution in INR. We propose that chronic exposure to inflammatory cytokines impairs mitochondrial mass and function in cycling cells leading to short lived proliferating cells. We will test this hypothesis by detailed transcriptional profiling of cycling and non-cycling T regulatory cells obtained from HIV infected and HIV/HCV coinfected patients receiving care in Perm using novel methods we have developed, and by detailed multiparameter flow cytometric characterization of Treg cells using a 16 color flow panel that we have optimized. We will also test the effects of interferons and other inflammatory mediators that we have found to be elevated in HIV/HCV coinfection on regulatory T cell maturation, phenotype and mitochondrial function to provide an in vitro system to explore the mechanisms of our model. The proposed studies will clarify poorly understood determinants of immune failure in HIV and HIV/HCV infection in a setting where treatment for HCV infection is not yet broadly available. Confirming the pathophysiologic mechanisms suggested by our preliminary data may identify targets for improving immune recovery in ART-treated HIV and HIV/HCV coinfection ."

"9275409","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Metastatic melanoma is one of the fastest growing tumor types in the US, especially in Veterans, and also is one of the most challenging malignancies to treat. While there has been some recent success for melanoma tumors that carry the BRAFV600 mutation, the response is transient and treatment is complicated by development of resistance as well as secondary tumors. Both BRAFWT and BRAFV600 melanoma tumors are eligible for treatment with CTLA-4 or PD1 antibody to boost the T cell response to tumor, only 20-30 percent of the tumors respond with the 2-4 month increase in overall survival. Our preclinical experiments have focused on stopping tumor growth by blocking cell cycle with the Aurora kinase A (AURKA) inhibitor, MLN8237. Most human melanoma tumors implanted into immune deficient mice respond strongly to therapy with MLN8237, but the drug largely induces senescence and slows tumor growth, but does not cause regression. We now have strong preliminary data showing that combining the AURKA inhibitor with inhibitors of MDM2 or activators of death receptors 4 or 5 (DR4, DR5) pushes the tumor cells rendered senescent by MLN8237 into apoptosis and causes tumor regression. We now want to carryout advanced pre-clinical studies using these combinations of therapy to treat human melanoma tumor implants into mice to test the hypothesis that combining AURKA inhibitor therapy with agents that stabilize p53 by inhibition its ubiquitination by MDM2 or agents that activate DRs will provide improved therapy for late BRAFWT melanoma or melanomas that develop resistance to BRAF inhibitors. There are 3 specific aims: Aim IA: To characterize the effectiveness of combined therapy with the MDM antagonist, Nutlin-3a, and the AURKA inhibitor, MLN8237, for treatment of BRAFWT/p53WT, NRasmutant/p53WT, NRasWT/p53WT melanoma. Aim IB. To examine the effect of the Nutlin-3a and MLN8237 combination treatment on the growth of BRAFV600 /p53WT melanoma tumor implants from patients that have developed resistance to BRAF inhibitors. Aim IIA. To characterize the effects of combined treatment with MDM2 antagonist Nutlin-3a and AURKA inhibitor MLN8237 on tumor microenvironment an on melanoma metastasis. Aim IIB. To evaluate the potential for boosting the antitumor response of myeloid cells to enhance melano-ma tumor cell death in association with MLN8237 and Nutlin-3a. We will express constitutively active IKK? in myeloid cells to push them into an antitumor phenotype. Melanoma tumors growing in mice with WT or constitutively active IKK? in myeloid cells will be treated with MLN8237 and Nutlin-3a and growth of tumor and metastatic properties of tumor will be evaluated. Aim IIIA. To characterize the effectiveness of combining treatment with agonist for the death receptors DR4 and DR5 with MLN8237 for treatment of BRAFWT, NRAS WT or NRAS mutant melanoma tumors that are either p53WT or p53mutant. Aim IIIB. To evaluate the effectiveness of combined DR5, DR4 agonists with MLN8237 for BRAF inhibitor resistant BRAFV600 melanoma."
"9345476","Summary: 4-channel multimodal ultrathin-flexible SFE for cancer diagnosis and therapy  Minimally-invasive optical imaging is being advanced by molecular probes that enhance contrast using fluorescence. The applications in cancer imaging are very broad, ranging from early diagnosis of cancer to the guiding of interventions, such as surgery. The high-sensitivity afforded by wide-field fluorescence imaging using scanning laser light is being developed for these broad applications. The platform technology is the SFE (Scanning Fiber Endoscope), which places a sub-mm scanner at the tip of a highly flexible scope. Because several different laser wavelengths can be mixed and scanned together, full-color reflectance imaging can be combined with fluorescence imaging in a 4-channel multimodal SFE. The goal of this project is to develop the first prototype VerAvanti 4-channel multimodal SFE (mmSFE) for cancer imaging applications. VerAvanti is a start-up medical device company located in Redmond, WA, founded and staffed with engineering graduates from the University of Washington (UW), where the SFE was invented and tested in pilot clinical trials. VerAvanti has exclusive license to commercialize the SFE technology for medical imaging and a 3-channel full color SFE (using red, green, and blue reflectance) is already in pilot manufacturing and testing. This project will rapidly translate the mmSFE technology from its origins at UW into a working prototype by adding near infrared (NIR) fluorescence as the 4th imaging channel. Importantly the VerAvanti mmSFE will be designed for efficient manufacturing in a modular format with reduced part numbers. This will allow two very different cancer imaging applications to be commercially available for upcoming clinical trials that rely on molecular imaging of cancer. The first application is fluorescence image-guided surgery, specifically brain tumors that are labeled with BLZ- 100, a peptide probe with a NIR dye to highlight cancer cells, especially at the margin with healthy brain tissue. The ultrathin and flexible mmSFE will allow less invasive surgeries and allow the guided tool to avoid the most important areas to be left intact. VerAvanti will design and develop the prototype to specified benchmarks which will be tested at UW using realistic phantoms and feedback from clinicians. The challenge for VerAvanti is extending from 3 to 4 laser wavelengths across the visible to NIR with a clinical interface that neurosurgeons prefer. The second application is providing 3 fluorescence imaging channels concurrently with grayscale reflectance imaging for the purpose of making an accurate cancer diagnosis in the pancreatobiliary ducts that are often too small to obtain sufficient biopsy tissue. Feasibility of the modular mmSFE design using 1 to 3 fluorescence imaging channels (and reflectance for situational awareness) in a 1.5-mm diameter flexible scope will be determined, but only the mmSFE for the first application will be prototyped and neurosurgeon tested."
"9231266","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) is emerging as one of the most common liver disease in the American population. It is a metabolic disorder in which fat accumulation within the liver (steatosis) is associated with inflammation, hepatic injury  and cirrhosis without significant consumption of alcohol. Despite affecting 2-5% of the American population, there are currently no effective therapeutic treatments for NASH. Current knowledge of this disease is limited because early stages (simple steatosis) are asymptomatic and difficult to detect. Furthermore, development of effective therapeutics against NASH pathology has been slow due to lack of a feasible and robust model system. We have discovered that hepatocyte-specific ablation of SRSF1 (SRSF1 HKO), a splicing regulatory protein, triggers severe and early onset of NASH phenotype. SRSF1 plays direct roles in both constitutive and alternative splicing and has recently been shown to also regulate translation and non-sense mediated decay of specific transcripts. Although the structural and functional roles of SRSF1 in splicing are extensively characterized, its role in tissue physiology is not well understood. The overall objective of this proposal is to determine the pathogenic mechanism(s) by which loss of SRSF1 results in NASH. Aim 1. We will first determine the underlying molecular irregularities promoting liver damage in our mouse model. Using an in vivo viral mediated SRSF1 HKO model, I will identify which of the activated mechanisms are primary versus secondary responses to loss of SRSF1 activity. We also have preliminary data which shows that MALAT1, a long non-coding RNA, has lost association to nuclear speckles in the SRSF1 HKO hepatocytes. Speckles are highly dynamic nuclear domains enriched with pre-mRNA splicing factors, RNA processing factors and RNA molecules including MALAT1. We will further investigate speckle composition in SRSF1 HKO hepatocytes and determine if loss of MALAT1 localization to speckles has direct implications in the development of NASH pathology. Aim 2. Secondly, we will construct the gene network regulated by SRSF1 by performing high-resolution RNA-Seq on hepatocytes isolated from wildtype and SRSF1 HKO mice. We will also determine direct mRNA targets of SRSF1 using iCLIP-Seq, a method used to identify protein-RNA interactions in living cells. Data from both of these approaches will allow for the construction ofa robust gene regulatory network. This network will provide insights into the molecular mechanisms resulting in the activation of cellular responses identified in Aim 1. Aim 3. Finally, we will determine which of SRSF1's functions, splicing or translation regulation, is crucial for maintaining normal hepatocyte function. This will be achieved using mutant constructs, which have either altered splicing and/or translation regulation activities. We will introduce these constructs to SRSF1 HKO livers in vivo and perform similar assays described in Aim 1. Results of these experiments will be compared to determine the contributions of SRSF1's splicing and translation regulatory functions in maintaining liver homeostasis."
"9254357","ABSTRACT In this Phase I SBIR application, ViVita Technologies, Inc. (Davis, CA) aims to validate our patented technology (ViVita Process ? US 9,220,733) toward development of an immune-compatible xenogeneic leaflet biomaterial for heart valve replacements. In the U.S., 100,000 heart valve replacement procedures are performed annually, a $755 million burden. Although current bioprostheses (glutaraldehyde-fixed bovine pericardium (Fixed BP) or porcine aortic valve) are superior to mechanical alternatives, the fixation process only permits longevity of ~10 years due to chronic immune rejection of the biomaterial and resultant mechanical failure. Further, this fixation process renders the material incompatible with recipient cellular regeneration and repair. These deficiencies have led the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute: Cardiac Surgery Working Group to recommend future support of basic biomaterial research for heart valve prostheses. To avoid aggressive rejection of implanted untreated, animal tissues, decellularization protocols focused on removal of immunogenic cellular components; however, persistence of both cellular and non-cellular immunogenic components following decellularization have been demonstrated to elicit in vivo immune responses. By targeting removal of the immunological barriers themselves, the ViVita Process is capable of producing unfixed biomaterials (ViVita BP) that avoid the rapid immune destruction experienced by transplanted animal tissues. The ViVita Process eliminates the two most critical barriers to discordant xenotransplantation (galactose-?(1,3)-galactose (?-gal) and major histocompatibility complex I (MHC I)), and removes 80% of hydrophilic and 60% of lipophilic minor histocompatibility xenoantigens from ViVita BP, while maintaining native extracellular matrix (ECM) structure- function relationships. In a leporine model, ViVita BP elicited minimal graft-specific adaptive immune response, absence of associated calcification, and innate immune recognition as self in origin, facilitating integration with recipient tissue. In a porcine carotid defect model, these benefits resulted in rapid vascular regeneration. This proposal will determine the extent to which preservation of native ECM functional properties will allow ViVita BP heart valve leaflets to meet or exceed all in vitro ISO 5840-2:2015 valve hydrodynamic performance assessments (Aim 1). Specifically, we will compare ViVita BP to current FDA-approved materials, and identify the correlation between flexural and hemodynamic properties. Further, this proposal will determine the extent to which native ECM preservation and reduced antigenicity will prevent destructive recipient in vivo graft-specific innate and adaptive immune responses to ViVita BP, thereby fostering regenerative responses (Aim 2). Specifically, recipient adaptive, innate, and regenerative responses to ViVita BP and Fixed BP will be quantified in an ovine intravascular model. Both Aims will be performed in collaboration with our strategic partner: Edwards Lifesciences. Successful completion of this Phase 1 proposal will provide critical validation of ViVita BP as a next generation heart valve leaflet biomaterial."
"9327707","Title: Selective Strategies for Mycobacterial Cell Wall Labeling 7. Project Summary/Abstract Up to 2 billion people worldwide are infected by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the bacterial agent of TB. Typical treatments for TB require multiple drugs taken over several months, demonstrating the unique efficacy of Mtb as a pathogen. Studying features essential to the virulence and vitality of Mtb at a molecular level can provide fundamental knowledge about how mycobacteria survive and evolve despite harsh growth conditions and exposure to drug treatment courses. The cell wall of Mtb has been implicated in promoting survival inside lung tissues, and presents a significant barrier to the ability to use diagnostic probes and therapeutic efforts to combat TB. Direct observation of changes in structure and dynamics of the cell wall under conditions relevant to infection (i.e. live macrophage hosts) can provide critical information regarding how this structure responds to drug treatment and the harsh conditions presented by the immune system. This information can be applied towards establishing better methods for diagnosing and treating TB. Bioorthogonal reactions are an attractive technology that enables direct visualization of discrete cellular structures. However, labeling the cell wall of Mtb residing inside host cells is a significant challenge. This proposal seeks to establish imaging strategies using bioorthogonal reactivity for the fluorescent labeling of independent cell wall components of Mtb inside macrophage hosts. Central to this proposal is the ability to use the natural biosynthetic machinery of Mtb to incorporate chemical reporters and fluorophores into the outer glycolipids of the cell envelope. A library of trehalose-conjugated reporters and trehalose-conjugated fluorophores will be designed, synthesized and tested using this metabolic labeling strategy. A similar approach will then be used to fluorescently label peptidoglycan simultaneously with the trehalose glycolipids. Rational molecular design and reaction optimization that enables two simultaneous bioorthogonal reactions to install fluorophores suitable for two- wavelength imaging will be carried out. The invention of a dual labeling strategy will allow for direct imaging of two crucial cell wall components of mycobacteria inside live macrophages. Subsequently, the behavior of these two cell wall components will be investigated as a function of drug treatment and environmental stress using these labeling strategies to directly inform on cell wall structure and metabolism. Through fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery experiments, a model for how multiple cell wall components change over time will be established. Further examination into the defense mechanisms that necessitate multiple drug cocktails to treat TB, as well as how Mtb responds to drug treatments through changes in the cell wall structure, will also be conducted. This research will establish an enabling technology to provide answers to questions regarding the efficacy of Mtb and insight that could lead to improved TB treatment efforts."
"9327020","Abstract Chlamydia trachomatis (Ct) is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted infection in the U.S., is a major cause of infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and ectopic pregnancy among women and has been associated with increased HIV acquisition. Because women experience the most severe sequelae, the focus of Ct prevention in the U.S. has been on screening sexually active women < 25 years old. Though men are reservoirs of the infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have not recommended targeting men due to lack of evidence for this approach. This research will fill this gap. African American (AA) women are 7.5 times more likely to be infected with Ct than whites, thus AA are the focus of this research. We hypothesize that screening AA men is essential to curbing the high rates of Ct among young AA women and that a bundled approach will by synergistic. Our community-based pilot program, called ?Check it,? is a pilot- tested male screening program which targeted AA men aged 15-25. At the core of this intervention is male Ct screening, but it is also bundled with other evidence-based and best practices for Ct control including: venue- based sampling (VBS), social network peer referral, modest monetary incentives (MMI), screening of target men, rescreening of target men found to be Ct positive with text reminders (Text-RS) , expedited treatment for index men (EIT) and for the partners (EPT), and Wed-based education (Web-Ed). The goal of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a pilot-tested, bundled Ct prevention program focusing on screening young AA men for the prevention of Ct among young AA women: Aim 1. To determine the impact of Check it on women's Ct rates ? This aim has a formative phase and an intervention phase. In the formative phase, the pilot Check it is developed and manualized. In the intervention, Check it is implemented and evaluated. We hypothesize that, post-intervention, Ct rates among AA women in the intervention community will be significantly lower compared to rates in the control communities, and that Check it will result in high rates of index/partner treatment and rescreening. Aim 2. To model the potential impact and optimal coverage needed - Using inputs from this study and the literature, a deterministic population-based epidemiological model will be used to model the number of cases averted by Check it and to determine the potential impact at different intensities of the intervention. Aim 3. To determine the cost effectiveness of Check it - Time motion studies will be conducted and used as inputs for the cost-benefit/effectiveness analysis of the Check it Program in order to distinguish study from program costs. If Check it is found to be effective as hypothesized, we will conduct future translational research to disseminate the program. This research has the potential for practical application by improving reproductive health and high impact by removing disparities in the control of Ct among AA men. ."
"9333758","PROJECT SUMMARY The central objective of this renewal R01 project is to elucidate the variation and regulation of alternative splicing (AS) in human transcriptomes. Eukaryotic cells generate astonishing regulatory diversity and complex phenotypes from a finite set of genes. AS of precursor mRNA is a mechanism essential for generating this regulatory diversity. Almost all multi-exon human genes are alternatively spliced. Widespread changes in AS occur between species, within human populations, in response to developmental signals and environmental perturbations, and in disease pathogenesis. Despite the importance of AS in gene regulation and disease, as well as extensive interest and research activities in this field, there remain many open questions and significant knowledge gaps regarding the landscape, regulation, and functional consequence of AS variation in human transcriptomes. Powerful sequencing technologies for characterizing transcriptome complexity (RNA-seq) and protein-RNA interaction (CLIP-seq), as well as the vast amounts of data continuously deposited into the public domain, create exciting and unprecedented opportunities for studies of AS. This proposal integrates data- driven research leveraging big transcriptome data with hypothesis-driven research using molecular and genomic tools. In three aims, we will investigate the evolution of AS in primates (Aim 1), the genetic variation and phenotypic association of AS in human populations (Aim 2), and epigenetic regulation of AS across human tissues and cell states (Aim 3). We will also develop and disseminate innovative computational and statistical methods for analyzing AS using large, heterogeneous sequencing datasets. As in our previous funding cycle, we will tap into our extensive network of expert collaborators to amplify the impact of our work and pursue new research opportunities within and beyond the scope of the proposed project. Collectively, our research will generate significant novel insights into the variation, regulation, and function of AS, and create broadly applicable computational tools for studying AS variation and mRNA isoform complexity in diverse biomedical disciplines."
"9275425","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Combat-related PTSD remains a significant and growing problem in the OIF/OEF veteran population. Understanding biological mechanisms that underlie risk for PTSD and modulate treatment responses will aid in (1) identification of novel treatment strategies and (2) enable individualized treatment approaches for PTSD. A polymorphism in the coding region of the catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT) gene, COMTval158met, has recently been linked to risk for PTSD across 3 separate studies. Carriers homozygous for the methionine (Met) allele are more prevalent in PTSD patient populations, with the Met allele increasing risk of responding to moderate trauma exposure. Healthy Met/Met carriers exhibit abnormalities in fear extinction and Met/Met carriers with panic disorder exhibit reduced responses to exposure therapy. Hence, disruptions in fear extinction processes may explain why Met carriers exhibit increased risk for PTSD. The mechanisms by which COMTval158met alters risk for PTSD and affects fear learning processes are not understood. The COMTval158met polymorphism is a coding mutation in which subjects homozygous for the Met allele have reduced enzymatic activity with consequently reduced catecholamine degradation in frontal cortex. Recent studies suggest that dopamine (DA) signaling in the frontal cortex is necessary for fear extinction learning as well as for resiliency to long-term effects of stress. This project will use a novel humanized mouse model in which the human COMT gene with either the valine or methione coding sequence is knocked-in to the mouse Comt gene locus. This mutant model allows for direct comparison of the human COMT val and met allele effects on neural functions and behavior. This unique model will be used to determine (1) the DA receptor mechanism and neural circuits underlying Met/Met abnormalities in cued fear learning and extinction and (2) the role of COMTval158met in other PTSD-like symptoms and response to treatment. To enhance translation to the clinic, we will also test whether the COMTval158met polymorphism modulates the response to extinction-based treatments in veterans with PTSD. The overall hypothesis is that the Met polymorphism confers risk for PTSD and alters treatment response to exposure therapy due to alterations in catecholamine signaling in cortex and amygdala regions. In aim 1 we use novel knockin mice for the human COMTval158met polymorphism and pharmacological tools to test the hypothesis that altered DA receptor D1, D2 and D4 signaling in the cortex and amygdala underlies the extinction deficits and increased fear retention in Met/Met mice. In aim 2 we will use the predator stress model of PTSD in COMTval158met mice to determine if the Met allele increases responsivity to enduring effects of trauma on anxiety-like behaviors. We will also determine if methylphenidate, which preferentially enhances cortical DA signaling and is clinically available, blocks the anxiety responses induced by predator stress in COMTval158met mice. In aim 3, we will determine if the COMTval158met genotype predicts treatment response in Veterans with PTSD undergoing either extinction-based or non-extinction based psychotherapy. The findings from this project will (1) advance our understanding of COMT and cortical DA system in the etiology and treatment of PTSD (2) support development of targeted treatments that normalize catecholamine signaling in the frontal cortex of Met carriers (3) determine the potential utility of methylphenidate as a novel treatment for PTSD and (4) determine if the COMTval158met genotype is predictive of treatment responses in Veterans with PTSD."

Its primary role is to initiation of shoulder movement and control of the arm position in space. Rotator cuff tears (RCT) are increasingly common in the aging population, with some studies showing that up to 20% of the population greater than 50 years of age has a symptomatic RCT. Patients will symptomatic RCT have difficulties raising their arms and many of their daily activities are impaired as a result. Our VA patients are an advanced aging population, compared to general population in U.S. With the aging of our Veteran population, RCT is becoming a more and more important health issue for the VA patients. The development of muscle fibrosis and fatty infiltration (FI) are critical factors that determine the clinical outcome of patients with tis injury. It has been demonstrated that the amount of FI in rotator cuff muscles correlate with poor clinical results. There is no effective strategies currently exist to treat this pathologic change once it occurs. Recent works from multiple groups have suggested that a population of muscle progenitor cells, named fibro-adipo progenitor cells (FAPs) are responsible for muscle fibrosis and FI after direct muscle injuries. However, the role of FAPs in rotator cuff muscle pathology has not been studied. The transforming growth factor beta (TGF?) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling pathways have been reported to play critical roles in regulating stem cell differentiation, including fibrogenesis and adipogenesis. However, their role in regulating FAPs differentiation in rotator cuff muscle fibrosis and FI remains unknown. Better understanding of the role of these pathways in rotator cuff muscle fibrosis and fatty infiltration may lead to novel pharmacological treatment to prevent or reserve muscle pathology after RCT, thus to improve the clinical outcomes for our effect Veterans."

"9298263","Project Summary  Alcohol abuse is a major risk factor in initiating pancreatitis in humans and in rodents. Experimental evidence indicates that alcohol consumption leads to the destabilization of lysosomes and increases zymogen fragility in acinar cells. Cells can adapt and protect themselves by removing these damaged lysosomes and zymogen granules (ZGs) by autophagy and lysosomal biogenesis. However, these protective mechanisms are impaired after chronic alcohol consumption. Cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) agonists have potent anti-inflammatory effects and protect against experimental pancreatitis in mice. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms by which CB2 agonists protect against pancreatitis are not known. Moreover, what is also missing is the availability of CB2 agonists with optimal pharmacokinetics and absence of major toxicity as tested in relevant alcoholic pancreatitis models. In our preliminary studies, we established a novel alcohol pancreatitis mouse model using the recently established chronic plus acute alcohol binge (Gao-binge) protocol. Gao-binge induces significant pathogenesis in mouse pancreas, including edema, increased ZGs, elevated expression of inflammatory cytokines, increased infiltration of inflammatory cells and release of pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) into the blood. We also demonstrated that Gao-binge decreases expression of pancreatic cannabinoid receptor 2 (CB2) and inactivates TFEB, a master regulator of lysosomal biogenesis. A selective CB2 agonist activates TFEB in mouse pancreas and increases autophagic flux in cultured acinar cells. Here we propose a novel hypothesis that ethanol metabolism leads to decreased CB2 expression and impaired TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis, insufficient autophagy, accumulation of fragile ZGs, damaged lysosomes, and subsequent pancreatitis. Our long-term goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms for alcohol impairment of lysosomal biogenesis in pancreatic acinar cells, in order to identify steps in the repair pathway that are points for intervention in alcoholic pancreatitis. The objective of this proposal is to understand how CB2 agonists activate TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis and selective zymophagy and lysophagy to protect against alcohol-induced pancreatitis. Using complimentary expertise in CB2 receptor pharmacology/toxicology (NIAAA intramural research program) and modeling of lysosomal biogenesis and alcoholic pancreatitis in vitro and in vivo (University of Kansas Medical Center) we propose to test a set of novel, highly selective and orally available CB2 agonists assuring quick translation toward clinical application for the treatment of alcoholic pancreatitis. We will determine how the selective CB2 agonists activate TFEB- mediated lysosomal biogenesis and their ability to improve the insufficient autophagy to remove damaged lysosomes and ZGs induced by chronic alcohol consumption. This proposal brings together research expertise that will address key research questions on alcoholic pancreatitis and the potential intervention by CB2 agonists, which would not otherwise be possible."
"9275396","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         ABSTRACT Cystinuria is an inherited human renal disease with significant morbidity affecting 1 in 7000 veterans. The disease is caused by mutation of genes involved in renal cystine transport resulting in elevated urinary cystine and kidney stone formation. Medical treatments to prevent the formation of cystine stones are not very effective and have unpleasant side effects. With the genetic basis of the disorder defined (mutation in SLC3A1, cystinuria type I), new opportunities for targeted molecular therapies exist. Transposons are non- viral plasmid-DNA based vectors that represent promising emerging tools for chromosomal transgene insertion and establishment of persistent gene expression. In order for transposon-based technologies to mediate effective and safe therapeutic gene transfer for cystinuria, kidney-targeted gene delivery must be combined with strategies able to target integration of therapeutic genes to unique chromosomal elements thereby limiting genotoxicity imparted by gene transfer. In specific aim 1, we have developed a novel hydrodynamic injection method for kidney-specific DNA delivery and have demonstrated that transposons are capable of achieving long-term gene expression using this technology. We propose to evaluate for the extent of long-term gene expression after kidney specific gene transfer, further elucidate the kidney cell types stably transfected, analyze transposon integration sites after gene transfer in vivo, and evaluate for the possibility of short- and long-term toxicity after transposon- mediated gene transfer to intact kidney. Thus far, long-term phenotypic correction of an inherited kidney disease has not been demonstrated using gene transfer. Mutation of a dibasic amino acid transporter encoded by SLC3A1 is the most frequent cause of cystinuria. In specific aim 2, we propose to use transposon-mediated kidney-specific gene transfer to phenotypically correct cystinuria in SLC3A1 -/- mice. We have recently demonstrated the ability to manipulate chromosomal integration site selection of the piggyBac transposon system by fusing a highly site-specific zinc finger protein (ZFP) to the piggyBac transposase, thereby directing integration into user-selected chromosomal elements. In specific aim 3, we propose an innovative method of selecting for site-directed events and will deliver SLC3A1 in a site-directed manner into cultured proximal tubular kidney cells. In additon, we propose to develop an animal model for evaluating for site-directed integration in vivo. These studies are intended to demonstrate the capability of transposon-mediated gene transfer for potential treatment renal syndromes in veterans."
"9256383","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the proposed project is to examine the predictive role of working memory (WM) networks in reduced alcohol consumption, among a group of HIV positive heavy drinkers, receiving a Motivational Interviewing (MI) intervention. Hazardous alcohol use (HAU) is common in people living with HIV (PLWH) with estimates of HAU between 5-33% in this population (4-7). There are many deleterious consequences of hazardous alcohol use in this population, which include increased risk of: HIV transmission, exacerbation of comorbid medical conditions, comorbid psychiatric diagnoses, and other psychosocial consequences. In order to effectively intervene upon alcohol use, it is important to understand the mechanisms by which cognitive abilities impact intervention effectiveness. Previous studies have suggested that WM abilities, prior to behavioral intervention, are associated with intervention outcome (11-12). The basic role of WM has been defined as a form of memory that supports the temporary storage and maintenance of internal representations and mediates the controlled manipulation of these representations (13-14). A critical component of WM is the phonological loop which supports the process of storing speech based information, so that it can be manipulated (13). A critical element of MI, which involves the use of phonological loop resources, is the element of client change talk. Client change talk is among the most consistent predictors of intervention success because verbalizing change talk can help to resolve ambivalence, which can help move the individual toward a greater likelihood of behavior change (15-16). MI is one of the most effective behavioral treatments for problems with alcohol. However, no studies have directly investigated the predictive role of WM networks, as predictors of drinking reduction following MI. We aim to examine WM networks using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response during n-back (0-back and 2-back) tasks, resting state functional connectivity analyses, as well as WM abilities using cognitive measures, to evaluate whether baseline WM abilities are predictive of alcohol reduction, in response to MI intervention. We will test whether decreased fMRI BOLD activation in WM regions of interest (ROI) during n-back performance predict alcohol reduction among individuals receiving MI intervention. We will also evaluate whether higher baseline neurocognitive WM abilities (N-back performance, Letter Number Sequencing, Trails, Stroop) predict greater alcohol reduction in response to MI. Finally, we will determine if higher baseline Total Independence levels (i.e., functional connectivity) between WM ROIs predict reduced alcohol consumption at 6 months, among individuals receiving MI. Findings from this research will contribute to an understanding of mechanisms associated with successful response to behavioral intervention. Furthermore, understanding changes in the underlying neural networks associated with positive response to MI, may inform future interventions, which may focus on enhancing WM abilities, prior to behavioral alcohol reduction intervention."
"9205173","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):           This application is a competitive renewal for 4 years of funding which extends earlier work conducted during the previous grant period. In this application we will enhance our understanding of the neurobiology of white matter changes in schizophrenia by introducing novel tools and methods that are more specific with respect to underlying pathology. This work is highly relevant to the overall VA mission, as patients with schizophrenia utilize 40% of the VA healthcare resources. Historically, the role of white matter in schizophrenia has been largely overlooked, with the majority of biological hypotheses focused on abnormalities in gray matter. This is despite the fact that schizophrenia is now viewed as a dys-connection syndrome, and that it is white matter that provides long-range communication among neurons. Only recently, with the introduction of diffusion MRI (dMRI), has attention slowly shifted to investigating the roe of white matter in schizophrenia. Nonetheless, findings to date have not led to an understanding of the etiology or to new pharmacological treatment(s), primarily because dMRI measures are nonspecific to underlying microstructural pathology. New methods, however, are more specific with respect to pathology, and based on our preliminary data using free-water derived from dMRI, and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we hypothesize that white matter in schizophrenia is compromised by at least two distinct pathological processes that occur at different stages of the disease, i.e., neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Here we will use novel tools and methods to identify the neurobiological nature, time course, and functional consequences of specific changes in white matter in schizophrenia. Specifically, we will use several recently developed MRI acquisition and analysis methods, and apply them to both early onset schizophrenia and chronic schizophrenia populations, as well as to matched healthy controls. In terms of biological hypotheses, we predict that: A) early onset schizophrenia is likel associated with pathology (neuroinflammation) affecting extracellular volume observed using dMRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy indicators of neuroinflammation; B) chronic schizophrenia is likely associated with increasing cellular pathology (neurodegeneration), observed using dMRI and MRS measures; and, C) both neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration have an effect on axonal conduction transmission speed, evinced using an interhemispheric transfer task, and localization of these changes will predict clinical profile. Longitudinal changes will also be evaluated one year later in the early psychosis patients in order to determine progressive changes in white matter over this time period. The investigation of dMRI, MRS, and EEG methods in schizophrenia will lead to novel findings of white matter abnormalities in schizophrenia, including new information about the role of neuroinflammation and neurodegenerative processes that occur at different stages of the disorder, which, in turn, will provide a new perspective on possible treatment interventions that will likely involve anti-inflammatory agents early in the course of illness."

"9339474","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Differences in health outcomes and longevity across similarly developed countries are long-standing puzzles in public health. Studying these differences and identifying their causes and consequences is crucial for determining what reforms or changes may have the highest potential to improve health outcomes in the US and abroad. In this project we ask whether international differences in costs that individuals face for prescription pharmaceuticals is a quantitatively important channel contributing to the disparities in health outcomes and longevity that have been documented between the US and other OECD countries. We focus on a comparison between the US and Sweden. Our project takes advantage of a series of natural experiments in the Swedish social insurance system, coupled with administrative data of unmatched quality, to explore the empirical link between prescription drug coverage and outcomes for several groups of common chronic conditions. First, using regression discontinuity designs that rely on discrete changes in coverage of some prescription drugs and non-linear insurance contract schedules, we estimate how changes in out of pocket costs for certain prescription drugs affect the health outcomes of conditions that they treat. Importantly, we will estimate both local average effects and heterogeneity in the link between out of pocket costs and health outcomes along the socio-economic gradient. We will then use US and Swedish administrative insurance claims data to document differences in out of pocket costs of pharmaceuticals for a select set of conditions. With these estimates in hand, we will conduct an exploratory decomposition analysis of whether differences in out of pocket costs of drugs may be an important channel accounting for differences in health outcomes between the US and Sweden. This project will advance our understanding of the role of health insurance system design for international variations in disease prevalence and mortality - this role has important policy implications, but has so far been underexplored."
"9297719","PROJECT SUMMARY  Alcohol use puts adolescents with suicide-related thoughts and behaviors at high risk for attempted suicide and suicide death. Typically, adolescents who make a suicide plan or attempt are admitted to an inpatient psychiatric hospital for a brief time period in order to be evaluated. These inpatient units rarely address alcohol use in a comprehensive fashion as the adolescent's suicide risk is the primary focus of treatment. Given the significant role alcohol can play in subsequent suicidal ideation and attempts, greater attention to the assessment and initial treatment of alcohol use in adolescent inpatient psychiatric settings is essential, with a post-discharge follow-up plan playing a critical role in the safety of the suicidal adolescent.  The proposed study will develop and test iASIST (integrated Alcohol and Suicide Intervention for Suicidal Teens), a novel adjunctive intervention for alcohol use and alcohol-related suicidal thoughts and behaviors. iASIST involves three components: 1) one 60-90 minute individual intervention with the adolescent in which motivational enhancement techniques are used to explore alcohol use as a risk factor for continued suicide-related thoughts and behaviors, build the adolescent's motivation to reduce or stop their alcohol use, and create a change plan if the adolescent is ready, 2) a subsequent 30 minute family intervention in which the interventionist facilitates a discussion between the adolescent and the parent about the change plan using motivational enhancement techniques to align the parent with the adolescent to strengthen the adolescent's self-efficacy and commitment to the change plan as well as the parent's confidence and ability related to supporting the adolescent in the change plan, and 3) a post-discharge mHealth booster to adolescents focused on strengthening their commitment to the change plan, and to parents focused on their commitment, confidence, and ability related to supporting the adolescent in the change plan.  First, we will refine the design of the mHealth booster by obtaining feedback on proposed content, interface, and functionality via in-depth interviews with 8 adolescents and 8 parents who completed the intervention arm of PI O'Brien's current pilot trial of the in-person component of iASIST. Second, we will conduct an open trial of iASIST with 10 adolescents and their parents to test the full adaptation of iASIST (i.e., in-person sessions and mHealth booster) and make subsequent changes for the final study phase. Third, we will conduct a randomized trial with 50 adolescents and their parents to test the feasibility and acceptability of iASIST as well as alcohol- and suicide-related outcomes at 3 months post-discharge. Intervention participants will be compared to adolescents and their parents who will receive an attention-matched comparison condition focused on the role of a healthy lifestyle in mental health that includes a post-discharge mHealth control targeting the maintenance of a healthy lifestyle. The data from this project will inform the preparation of a fully powered, future trial of the intervention."
"9223549","PROJECT SUMMARY Episodic memory decline is a hallmark feature of Alzheimer's Disease. Yet notable declines in memory are also prevalent in the majority of our aging population, which does not meet criteria for dementia. Understanding how memory dysfunction in these non-demented, healthy older adults differs from individuals with (or at risk for) dementia will require further investigation of the neurobiological substrates that contribute to memory in aging, which is the focus of this proposal. Here, we aim to characterize age-related differences in hippocampal white and gray matter microstructure using high-resolution, multi-compartment diffusion imaging. Traditional, single-compartment diffusion imaging studies have predominantly revealed age-related decreases in white matter microstructure, with large age effects in tracts that project to the hippocampus (fornix, perforant path). It remains unclear, however, whether this selective vulnerability of hippocampal white matter to aging can be attributed to distinct neurobiological substrates (axonal degeneration, demyelination). Moreover, single- compartment diffusion imaging is not commonly used to study gray matter because it is not sensitive to neurite (axon, dendrite) structure within this tissue. However, gray matter in the hippocampus exhibits highly organized neurite structure that is suitable for interrogation with multi-compartment diffusion imaging. Relative to single- compartment approaches, multi-compartment diffusion imaging provides more accurate indices of neurite microstructure. Using a high-resolution version of this novel imaging approach, we propose to test whether age differences in hippocampal white (Specific Aim 1) and gray (Specific Aim 1) matter can be attributed to distinct neurobiological substrates that vary by tissue type (axonal degeneration, dendritic de-arborization). We further aim to test whether these more accurate markers of hippocampal aging account for age-related declines in mnemonic processes that rely on the hippocampus (Specific Aim 3). Taken together, this proposal is an important step toward our long-term goal of clarifying the neural substrates being measured using human diffusion imaging by directly relating in vivo and ex vivo assessments of these substrates within the same aged individuals. The proposed study also has the potential to identify a neuroimaging marker that dissociates memory dysfunction in healthy aging versus dementia."
"9307803","Abstract Resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) provides reproducible, task-independent biomarkers of coherent functional activity linking different brain regions. The main goal of the proposed project is to leverage advances in signal processing and machine learning methods to derive clinically useful biomarkers based on patterns of functional connectivity, and to test these biomarkers in a large study of brain development. Central to our methodology are 1) computing a subject-specific functional parcellation of the brain, which defines nodes for characterizing individualized functional brain networks; 2) extracting sparse connectivity patterns for robustly representing brain networks; 3) capturing heterogeneity in brain networks across individuals in a given population; and 4) deriving individualized predictive indices of psychosis risk from brain connectivity in a large study of brain development. This novel suite of functional connectivity analysis tools will be developed and validated based on data from the Human Connectome Project and the Philadelphia Neurodevelopmental Cohort (PNC). Finally, these techniques will be applied to PNC data in order to delineate heterogeneity in network development in youth with psychosis-spectrum symptoms. Our hypothesis is that patterns of functional connectivity in adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will be different from those in typically developing adolescents, and this difference will display a high degree of heterogeneity that is linked to underlying heterogeneity in pathologic neurodevelopmental trajectories. Moreover, we expect that machine learning techniques will allow us to predict on an individual basis which adolescents with psychosis-spectrum symptoms will remain stable, which will revert to normal, and which will progress to psychosis, based on their baseline functional connectivity signatures. Our methods are generally applicable to rsfMRI studies for detecting and quantifying spatio-temporal functional connectivity patterns in diverse fields, including diagnosing brain abnormalities in neuropsychiatric diseases, and finding associations of functional connectivity with different cognitive functions. All methods will be made publicly available and form an important new resource for the broader neuroscience community."
"9345955","Project Summary/Abstract This project is aimed at developing a new type of optical nano-probes for targeted molecular imaging of tumors. Specifically, these nano-probes are hybrid structures composed of an erythrocyte-derived membrane shell that encapsulates indocyanine green (ICG), the only FDA-approved near infrared (NIR) chromophore. We refer to these nano-probes as NIR erythrocyte-derived transducers (NETs). Our long-term goal is to commercialize the NETs as fluorescent probes for intraoperative imaging, or in conjunction with endoscopic procedures to aid visualization of tumor margins and small tumor nodules (< 0.5 mm diameter) that cannot otherwise be detected by current imaging techniques. New imaging methods that can identify tumor margins, and small tumor nodules when they are still at an early stage or localized, will have tremendous clinical impact by enabling image-guided identification for resection of all tumors to reduce or eliminate cancer recurrence and ultimately improve treatment success and patient survival. Such capabilities are not currently available, and if achieved, will impact the clinical management of patients with various types of solid cancers to reduce the burden of cancer and the deaths resulting from it. There are no prior reports of such constructs for optical imaging of tumors. Therefore, this proposal presents a highly innovative technology in tumor imaging, and the first step in investigating the potential of these materials for future clinical translation during intraoperative or endoscopic procedures to aid identification of tumor margins and small tumor nodules. Our specific aims (SAs) during this Phase I project are to: (1) optimize the formulation of NETs to maximal their fluorescence emission (SA1); (2) functionalize the NETs with Herceptin®, an FDA-approved monoclonal antibody, for recognition of cancer cells by targeting the HER2 receptor (SA2), a key biomarker whose over-expression is associated with carcinogenesis of various solid tumors such as breast, ovarian, non-small cell lung cancer, and colorectal cancers; and (3) demonstrate the feasibility of using the functionalized NETs as nano-probes for targeted imaging of tumors in a mouse model (SA3). Upon completion of the proposed Phase I studies, we will have identified the optimum formulation of NETs with maximal fluorescence emission, and demonstrated feasibility for targeted imaging of tumors. Our activities during Phase II will include characterizing the biodistribution of NETs to determine the dynamics of the imaging sensitivity, and development of fabrication standardization procedures and full commercialization plans. Key commercial applications are: (1) intraoperative assessment of disseminated cancer; (2) minimally invasive or endoscopic assessment; and (3) small animal imaging applications. The business model for the commercialization of the proposed optical nano-probes hinges on established and validated business models associated with contrast agents or established molecular tags, which represent low risk models for the commercialization of NETs as products. This Phase I application is the first step towards these endeavors."

"9272331","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this Program Project Grant, entitled Cell Autonomous and Non-autonomous Mechanisms of Aging is to examine the mechanisms by which spontaneous, stochastic damage drives aging. This Program seeks to challenge the current notion that stochastic cellular damage, in particular, DNA damage promotes aging through a predominantly cell-autonomous mechanism by triggering programmed cell death or senescence. Although it is well-established that in response to high doses of genotoxic stress cells can secrete senescence-associated factors, which have a paracrine effect on neighboring cells, no one has established that non-cell autonomous events drive aging in response to physiological levels of endogenous DNA damage in vivo. The proposed experiments will address a model of aging where age-dependent accumulation of stochastic damage, including DNA damage, drives aging through both cell autonomous and non-autonomous pathways. This Program Project is comprised of three highly integrated projects. Project 1 (Laura Niedernhofer) will examine the cell autonomous and non-autonomous effects of DNA damage, measuring oxidative DNA damage, cellular senescence, ROS levels and aging-related pathology. Project 2 (Paul Robbins) will examine the cell autonomous and non-autonomous roles of NF-KB, a transcription factor activated in response to cellular damage and stress, in driving senescence, ROS and oxidative DNA damage with aging. Finally, Project 3 (Johnny Huard) will analyze the cell autonomous and non-autonomous pathways involved in age-related loss of stem cell function, as well as identify the factors secreted by functional adult stem cells that extend lifespan and healthspan. All projects will use tissues and cells from naturally aged mice and mouse models of accelerated aging, including mice in which ERCC1 is deleted tissue-specifically to affect the rate of DNA damage one tissue at a time. The projects will be supported by four cores, A) Administrative (Paul Robbins); B) Mouse Models (Laura Niedernhofer); C) Imaging (Simon Watkins) and D) Proteomics (Nathan Yates)."
"9327712","Project Summary/Abstract Multimodular polyketide synthases (PKSs) catalyze the biosynthesis of many structurally and pharmacologically diverse antibiotics via an assembly line mechanism. Recently, genomic sequencing has revealed large numbers ? far surpassing known PKS biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) ? of cryptic or ?orphan? PKS BGCs associated with no known polyketide products. Therefore, the analysis of orphan PKSs should reveal intriguing novel biosynthetic strategies and new structures with new therapeutic properties as well as reveal paths to pathogenicity in microorganisms. In particular, the NOCAP (NOCardiosis-Associated Polyketide) synthase is an orphan PKS expressed in nine clinical strains of the Nocardia isolated from nocardiosis-affected patients. The NOCAP synthase has been partially reconstituted in vitro. However, because the remainder of the BGC encoding NOCAP and its set of tailoring enzymes was not reconstituted, this approach precludes identification and elucidation of the natural product(s). This proposed research training plan seeks to understand the biosynthetic repertoire of the NOCAP synthase, and also seeks to understand its role in the pathogenicity of Nocardia. Accordingly, the plan is divided into three specific aims: 1) direct cloning, refactoring and heterologous expression of the complete NOCAP BGC in the model expression host Streptomyces coelicolor for the efficient production, discovery and characterization of this synthase?s natural product(s), 2) deletion analysis of the tailoring enzymes accompanying the NOCAP synthase and characterization of their biosynthesis and transfer of different deoxysugars onto the aglycone, and 3) using co-cultures of wild-type and mutant Nocardia and human lung cell lines, investigation of how the NOCAP BGC natural product(s) provides a selective advantage during Nocardia infections. The recent surge in genomic sequencing has exposed many orphan PKSs and may provide a vast resource for pharmaceutical and agrochemical natural products research. Thus, this proposed research training plan represents an important next step: analysis of orphan PKSs and their roles in organism fitness. The results of the proposed study will contribute important tools and strategies for discovering and rationally engineering not only novel polyketides but also products derived from NRPSs. Further, the proposed plan will elucidate how these remarkable enzymes contributes to the biological fitness of microorganisms.  "
"9265754","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)    Dementia is a contributing cause for 1 in 3 deaths, and is the only major cause of death with no effective prevention or treatment. One million Americans have advanced dementia, characterized by inability to recognize family, sparse speech, and dependency for all activities of daily living. Median survival is 1.3 years, and 6-month mortality is 25%. The final year of life wih dementia is characterized by hospitalizations for acute complications -- pneumonia and other infections, dehydration, malnutrition, falls and fractures. Acute illnesses cause symptom distress for patients, with emotional and financial strain for family caregivers. These illnesses are also associated with a high risk of death in the next year and raise ethical questions about goals of medical treatment. Palliative care consultation improves outcomes for patients with advanced cancer and critical illness, but has never been rigorously tested for advanced dementia. Dementia-specific palliative care is needed to address the unique symptoms and treatment decisions relevant to this disease. We therefore propose to develop and pilot test a model of palliative care consultation for advanced dementia patients, triggered by hospitalization for a serious acute illness. Patients will be enrolled with their family decision-makers (N=60 dyads) in a randomized feasibility trial. Intervention dyads will receive specialty palliative care consultaton during hospital admission, plus post-discharge collaborative care by their outpatient primary care provider and a palliative care nurse practitioner. Control dyads will receive usual care. Our research objective is to generate preliminary data for a large multi-site randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a model of collaborative palliative care for advanced dementia in an application to NIA (PA-13-354 Advancing the Science of Geriatric Palliative Care). Our specific aims for this application are: Aim 1: To develop a best-practice model of collaborative palliative care for advanced dementia triggered by hospital admission for serious acute illness. Aim 2: To conduct a pilot randomized trial of collaborative palliative care for advanced dementia (versus usual care) to demonstrate the feasibility of conducting a larger RCT and to estimate effect sizes to inform the larger RCT. The primary outcome will be number of hospital transfers (emergency room or hospital admission) in the 30 days post discharge. Secondary outcomes, measured at hospital discharge and 30 days follow-up, will include number of palliative care domains in the care plan, hospice referral, POLST (Physician Orders for Life- Sustaining Treatment) form completion, decision not to re-hospitalize, and burdensome treatments."
"9350520","Overall abstract Our Cancer Systems Biology Center of HoPE (Heterogeneity of Phenotypic Evolution) will develop a suite of systems-based methodologies to understand how genomic diversity, clonal evolution, and phenotypic change  . To evaluate their potential for translation, we will integrate these dynamic models with clinical trials that will evaluate whether these phenotypic changes can be targeted for therapy. We hypothesize that acquired resistance emerges from selection acting on phenotypes during tumor evolution, and that simultaneously measuring and modeling subclone genotypes and phenotypes will identify new, and testable, therapeutic targets. Selective pressures from therapy and the tumor microenvironment can propel subclones from every patient's tumor along an evolutionary trajectory that leads to resistance. Indeed, our data shows that both genetic and phenotypic diversity among tumor subclones evolves as cancer cells progress to a resistant state. However, it is not yet known the specific phenotypes that promote that resistant state, the interactions among them, and how they converge to common resistant phenotypes seen in late stage cancer. To address these and other questions, we will develop a new class of dynamical systems models of subclone evolution to characterize the changes and development of key cell states that arise during acquired chemo-resistance and metastasis using our unique patient cohorts. These mechanistic models will identify points of therapeutic vulnerability that we will test in clinical trials aimed at blocking evolution to a resistant state by targeting critical resistant phenotypes. Our Center is comprised of an Administrative, Education/Outreach, Translational, and Computational Cores, in addition to two complementary projects. The synergies are derived from: 1) the convergent parameterization of the evolutionary models drawn from deep longitudinal patient progression studies (Project 1) and broad multisite metastatic tumor analyses (Project 2), resulting in a robust model to identify resistant states for clinical targeting; and 2) an integrated computational and experimental framework and resources for dissecting tumor heterogeneity and evolution that will contribute to an improved capacity for personalized cancer therapy. Our multidisciplinary team of systems biologists, bioinformaticians, tumor biologists, pharmacologists, mathematical biologists, and clinicians will tackle these scientific challenges. We will create programs to educate the next generation of scientists in systems biology and inform the community about the latest scientific advances and their impact on treatment strategies. And we will provide state of the art tools for the analysis of patient samples and tumor genomic complexity. These studies move beyond prior research by integrating cell population dynamics and cellular phenotypes with cellular genotypes, and will deliver approaches and a knowledge base to block or reverse the transition to a resistant state for advanced stage cancer patients. interact in the progression toward chemoresistant breast and ovarian cancer"
"9275410","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):         Coronary heart disease is a major cause of mortality in the US and in our Veterans. Biological approaches to treat the diseased heart using cell delivery have shown only modest therapeutic benefit, in part due to poor cell survival and ineffective electromechanical coupling to the host myocardium. Our previous research demonstrates that delivery of therapeutic cells cultured in an extracellular matrix (ECM) can improve the survival and functionality of the transplanted cells, owing to the structural support of the ECM as a scaffold and the signaling cues they impart to the cells. In particular, we have previously demonstrated the potency of anisotropic nanofibrillar scaffolds in guiding cellular alignment along the direction of the nanofibrils, enhancing cell survival in ischemic tissues, and imparting signaling cues that confer cell function consistent with a non- diseased state. Anisotropic scaffolds may be well-suited for engineering cardiac tissue which also has highly organized cellular structure. In addition, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may be a candidate cell source for the generation of autologous therapeutic cardiovascular cells. The long-term objectives of this research are to engineer a three-dimensional vascularized cardiac patch with pre-formed physiological cellular organization to repair ischemic heart disease; and to investigate the basic biological mechanisms underlying ECM-mediated cell-cell interactions that enhance cardioprotection under conditions of ischemia. We hypothesize that a three- dimensionally aligned iPSC-derived cardiac patch with endothelial interactions will provide more functional and viable engineered tissues for repair of myocardial infarction, due to more effective electrical coupling and organized tissue morphology, as well as the activation of cardioprotective nitric oxide signaling imparted by ECM nanopatterning. Accordingly, our specific aims are: 1) To engineer a vascularized aligned iPSC-derived cardiomyocyte (CM) patch and elucidating the molecular mechanisms of ECM-mediated nitric oxide signaling in enhancing iPSC-CM survival and phenotype. The iPSC-derived CMs (iPSC- CMs) and iPSC-derived endothelial cells (iPSC-ECs) will be co-cultured on three-dimensional oriented nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds with culture conditions optimized to promote iPSC-CM cell survival and function within the patch, when compared to patches that lack oriented nanopatterning or vascular interactions. The role of ECM-mediated nitric oxide signaling in enhancing iPSC-CM survival and phenotype will be investigated in the context of gain- and loss-of-function assays. 2) To determine the therapeutic effect of a vascularized aligned iPSC-CM patch for treatment of myocardial infarction. The vascularized oriented cardiac patch will be transplanted onto the epicardium of rats after myocardial infarction. The animals will be monitored over time for functional improvement in cardiac function, wall thickness, and electromechanical coupling. The role of nitric oxide in mediating the functional effects of the aligned vascularized cardiac patch will be quantified by measuring production of nitric oxide and related signaling molecules. The knowledge gained from these studies will provide a stronger foundation of basic knowledge and improved methods for clinical development of engineered cardiac patches, ultimately with the goal of restoring myocardial function to the diseased hearts of our Veterans."
"9261436","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Group A Streptococcus (S. pyogenes or GAS) is a major public health threat in the United States and globally. It is the cause of streptococcal pharyngitis (strep throat), infections of the skin and soft tissues, and less common but potentiall fatal syndromes such as necrotizing fasciitis and streptococcal toxic shock as well as the post-infectious complications of glomerulonephritis and acute rheumatic fever, which together account for an estimated 500,000 deaths annually. The absence of a vaccine and ongoing morbidity and mortality despite treatment highlight the need for alternative approaches. An attractive novel target is a bacterial regulatory system that controls virulence. The CsrRS (or CovRS) two-component system regulates expression of 10 to 15% of the GAS genome including multiple virulence factors. During the previous funding period, we identified the human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 as a potent signal that acts through CsrRS to upregulate virulence factor expression. We propose that CsrRS acts as a sensor of host innate immunity by detecting subinhibitory concentrations of LL-37 and, in response, induces expression of antiphagocytic factors that promote invasive GAS infection. To enable the design of strategies that exploit CsrRS signaling to block virulence gene expression, fundamental questions must be answered: How is LL-37 signaling transduced to regulate target gene expression? How does the CsrR function as an activator of certain genes and a repressor of others? Why are CsrRS signal transduction mutations over-represented in invasive clinical isolates? The Aims of the research are (1) to characterize the effects of LL-37 signaling, CsrS-mediated signal transduction, and CsrR transcriptional regulation on GAS global gene expression; (2) to determine the molecular basis of CsrRS-mediated activation or repression of target gene expression; and (3) to investigate the selection bias for CsrRS-signaling mutants in invasive GAS infections. Achieving these Aims will shed new light on the molecular basis of signaling and gene regulation by CsrRS and other bacterial regulatory systems and will enable novel future strategies for prevention and treatment of infections due to GAS and other bacterial pathogens."

This is a collaborative venture between scientists and clinicians at the University of Washington, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle Children's Hospital and The University of Rochester. Project 1 focuses on adapting methods for AAV-mediated gene transfer to large animal models for DMD by focusing on expression cassette design, AAV serotypes, physical delivery methods and scale-up to test the hypothesis that AAV vectors expressing microdystrophin can be used to treat all the major muscle groups involved in DMD. In parallel, we will adapt AAV systems for targeting the dominant disorder FSHD by delivering RNAi cassettes to cell lines and mouse models followed by safety testing in dogs. Thus, we are performing preclinical studies to develop clinical trials for dominant and recessively inherited dystrophies by modeling DMD and FSHD. This latter work provides a link to project 2, which will leverage the collaborative research programs on FSHD in Seattle and Rochester for studies of advanced biomarker assessments of disease, and to explore immune mediated events in FSHD. The clinical infrastructure to be developed in Project 2 will lay a foundation for future clinical trials of gen therapy for DMD, FSHD and other MDs at the University of Washington. These studies will be supported by three Cores. An Administrative Core to facilitate communication and coordination between the components of the Center and for overseeing data management and distribution. A Scientific Research Resource Core to provide stocks of AAV and lentiviral vectors to members of the Center and to muscular dystrophy researchers worldwide. This Core will also provide training, consulting and reagents related to muscular dystrophy research and gene transfer. Lastly, an Investigator Development and Patient Outreach Core (IDPO) for a mentored research program in basic and clinical research, and ethics that will prepare new investigators to address the critical needs of individuals with dystrophy. The IDPO will also provide outreach programs to the public and patient communities."
"9182878","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  It is estimated that cancer prevention efforts have the potential to reduce cancer incidence and cancer- related mortality by over 50% and 30% percent, respectively. Although many avoidable exposures are etiologically related to cancer, effective interventions have proven difficult to implement globally. Screening continues to be based primarily on clinical examination followed by histologic assessment of biopsies, perhaps followed by removal of preneoplastic lesions when they exist. However, unlike for advanced disease, effective molecularly-driven interventions and risk assessment are not available for clinically normal tissues that may be have been exposed to carcinogens or for preneoplastic lesions. This is because we have not identified the key genomic drivers of progression from normal tissue to preneoplastic lesion to invasive cancer. The long-term goal of this project is use  knowledge of key genomic changes that drive early cancer progression to identify and validate novel molecular targets for chemoprevention and risk assessment so that cancer incidences may be decreased.  Squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) arising in various organ sites cause over 900,000 deaths worldwide annually. Because stratified squamous epithelia form environmental barriers in the airways, gastrointestinal / genitourinary tracts, and skin, the majority are drivenby carcinogenic exposures such as tobacco and solar radiation. Importantly, previous results and our own data show that SCCs from diverse sites share deep molecular commonalities including alterations in global gene expression and in TP53, TP63, NOTCH, and SOX2 signaling. Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cuSCC) has the most accessible and clinically well-characterized progression sequence of any human cancer, from a distinct precancerous lesion, the actinic keratosis (AK), to invasive carcinoma. Therefore, it is an ideal model for establishing  a paradigm of molecularly targeted cancer chemoprevention for SCC.  Our central hypothesis is that specific microRNA-mRNA functional pairs are effective chemoprevention targets because they are key drivers of cuSCC development. Our preliminary data strongly support the validity of testing it, and the identification of the genomic drivers of cuSCC progression would dramatically impact the prognosis and treatment of this disease and potentially that of all SCC. To test this hypothesis, we have used next generation sequencing to bear on a clinic-pathologically well-defined development sequence that is both accessible and common. Our proposal contains significant innovation in its use of (1) matched isogenic normal skin, AK, and cuSCC from patients to minimize inter-individual variability, (2) a well-characterized UV-driven cuSCC mouse model for comparative and functional analysis, (3) integrated cross-species genomic analysis, and (4) a novel chitosan-hydrogel RNA delivery technology for skin. Our team includes expertise in dermatology, dermatopathology, mouse cancer models, miRNA biology, and bioinformatics."
"9267556","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We propose to establish the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) HIV Research Training Program in Mozambique (Pitt HRTP). The purpose of the program is to build research capacity at the Catholic University of Mozambique, located in the port city of Beira, for the conduct of HIV clinical trials. This program is an extension of the Pitt AIDS International Training and Research Program (AITRP), which was established in 1998 and has been building research capacity at UCM since 2009. Previously, the Pitt AITRP contributed substantially to building research capacity in Brazil for the development of HIV Vaccine Trials Network (HVTN) sites in Rio de Janeiro and Sjo Paulo. The Pitt HRTP will be directed by Dr. Lee Harrison, Professor of Epidemiology and Medicine, who was also the Director of the Pitt AITRP. A broad array of non- degree and degree training opportunities will be available in epidemiology and biostatistics, laboratory sciences, behavioral sciences, and other fields relevant to clinical trials. Participating training sites are Pitt; the Federal University of Rio d Janeiro (UFRJ), Brazil; the University of Stellenbosch (SU), Cape Town, South Africa; and the Manhija Health Research Center (CISM), Manhija, Mozambique. The program includes a multidisciplinary group of experienced mentors and excellent training opportunities at each site. The inclusion of UFRJ, SU, and CISM provides substantial opportunities for south-to-south training. Trainees will have access to all of the relevant resources of the participating institutions. A key measure of program success will be the participation of UCM in HIV clinical trials by the end of the five-year funding period."
