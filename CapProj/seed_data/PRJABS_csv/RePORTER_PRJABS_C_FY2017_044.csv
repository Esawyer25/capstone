"9306083","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Mammalian cells have multiple mechanisms for regulating chromatin structure and dynamics. These mechanisms include enzymatic modification of nucleosomes, core histone variants, tethering of chromosomal sites via chromatin modifying enzymes, chromatin remodelers, chromatin architectural proteins (CAPs), and a panoply of RNAs. Abnormalities of nucleome architecture have been implicated in diseases including Down's Syndrome, metabolic diseases, neurological disorders such as Rett syndrome, and cancers of the breast, lung, and brain.  Unfortunately, it has proven difficult to relate local biochemical modifications within the chromatin to the broader organization, dynamics, and function of the nucleome. The difficulty of making these connections reflects the complexity of the underlying biology and several critical gaps in our measurement capabilities. The nucleome research community currently has (1) tools with whole-genome coverage but with limited cell-to-cell and temporal resolution and (2) tools with high spatial and temporal resolutio but with limited coverage, short measurement duration, and poor performance in the `thick' cells that constitute most of the cell types in the human body.  We are a team of investigators from the areas of super-localization microscopy, optical labels, stem cell and cancer biology, and chromatin theory. Together, we have developed a pair of connected technologies for 4D nucleomics. We propose to now take the next step, and refine and stringently test:  (1) a new class of genetically encoded and effectively unbleachable fiducials for multiplexed labeling of  chromatin components, and  (2) a 4D super-localization microscope for simultaneously tracking many targets within `thick' (~10  micron diameter) nuclei. With the labels, the imaging of single molecules within living nuclei is no longer temporally limited by photo bleaching, a new capability in light microscopy. The hardware is designed for simultaneous 4D super- localization tracking of many loci in cell types such as human stem cells, a key hardware capability for nucleome biology. To facilitate the spread of the tools into the broader biological community, we will test our tools in two systems, (1) the role of the USP16 deubiquitinase enzyme in human Down's Syndrome and (2) alterations of loci dynamics in the presence of the SATB1 DNA `loopscape controller'. When combined and validated as a unit, the tools are designed to allow measurement of the nucleome's architecture and dynamics during major cellular transitions such as division, differentiation, and senescence."
"9313961","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease in the United States and affects over one million Americans; this number is growing due to population aging. Current treatments do not prevent the disease progression that ultimately results in severe disability. There is thus a compelling need to develop neuroprotective treatments. Because at the time of the clinical diagnosis of PD there is already substantial neuronal loss, such treatments should ideally be initiated earlier. Aims of the proposed investigation are to implement and validate a novel metabolomic approach for the identification of early changes in peripheral blood of individuals with preclinical or premotor PD. The metabolomic results will be integrated with detailed and validated information on risk factors for PD, which has been collected prospectively and periodically updated. We expect by this means to identify new clues to the etiology of PD and to identify a metabolomic signature of PD that could contribute to an early diagnosis. To achieve these goals, we will take advantage of data and blood samples collected from over 80,000 participants in three large ongoing cohorts, the Nurses' Health Study (NHS), the Health Professional Follow-up Study (HPFS), and the Cancer Prevention Study-II Nutrition, who have been followed for over 25 years for incident Parkinson disease. We expect to include a total of 805 incident cases of PD that will be matched to 805 controls, using a nested case-control design."
"9311297","PROJECT SUMMARY - VDDRC CELL IMAGING CORE We are fortunate at Vanderbilt to have one of the leading facilities for microscopic imaging of digestive disease-related processes. Thus, the Vanderbilt Digestive Disease Research Center (VDDRC) will continue to support the VDDRC Cell Imaging Core, operated by the Cell Imaging Shared Resource (CISR), and ensure that VDDRC-affiliated investigators will have full access to state-of-the-art imaging equipment and expert technical support to conduct sophisticated microscopy and analysis of tissue and cellular anatomy and physiology. By utilizing a large, well-established facility, the VDDRC Cell Imaging Core provides high levels of quality control, a dedicated, expert staff and a significant economy of scale for services that would be difficult (if not impossible) for individual investigators to establish and support. This organizational structure fits well with the centralized approach to prevent needless duplication of scientific resources within federally funded research centers, enabling focused development of technology that serves all Vanderbilt research, including VDDRC investigators. The overall goal of the VDDRC Cell Imaging Core is to provide the full range of modern microscopy and digital imaging capabilities and techniques to enable and accelerate digestive disease research at Vanderbilt through three objectives: 1) acquire and maintain state-of-the art optical and EM imaging technology; 2) train, assist, and encourage V D D R C -affiliated investigators to incorporate optical, EM, and in vivo imaging technologies into their research; and 3) develop new imaging technologies that will be useful for digestive disease research. Without VDDRC support, the breadth and quality of advanced microscopy service would be weakened, thus thinning resources available to advance digestive disease research. The VDDRC support grant also reduces the net cost of imaging service to VDDRC investigators and has helped provide financial stability essential to sustain historically high levels of service to VDDRC researchers. This stability has been vital to the successful acquisition of new instruments and services that support VDDRC researchers. During the past 5 years, investigators representing 71 separate VDDRC- affiliated laboratories have used all aspects of the CISR. Over the same period, the CISR initiatives taken to obtain equipment grants, combined with institutional contributions, have provided $4,766,063 in new capital equipment, managed by the CISR, for the benefit of VDDRC investigators. This includes super-resolution, 2- photon-excited fluorescence, multi-excitation TIRF, and other advanced microscopies. The Vanderbilt shared facilities system provides an efficient billing system, oversight and governance for the Cell Imaging Core at no extra cost to VDDRC members. The VDDRC Cell Imaging Core will continue to be a critical component in Vanderbilt's broad range of digestive disease research resources and will provide essential services that support the research of VDDRC-affiliated investigators during the next funding cycle."
"9307993","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are serious and debilitating mental illnesses that incur substantial suffering for patients and major challenges to our health care system. The clinical high-risk (CHR) prodromal phase is the period prior to the onset of psychosis when clinical symptoms gradually emerge and function declines. The presence of a CHR syndrome in young adults is associated with heightened risk (~30%) for the later development of psychosis. The North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and other CHR studies have made substantial progress towards predicting psychosis, and in showing an accelerated reduction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) gray matter (GM) density in CHR converters from pre- to post-psychosis onset, but the mechanisms driving conversion remain elusive, partly because no studies include repeated measures prior to the onset of psychosis. In NAPLS2, we found that disrupted resting-state (rs) thalamo- cortical functional connectivity prior to psychosis predicts conversion and correlates with rate of GM decline, but we do not know if rs-dysconnectivity is progressive during the prodrome. Furthermore, in NAPLS2, plasma markers of pro-inflammatory cytokines at baseline predicted the rate of GM loss in converters; these same markers also correlated with rs-dysconnectivity. We do not yet know whether these inflammatory markers drive the changes in brain structure/function or are consequences of these changes. Similarly, higher levels of cortisol, and lower mismatch negativity predicted psychosis and the rate of PFC GM decline and were correlated with each other and with measures of rs-connectivity and cytokines.  This application is a competitive renewal for a nine-site, longitudinal study aimed at identifying the brain processes underlying the progression of the clinical syndromes that characterize the psychosis prodrome. The goals are: 1) to determine the pre-onset trajectories of GM decline and disrupted resting-state brain connectivity in CHR individuals who develop psychosis using MRI, and 2) to identify inflammatory and plasticity mechanisms associated with transition to psychosis. Over a two-year period, the study will repeatedly measure these indicators, and at the same time examine changes in physiological indices of brain function, social and cognitive functioning, and symptom progression. The multi-site collaboration will follow large CHR (n= 378) and demographically matched comparison (n= 162) samples that will undergo comprehensive assessments of biological and behavioral changes. This approach will answer important questions about the origins of the brain changes that give rise to psychosis and will provide insights into likely approaches to halting or mitigatig the pathological process and advance our understanding of risk prediction, both critical steps in prevention."
"9483173","Project Abstract Infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal tract are a significant cause of infant mortality and morbidity in the developing world. Globally over 1 billion people are infected with gastrointestinal helminths and diarrheal disease is the second leading cause of death in children under 5, killing approximately 2 million children every year. Vaccination is one of the most cost-effective health interventions that can protect people from infection in endemic areas, saving millions of lives every year. Although vaccines currently exist to protect against infection with rotavirus and cholera, uptake of these vaccines in developing countries is poor due to the financial cost. Furthermore there is an urgent need for the development of new vaccines that provide protection against other diseases of the gastrointestinal tract. This proposal will develop a new affordable vaccine delivery platform that uses the probiotic yeast Saccharomyce cerevisiae boulardii to deliver vaccines directly to the gastrointestinal tract. Using genetic techniques already established for Saccharomyces cerevisiae I will genetically engineer S. boulardii to express antigens that induce protective immune responses fused to a novel adjuvant technology, ImmunobodiesTM. Oral administration of genetically transformed S. boulardii will facilitate expression of these fusion proteins in situ at the mucosal surface. The generation of immune responses by antigen-ImmunobodyTM fusion proteins delivered by genetically transformed S. boulardii via oral vaccination will be initially demonstrated in mice using model antigen to describe the baseline immune responses generated by different dosing regimens. Co-administration of S. boulardii expressing mouse polarizing cytokines will facilitate the arming of different the immune effector mechanisms driven by Th1, Th2 or Th17 responses. This will be important because different types of pathogens require different immune effector mechanisms for clearance. I will also examine the longevity of the immune responses generated by this vaccine delivery platform by assaying for memory responses (plasmablasts and central memory T cells) in mice responding to antigen challenge. The protective nature of the immune responses generated will be demonstrated using a mouse model of diarrheal infection, Cryptosporidium parvum. Defined vaccine targets against C. parvum will be expressed by S. boulardii as ImmunobodyTM fusion proteins and the vaccinated mice challenged with C. parvuum infection. Lastly I will generate auxotrophic mutants of S. boulardii to facilitate large-scale production of this vaccine delivery platform in developing countries removing the requirement for costly antibiotic selection. This project will radically change the way vaccines are administered both in developed and developing countries."
"9308950","ABSTRACT Erythrocytes (red blood cells; RBCs) and their progenitors express distinct proteins, which underlie their unique biology, and which provide a molecular basis for many blood diseases, including diverse anemias, such as those arising during renal failures as a result of low red blood cell production and lifespan. Importantly, mammalian RBCs lack nuclei and other major organelles, and hence neither transcriptional profiling by RNA- sequencing nor recombinant transfection?powerful techniques in other cell types?can be used to reveal RBC gene functions and pathways. Proteomics methods, in contrast, allow for a detailed analysis of RBC proteins, and pioneering studies have revealed that RBCs, while dominated by hemoglobin (98%), express on the order of 1,500 to 2,000 distinct proteins. Many of these proteins play critical roles in erythrocyte function, including key metabolic and bioenergy roles, and cytoskeletal roles in controlling RBC cell shape. More than 500 proteins in RBCs are of entirely unknown function. A fundamental question in RBC biology is thus how all of these proteins work together to support proper RBC function and development. Building deep mechanistic understanding of RBC biology requires accurately delineating the precise membership of protein complexes specific to RBCs, as these carry out key functions unique to these cells. We propose to perform the first systematic, global exploration of native protein-protein interactions (PPIs) in RBCs, using a powerful new technology to examine those interactions directly among endogenous proteins in human and other mammalian RBCs. Our proposed experiments combine protein biochemistry, quantitative mass spectrometry proteomics and integrative computer modeling to reliably define the extended PPI networks and multiprotein complexes native to RBCs, helping to lay rich new mechanistic foundations for interpreting RBC biology. By the end of this grant, we will have performed nearly 2,000 mass spectrometry experiments on native protein complexes isolated from primary RBCs and their progenitors, defining the RBC interactome, including both shared and novel protein complexes, to an unprecedented degree. As a result of this work, RBCs will be the first primary human cell type with a near complete map of stable protein complexes, giving new insights into erythrocyte biology and development, and laying the foundation for future attempts to intervene, chemically or genetically, in diseases affecting these critical cells.  "
"9352471","Project Summary ? Project 1 Phenotypic hallmarks of intoxication with seizure-inducing chemical threat agents include: (1) acute hyperexcitation of neural circuits associated with seizures and status epilepticus (SE); and (2) chronic neuroinflammation and neuropathology that manifest subsequent to seizures. Project 1 is using in vitro models essential for elucidating toxicological and therapeutic mechanisms and for discovering intervention strategies that are more effective and safer than current medical countermeasures (atropine, oxime, high-dose benzodiazepines) for treating acute intoxication and protecting against persistent neuropathology. Our focus is on two classes of threat agents: those that block GABAA receptor (GABAAR) function, e.g., tetramethylene- disulfotetramine (TETS) and picrotoxin (PTX, and organophosphates (OP) that inhibit cholinesterases, e.g., diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP) and paraoxon (PO). Our hypothesis is that in vitro approaches we developed during the first project period can be used to identify, refine and optimize combinatorial therapies that more effectively target TETS- and OP-triggered seizure mechanisms and control subsequent neuroinflammation. This hypothesis will be tested using in vitro and ex vivo rodent models of both sexes. Aim-1 will determine whether midazolam plus a neurosteroid is more potent than either alone for normalizing TETS and PTX- triggered neuronal network hyperexcitability. In Aim 2 we will test whether subtype selective nicotinic cholinergic receptor (nAChR) inhibitors are superior to our standard midazolam ± neurosteroid combination or synergize with it in mitigating OP-triggered seizure-like activity in adult neuron/glia cocultures. Our reasoning is based on the known cholinergic mechanisms of seizure initiation. Aim 3 will investigate neuroinflammation by evaluating astrogliosis, microglial activation, and neuropathology following exposure to seizure-inducing chemical threat agents and screen for anti-inflammatory compounds that can mitigate these processes. We have developed two cell-based models (astrocyte/microglia and neuron/glia cocultures) from mouse and rat models of both sexes to quantitatively measure differences in neuroinflammation (astrogliosis and microglia activation) and their relationship to neuropathology over acute and prolonged exposures to chemical threat agents. Results obtained from these three aims will be critical for identifying and prioritizing the most promising candidate therapeutics for mitigating seizure-like activity, neuroinflammation and neuropathology to be testedin vivo by Projects 2 and 3."
"9324985","Project Summary / Abstract ? Core C. Metabolism, Bariatric Surgery and Behavior Core The primary goals and function of the Metabolism, Bariatric Surgery and Behavior Core are to provide expert consultation, state-of-the art equipment and technical services that are critical for the detailed metabolic and behavioral phenotyping of mouse models of diabetes, obesity and associated disorders. A thorough understanding of the physiological responses to nutrients and environmental factors and of the pathophysiological mechanisms that contribute to diabetes and related metabolic diseases is required if we are to effectively combat these conditions. However, the resources and technology necessary to phenotypically probe whole animal models of altered glucose homeostasis and metabolism at a level that reveals basic underlying mechanisms of control are not available in most investigators' laboratories. The Metabolism, Bariatric Surgery and Behavior Core meets these needs through a comprehensive, convenient and cost- effective menu of platforms that includes: a) Glucose homeostasis and metabolic clamps. The Core performs hyperinsulinemic clamp studies including specialized analysis of metabolite storage and release in mice. b) Whole animal metabolic assessment: The CLAMS and TSE indirect calorimetry systems are used to examine metabolic rate, respiratory quotient, food consumption, and locomotor activity in mouse models. c) Body composition measurement by NMR. d) Radiotelemetric monitoring of diurnal running wheel behavior in mice. e) Ingestive behavior: Meal microstructure and reinforcing properties of dietary constituents are measured in either home-cage or operant-conditioning paradigms. f) Automated blood/body fluids sampling and infusion utilizing a Culex/Empis platform to remotely collect serial samples and infuse substances to freely behaving, unstressed mice. g) Vertical sleeve gastrectomy model of bariatric surgery is performed in mice and subsequent phenotyping can be performed with the combined resources of all the Cores in the Michigan MMPC. Altogether, the Metabolism, Bariatric Surgery and Behavior Core provides consultation and advice on experimental design, reliable data from a range of validated assays, essential data analysis relevant to the needs of multiple investigators and training opportunities in the established methodologies of the Core to researchers both at the University of Michigan and throughout the country."

"9319033","Abstract  The overall goal of this Program Project Group is to understand the mechanisms underlying  renal fluid, electrolyte and macromolecule transport. Kinase and phosphatases are essential  regulators of this process and thus, by extension, their target phosphorylation sites are  important for mechanistic insight. This core will add value to the project group by bringing new  capabilities and expertise in the identification and characterization of phosphorylation sites in  proteins and proteomes. Dr. Jesse Rinehart will assume the role as the Phosphoproteomics  Core Director and will bring expertise in phosphorylation mapping, quantitative proteomics, and  phosphoprotein synthesis to the Program Project Group. Dr. Rinehart recently developed a new  technology which enables site-specific incorporation of phosphoserine into proteins. This  technology enables the synthesis of physiologically relevant phosphoproteins in an E. coli strain  with an expanded genetic code. This unique technology and a recently published next-  generation phosphoserine technology will be uniquely available to this Program Project Group.  The combinations of established phosphoproteomics technologies and novel phosphoprotein  synthesis technologies will enable a unique approach to validation and further exploration of the  mechanisms of protein phosphorylation. The core will be an excellent learning environment and  bring trainees from the Program Project Groups in close contact with proteomics experts in the  Rinehart lab. This training environment will provide access to state-of-the-art technology to the  individual members of the Project Group. Dr. Rinehart's research interests are closely aligned  with the aims of this project group and, in addition to the technology, the unique lab environment  is value added to the Program Project Group."
"9405324","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this fellowship is to examine the stability of early childhood environmental ecologies and how instability in these ecological settings affect childhood health and well-being and broader patterns of population-level inequality. Prior literature investigating childhood inequality and ecological instability has typically examined point-in-time exposure to ecological contexts or focused on instability in only one domain. This study extends the existing literature by taking a dynamic, multi-dimensional, and child-centered approach to the short- and long-term developmental implications of ecological instability. This study bridges conceptual ideas from sociology, demography, and developmental psychology to accomplish this goal. In this effort, this study asks three main questions: (1) what does instabiliy in the work-family-care nexus look like during the first five years of children's lives; (2) do children influence their own experience of ecological instability during early childhood, and if so what factors (e.g., physical health, social behavior) are most likely to affect these settings; (3)is early childhood instability associated with children's middle and late childhood health and well-being? Moreover, an important component of this research is to examine how these trends differ by children's socioeconomic status, which can speak to how ecological instability shapes the intergenerational transmission of inequality. In answering these questions, this study draws on two complementary sources of data: The NICHD Study of Early Child Care and Youth Development (SECCYD) and the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing Study (FFCW). These datasets allow for the close examination of changes in family structure, mothers' work characteristics, and children's extra-familial care because of the detailed collection of information during frequent interviews with families over early childhood. In addition, both datasets have objective and subjective measures of children's development, including their physical health, behavioral, and academic outcomes in middle and late childhood. The analytic plan uses latent class analysis (LCA) to identify the ecological instability experience over early childhood, and cross-lagged structural equation models and regression analysis to examine the role children play in influencing their ecological contexts and how early childhood instability may  be associated with children's poorer health and well-being in middle and late childhood. Additional statistical techniques will be used to address selection bias and causal inference. This theoretically grounded study has important implications for policy. Understanding what types of instability put specific groups of families at risk for subsequent instability in other domains and which instability profiles are associated with poorer childhood health and well-being can inform policy and interventions targeting vulnerable children and families and speak to larger trends in population health and well-being inequalities."

"9327051","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pediatric pulmonary vascular diseases (PVD), including pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH), are high morbidity and mortality conditions, yet treatment options are limited. Despite new drug therapies, survival of patients with severe PH remains poor. Although most clinical studies have emphasized disease in adults, pediatric PVD can be devastating, contributing substantially to poor outcomes in newborns, infants and children that are strikingly different from those encountered in adults. Unfortunately, very few studies have addressed the safety and efficacy of PVD therapies in children. Current approaches to PVD are limited by small numbers of patients with PH and the association of PH with a variety of pediatric disorders and subspecialties at any individual center; by few established, multidisciplinary programs in pediatric PH; and by limited interactions among existing PVD programs. Multi-center investigations are necessary for sufficiently powered interventional studies, but study designs have been restricted by lack of knowledge as to disease phenotypes, clinical course, outcomes, and age-appropriate endpoints. Our objective, therefore, is the establishment and operation of a Bioinformatics Clinical Coordinating Center (BCCC) for advancing the understanding and treatment of PVD in children, comprised of national leaders in pediatric pulmonary and cardiac medicine, informatics, and biostatistics as well as registry-based and electronic health records (EHR) clinical research. We leverage and extend the existing Pediatric Pulmonary Hypertension Network (PPHnet) for large-scale registry and EHR-based research, using a well tested and widely adopted open-source data warehouse technology infrastructure (i2b2/SHRINE), developed through the NIH National Centers for Biocomputing and Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) Programs. The goal of this proposal is three-fold: (1) establish a sustainable, open source, reusable registry infrastructure across 8 PPHnet sites to capture multi-sourced EHR, traditional prospective patient-based data, and patient reported outcomes (PROs) across a large, prospective, pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) observational cohort; (2) enroll >500 registry subjects and capture data on >750 EHR subjects across 8 PPHnet sites, linking EHR with registry data at 3 sites; (3) address three classes of unanswered questions crucial for the characterization and management of PH, comparing the information value of registry vs. EHR vs. fused data across registry/EHR/PROs, in the domains of spectrum of PH comorbidities, PH indicators and endpoints of morbidity and mortality, and response to therapies in PH."

"9353410","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The obesity pandemic continues unabated in Western societies and it is rising dramatically in the rest of the world. Coinciding with the rise of obesity worldwide there has been a proportional increase in highly prevalent disorders such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and fatty liver disease. It is well established that obesity is associated with systemic chronic inflammation and that this inflammatory state contributes to the development of insulin resistance (IR); which is a hallmark in the pathogenesis of obesity-associated diseases. The elevated inflammatory status of obese individuals primarily originates from immune cells within visceral adipose tissue (VAT). Thus, understanding the molecular mechanisms that lead to VAT inflammation and IR is essential for the development of future therapies. Although studies in the last decade have uncovered key cytokines and immune cell populations that promote VAT chronic inflammation and IR, the triggering events that lead to immune cell dysfunction and VAT inflammation during obesity are poorly understood. In recent years, it has become clear that miRNAs are critical regulators of immune cells; however, little is known about how families of miRNAs regulate VAT chronic inflammatory processes during obesity. miR-181 is a highly conserved family of six miRNAs encoded by three separate clusters that is preferentially expressed in the hematopoietic system. Using miR-181-deficient mouse models, we have made three key observations that suggest that this miRNA family might play an important role in the development of VAT inflammation and IR: (i) All miR-181 family members are significantly upregulated in VAT during diet induced obesity (DIO) in mouse and humans, (ii) genetic ablation of the miR-181 family leads to significantly reduced total fat mass and improved insulin sensitivity, and (iii) the miR-181 family is critical for the function of immune cells known to infiltrate VAT during DIO. Thus, we hypothesize that the miR-181 family is expressed in specific cell types within VAT where it is instrumental in regulating gene expression programs that determine insulin sensitivity and susceptibility to obesity. Using state-of-the-art methodologies this proposal seeks to identify the cell-specific functions of the miR-181 family in VAT using a murine model of DIO. In Aim 1, we will use novel mouse models to identify the cell type within VAT in which the miR-181 family exerts its effects on insulin sensitivity and body composition. In Aim 2, we will use the CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing technology to establish the transcription factors that induce the expression of the miR-181 family within VAT during DIO. Finally, in aim 3, we will identify the targets of miR-181 within immune cells that determine insulin sensitivity in the context of obesity. In summary, this proposal will test a previously unexplored function of the miR-181 family and represents a novel avenue in obesity research. Furthermore, the information obtained during these studies could potentially lead to the identification of novel therapeutic targets for to treat obesity-associated disorders."
"9392721","Summary Three cohorts of WTC rescue and recovery workers maintained at the Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY), the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (WTC General Responders Cohort, WTCGRC), and the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (WTC Health Registry, WTCHR) are currently engaged in a combined (pooled) analysis of cancer risk, latency and survival. Mortality among WTC rescue and recovery workers from the WTCHR and the WTCGRC cohorts, compared to the general population and based on relatively small numbers of deaths, showed a strong healthy worker effect HWE. This comparison can obfuscate increases in mortality due to WTC-related exposure. We propose to use the combined dataset of the three cohorts to analyze overall mortality and causes of death with sufficient number of events, taking advantage of the larger number of expected deaths and the additional time elapsed, and to use multiple causes of death. Specifically, we plan to perform a follow-up of mortality in a combined dataset of rescue and recovery workers from the three WTC cohorts, to use the combined WTC cohort to estimate overall mortality, and mortality from major causes, and to compare them to external reference rates. In addition, we plan to assess the role of WTC exposure in determining overall mortality and mortality from major causes among WTC rescue and recovery workers, and its possible interaction with other determinants of death (tobacco smoking, co-morbidities), in explaining the decreased mortality compared to the external reference populations. We further plan to estimate the temporal pattern of overall and cause-specific mortality in WTC rescue and recovery workers, notably whether mortality increases with time from the attacks. Finally, we plan to compare overall mortality and mortality from major causes of specific occupational groups within the WTC combined cohort, including police officers, firefighters, and construction workers, with other cohorts of the same groups of workers. The proposed analysis will provide strong evidence on the presence or absence of an association of WTC exposure and mortality among rescue/recovery workers, after accounting for other major determinants of mortality, and will inform on the best methodology to quantitative assess the effects of disasters on mortality of exposed individuals."
"9321381","Project Summary/Abstract Findings from several studies conducted in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) suggest that adults in the region have higher prevalence of depression than their counterparts in many middle- and high-income countries. The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated that mental and substance use disorders account for 19% of disability years in sub-Saharan Africa and the South African Stress and Health study ? conducted in 2003-2004 as part of the World Health Organization's World Mental Health Survey Initiative ? found a lifetime and 12- month prevalence of mental disorders of 30.3% and 16.5%, respectively. Despite the high prevalence, however, little is known about the determinants as well as the dynamics of mental health outcomes in the region. Prior research in SSA has largely relied on a few cross-sectional datasets and focused on the association between mental health and a limited set of demographic characteristics. While studies outside SSA have utilized longitudinal data to examine how economic crises, natural disasters, and other stressful life events (SLEs) influence mental health outcomes, there has been little to no research on such effects in SSA despite the twin significance of disease- and accident-related mortality and mental disorders in the region. The proposed project will fill this important gap by utilizing data from the first nationally representative longitudinal survey of the South African population, the National Income Dynamics Study (NIDS). The NIDS data span a 7- year period (2008-2015), contain detailed information on mortality and other SLEs within households, and include measures of depressive symptoms for all adult household members. Aim 1 of the project is to explore and assess trends in mental health in South Africa over a 7-year period, including transitions into or out of poor mental health and the role of individual, household, and community factors in explaining these transitions. Aim 2 of the project is to determine patterns in depression before and after the mortality of a household member as well as other positive and negative events occurring in the household. Analyses will use panel data regression techniques including models with individual fixed effects and time trends. The project will ultimately enhance our understanding of how mortality is influencing mental health outcomes in South Africa and help determine the level of need for mental health services as well as ways to improve the targeted provision of such services."
"9351169","Project Summary  In mammals, the urethra is the sole pathway for excretion of urine from the body and it is the primary point of entry for lower urinary tract infections and sexually transmitted diseases. Urethral malformations are among the most common birth defects in humans, yet our understanding of the molecular development of the urethra lags years, perhaps decades, behind other systems, such as the CNS, gut, and limbs. The anterior to posterior (A-P) axis of the urethra extends from the bladder to the urethral meatus, which opens at the tip of the penis in males or between the vaginal opening and the clitoris in females. At the cell and tissue levels, the urethral tube shows extensive heterogeneity along its A-P axis. Epithelial structure varies along this axis, with the linings of the pre-prostatic, prostatic, membranous, and penile urethra each having a distinctive character. Moreover, morphogenetic processes occur at discrete A-P positions along the urogenital sinus. For example, the accessory sex glands, such as the prostate and bulbourethral glands bud off the urogenital sinus at specific axial levels. Muscular sphincters also develop at highly localized regions. Despite this extensive anatomical regionalization, the molecular anatomy that establishes these patterns is not understood. In addition to this developmental significance, A-P identity of cells may influence adult function. Do male-female differences in cell type identity and molecular immunologic profiles along the A-P axis of the uretha influence colonization of the urethra and bladder by pathogens? Here we propose that specification of cell type identity along the urogenital sinus can be approached as a fundamental developmental problem of A-P regionalization. Analogous processes have been studied extensively in the gastrointestinal tract, resulting in a detailed picture of gut regionalization, sphincter development, specification of the positions and identities of organs, and control of cell type identities within those organs. Building on our GUDMAP2 project, which focused on the dorsoventral (D-V) axis of the LUT, this study aims to identify and map the molecular regionalization of cells along the A-P axis of the mouse and human urethra, from the bladder to the urethral meatus. We will use laser capture microdissection to isolate urethral cells from the pre-prostatic, prostatic, membranous, and penile regions of mouse and human urethra and use RNAseq to identify their transcriptional profiles. We will then carry out a comparative in situ hybridization analysis of mouse and human urethrae in sections and whole mounts, and we will use Optical Projection Tomography to map A-P patterns of gene expression in 3D. Our goal is to generate the foundation of gene expression data necessary for the urology research community to study how cell type identity along the urethra relates to development of congenital defects and to disease.  "
"9280966","Project B - Inner Ear Hair Cells: Bundle Development and Regeneration  Manfred Auer  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   The hair bundle is a precision organelle responsible for mechanoelectrical transduction in vertebrate  animal hair cells in inner ear and lateral line sensory system. It consists of stereocilia that contain a crosslinked  actin bundle, which is connected to the surrounding plasma membrane via unconventional myosins (and also  radixin). Correlative quantitative proteomics and 3D tomographic studies of resin-embedded chick utricle tissue  sections have revealed the macromolecular inventory and an only partially ordered 3D organization. This  proposal focuses on vitrified whole-mount stereocilia samples using cryo-tomography, which ensures nearest-  to-native sample preservation and eliminates the lengthy search for adequate section geometry e.g. for  visualization of the adaptation machinery.   We propose to complete our 3D analysis of the unstained actin core, localize and identify  unconventional myosins through positive heavy metal staining cryo-tomography and template matching, as  well as immunocytochemical labeling of permeabilized or demembranated vitrified whole-mount stereocilia. We  propose to identify the different localized unconventional myosin using known differences in macromolecular  dimensions, dimerization state, and preferred regional distribution. Last we will study hair bundles of  regenerated hair cells in zebrafish lateral line neuromast, chick utricle sensory epithelia and blotted stereocilia  and embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cell (ESC/iPSC)-derived hair cell-like cells.   We will test the hypotheses that (1) the actin core is organized more like a gel rather than a  paracrystal; (2) there is a defined ultrastructural correlate of the predicted MYO1C-based adaptation  machinery; (3) the different unconventional myosins residing in the hair bundle occupy different territories in  stereocilia using whole-mount immuno-affinity labeling and heavy metal staining or prior to vitrification and  cryo-EM imaging; (4) the hair bundle and stereocilia organization of regenerated hair cells ressembles those of  untreated chick utricle and zebrafish lateral line hair bundles/stereocilia.   We believe that our ultrastructural and affinity-labeling approaches will help settle a number of  questions in the hair cell field, e.g. regarding actin organization and turnover, as well as unconventional myosin  localization and function. Also, it will provide an ultrastructural framework in which to interpret other types of  data with respect to hair cell regeneration. Last but not least our proposal provides a strong technical platform  for future ultrastructural hair cell studies and beyond for the field of structural cell biology."

"9321885","The early stages of respiratory system development including branching morphogenesis and cell lineage commitment have been studied extensively and this has led to a dramatic increase in our understanding of how the trachea and lungs are specified and how endodermal lineages commit to different epithelial cell fates. However, less is known about the late stages of development and maturation, which are required to form the air-vascular interface important for gas exchange in the postnatal lung. These later steps of lung development involve dramatic changes in cellular differentiation and morphology, resulting in the dilation and expansion of the distal saccules and eventual septation of these saccules into alveoli to increase surface area for efficient gas exchange. The importance of these steps is highlighted by defects in these morphological processes resulting in poorly understood syndromes including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which can lead to severe neonatal distress or death. Despite the importance of lung sacculation and alveologenesis, the molecular pathways involved and the cellular remodeling that is required for these steps remains poorly understood. We have previously shown that the class I histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1 and -2) are essential for development of the proximal Sox2+ lung endoderm progenitors, resulting in the loss of proximal airway epithelial differentiation. We now show that the class I HDAC, HDAC3, regulates late lung epithelial maturation and cellular remodeling essential for sacculation and early alveologenesis. Our preliminary data suggest that HDAC3 regulates sacculation and early alveologenesis through repression of a miRNA program including the miR17-92 cluster. De- repression of miR17-92 in HDAC3 deficient lung epithelium leads to inhibition of Tgf-? signaling as miR17-92 targets multiple components of the Tgf-? pathway including Tgf-?2, Tgf-?R1, Tgf-?R2. The resultant decrease in Tgf-? signaling activity leads to a failure of AT1 cells to spread and remodel, causing a lack of saccule/alveolar airspace expansion and neonatal death. Interestingly, these defects are not associated with an observed change in AT1 cell specification or commitment. Preliminary data also shows that HDAC3 regulates the alveolar epithelial response to injury in the adult lung. These findings will have a broad impact on our understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms and cellular remodeling required for proper late lung development as well as postnatal repair and regeneration.  "
"9394541","Project Summary/Abstract The purpose of this training application is to provide the applicant with the skills and research experience to become an independent investigator studying functional status in older adults and related health outcomes, including life satisfaction and mortality. Almost half of older adults experience a decline in functional status as they age. For hospitalized older adults, the transition from hospital to home is a crucial time in terms of function, with half of older adults experiencing continued decline in the first year post discharge. Decline in functional status has many consequences, including decreased ability to live independently at home, poorer quality of life, increased caregiver burden, increased need for additional home care services, and eventually long-term care placement. Over one third of the population of older adults have been hospitalized a year and the number of older adults in the US is increasing. Given the high-risk transition from hospital to home, it is crucial that we better understand how older adults experience functional status during this crucial time. The current tools used to measure functional status include activities of daily living (ADLs) and instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). However, ADL and IADL tools were developed by clinicians to track progress in rehabilitation and assess primarily one domain of function?physical. Other non-physical domains, such as leisure, productive, and social activities, are critical components of older adults? functional status. These non- physical domains of functional status have been related to important outcomes (including life satisfaction and mortality), but have not been developed for use as markers in older adults transitioning from the hospital to home. Given that we do not know which domains of functional status may be best suited for social markers in the transition from hospital to home, grounded theory is the best approach to understand how older adults experience functional status during the transition from hospital to home. The aims of the proposed study are the following: (1) determine how older adults perceive non-physical functional domains during the transition from hospital to home, (2) understand what actions older adults take to maintain or improve non-physical functional domains during the transition from hospital to home and the consequences of these actions, and (3) construct a conceptual model that illustrates the process older adults engage in to maintain non-physical functional domains during the transition from hospital to home. This training grant will support the applicant?s short-term goals of building a foundation of knowledge related to non-physical domains of functional status and becoming an independent nurse researcher. The applicant?s long-term goal is to design community-based interventions to improve older adults? life satisfaction and health outcomes, e.g., mortality, during the transition from the hospital to home. This study directly aligns with the NINR mission of promoting and improving the health of individuals."
"9388788","PROJECT SUMMARY: In its recently released report, Improving Diagnosis in Health Care, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) highlighted that most individuals will experience at least one diagnostic error in their lifetime, sometimes with devastating consequences. Compared to other healthcare settings, clinicians working in emergency departments (EDs) are particularly vulnerable to making diagnostic errors due to time-pressured decision-making in a busy and often chaotic environment. In addition to this, provision of emergency care to children is complicated by their unique needs such as weight-based dosing of medications, their inability to verbalize their symptoms and often, their dependence on parents/guardians even for accessing healthcare. There are approximately 25 million annual pediatric ED visits in the United States. A conservative estimate of 5% prevalence, translates into ~ 1.25 million potential annual cases of diagnostic errors in the pediatric ED. To date, there has been no systematic research on diagnostic errors in the pediatric emergencies. Diagnostic errors, when defined as the inability to make a correct or timely diagnosis based on available evidence (i.e. missed opportunities for improving diagnosis or MOIDs), have been investigated in adult, outpatient settings. Members of our research team have used electronic health record based triggers to detect MOIDs and study the factors that cause diagnostic errors. Our long-term goal is to better understand MOIDs in pediatric EDs to ultimately decrease their prevalence. To accomplish that, in this project, we will assemble a multidisciplinary panel of experts in diagnostic decision making, pediatric emergency medicine along with patient/family advisory boards to develop a pediatric ED relevant model to identify triggers and subsequently use them to measure the frequency as well as contributing factors of diagnostic errors in four pediatric EDs. Our project is significant, innovative, and timely because it will lay the foundation for development of error detection tools that can be used to provide timely feedback to clinicians, track institutional or clinician performance, and measure impact of error mitigation strategies."

"9293132","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This resubmission of a NEW INVESTIGATOR led longitudinal study is in response to (PA-11-104) and will examine: (1) the impact of (GXE) genetic and psychological environmental factors (discrimination, depression, and parenting behaviors) on the health of African American (AA) children aged 3 through 5 years and (2) the GXE risk for hypertension (HTN) in AA women and children. The overall goal of this project is to delineate the psychobiological (GXE interaction) mechanisms through which AA mothers' perceived racial discrimination, mental health, and parenting behavior affect their own and their young children's blood pressure (BP) over time. Our research will examine both genetic (candidate gene and epigenetic effects) and psychological (maternal perceived racial discrimination, mental health, and parenting behavior) interaction effects on BP on this population. We will employ a psychobiological approach by: utilizing psychological and biological assessments using a longitudinal cohort research design, a 2-step candidate gene and epigenetic methodology, and use of ancestry informative markers to account for population stratification admixture to explore GXE interactions on BP in AA mothers and children. Data analysis for the study will be conducted using multiple mixed modeling, cross-validation, and false discovery rate methods. We will enroll 250 AA children aged 3 through 5 years and their (n=250) mothers/maternal caregivers. We will assess mother and child factors every six months for 2 years. We propose the following: Aim 1: Examine the GXE interaction and epigenetic effects of mothers' perceived racial discrimination and its influence on BP over a period of two years. Aim 2: Examine the GXE interaction and epigenetic effects of mothers' mental health status [symptoms of depression] and its influence on BP over a period of two years. Aim 3: Examine the GXE interaction and epigenetic effects of mothers' parenting behavior and its influence on BP over a period of two years. Our project supports NINR's mission to promote and improve the health of individuals, families, communities, and populations by conducting basic research on the health and illness of women and young children. The proposed research extends nursing science by integrating the biological (genetics) and behavioral (psychology) components that can inform the combination of multi-level factors that contribute to AAs having the highest incidence of HTN in the US. Findings from our project can contribute to developing interventions that address genetic and psychological factors to reduce these risks for HTN."
"9423742","Title: Mechanisms that determine subcellular sites of HIV-1 assembly Summary/Abstract: Virus particle assembly of HIV-1, the causative agent of AIDS, takes place at the plasma membrane (PM) in most cell types including natural host T cells. This process is driven by a viral structural protein Gag. The N- terminal matrix (MA) domain of Gag determines Gag localization to and hence virus assembly at the PM. MA mediates membrane binding of Gag via N-terminal myristoyl moiety and a highly basic region (HBR) that binds acidic lipids. Binding of HBR to a PM-specific acidic phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 is critical for PM localization of Gag and efficient virus release. Notably, in vitro and cell-based studies showed that MA HBR also interacts with tRNAs, which suppress binding of Gag to non-PI(4,5)P2 acidic lipids, suggesting tRNAs as a new host factor that regulates MA-membrane interactions. However, molecular determinants for the tRNA-MA HBR interaction and its reversal by the interaction with PI(4,5)P2, combination of which regulates PM-specific Gag localization, remain to be elucidated. Moreover, how these interactions begin and what effect these interactions have on the property of progeny virions at the end are poorly understood. Binding of tRNAs to MA HBR is most likely to occur at translation sites due to limited availability of tRNAs outside of the translation machinery. However, little is known about subcellular sites of Gag translation, where Gag begins its movement to the PM. At the PM, Gag multimerization is likely to create accumulation of acidic lipids, but its impact on the ability of progeny virions to spread to uninfected cells remains unknown. Our long-term goal is to elucidate mechanisms that determine sites of HIV-1 assembly and to use the knowledge for developing antiviral strategies. Our central hypothesis in this application is that MA HBR interactions with tRNAs, which begin during translation, and with acidic lipids determine subcellular Gag localization and the properties of progeny virions. To test this hypothesis, we plan to: 1) identify molecular determinants for interaction of MA HBR with tRNAs and its reversal by PI(4,5)P2; 2) identify tRNAs that suppress PI(4,5)P2-independent membrane binding but allow PI(4,5)P2-mediated reversal; 3) examine the possibility that Gag associates with tRNA during translation; and 4) examine the effect of acidic lipid accumulation at virus assembly sites on the virion properties. The knowledge gained from experiments outlined in this proposal will likely help us develop antiviral strategies that target mechanisms regulating Gag localization to the PM, thereby inhibiting extracellular virus release and spread."

The candidate is establishing his career as a neurologist - neuroscientist in the fields of movement disorders and neurodegenerative disease. The objective of this five-year project is to develop two new biomarkers based on alpha-synuclein and apply these biomarkers to the study of Parkinson disease (PD). The candidate is mentored by Drs. Virginia Lee and John Trojanowski, who co-direct the Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research (CNDR) at U Penn, and by Dr. Matthew Stern, Director of the Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorders Center (PD&MDC) at U Penn. These individuals have a long history of training successful physician - scientists. The CNDR is a multi- disciplinary research laboratory with in-house expertise in protein biochemistry and molecular biology, cell culture, microscopy, histopathology, small animal surgery, drug development, and high throughput assays. The CNDR and PD&MDC also have a multimodal database of clinical data, biological fluid samples, imaging studies, and autopsy specimens cultivated via several NIH funded Program Project Grants at U Penn, which the candidate will utilize to achieve the Aims of this project. The candidate has assembled a team of clinical and research mentors and a structured training plan to develop the necessary skill-set to transition to independence in neurodegenerative disease research. Alpha-synuclein is an amyloid genic protein and thought to be central to the pathogenesis of PD. When misfolded, phosphorylated, or post-transnationally modified, alpha-synuclein appears to confer toxicity to cells by adopting pathological conformations. While all patients with PD have neuron loss and protein aggregates that contain alpha-synuclein in the brain, not all patients follow the same disease course or develop the same complications. The clinical heterogeneity of PD remains poorly explained by what is known regarding the underlying neuropathology. There are currently no biomarkers to measure the spread of alpha-synuclein pathology through the brain, and no treatments for PD appear to modify the disease course. This project will test the hypothesis that alpha-synuclein auto-antibodies (Aim #1) and pathologic forms of alpha-synuclein (Aim #2) are biomarkers for PD. The approach taken will be to develop two ELISA based assays for these biomarkers, and then validate each assay in a mouse model of transmissible synucleinopathy (Aim #3). Each assay will be rigorously tested using newly generated antibodies and truncated, phosphorylated, and fibrillary forms of recombinant alpha-syncline. Once developed, these assays will be used to test serum and CSF from CNDR and correlate each biomarker to clinical disease state using a multi-modal approach. This project will provide the necessary research skills and training to allow the candidate to translate these biomarkers to clinical care and to develop an independent research laboratory focused on mechanisms of PD pathogenesis."

Project Summary/Abstract: There is a worldwide movement in the early intervention for adolescents and young adults appearing to develop early signs of psychosis or described as at clinical high risk (CHR) for psychosis, led mainly by researchers in Australia, Europe, and North America. Within the Asian Network for Early Psychosis, Taiwan and Singapore have started to address the CHR population. To our knowledge, we are the first research group carrying out CHR studies in a low-middle income country in Asia. Since 2012, supported by NIMH/Fogarty 1R21MH093294-01A1 and an NIMH R01 MH101052-01, we have worked closely with the Shanghai Mental Health Center (SMHC), to develop a CHR research program in Shanghai, China. The completed R21 and on-going R01 projects aim at identification of the risk factors for CHR conversion over approximately one year. In our current proposal, in response to NIH FOA PAR-14-332, Global Brain and Nervous System Disorders Research across the Lifespan (R01), we will continue to enhance research capacity building at SMHC, and collaboratively carry out an extensive follow-up study of clinical outcomes such as conversion to psychosis and level of disability, and we will evaluate the evolution of biomarkers such as event related potentials, resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), white matter as assessed by diffusion tensor imaging MRI, and neurocognition. We will follow-up 300 well characterized CHR and Healthy Control (HC) participants between the ages of 15-45 for two more follow-up assessments. The longitudinal nature of the project is novel in China and worldwide as this will be the first study to comprehensively examine biopsychosocial parameters predictive of psychosis conversion and illness progression for up to 6 years, including two new follow-ups of the biomarkers (4 assessments including baseline). Moreover, unlike many studies in the West, virtually 100% of the participants are psychotropically naïve when they enter the study, and the assessments are done at one site (SMHC), reducing confounds associated with medications and multiple sites. Our goal is to work collaboratively with researchers at the SMHC to establish a sustainable CHR longitudinal program of research in China and to lay a solid foundation for CHR early intervention.This project aims to: 1). Develop predictors for conversion to psychosis, 2). Investigate clinical and biomarker progression in CHR, 3). Demonstrate an association between clinical features, biological measures and disability in CHR, and 4). Explore the feasibility of early intervention with CHR subjects.

Once curated, the structured data can be used by biomedical researchers to generate novel scientific hypotheses, design new studies, obtain a better understanding of biological mechanisms of disease, perform meta-analyses, and create clinical decision support systems. There is an urgent need to develop improved search interfaces specific to the field of personalized therapy, including ways to display, rank, and save results by end users. While several database and web-based keyword search engine algorithms exist, there is a lack of tools that meet the unique challenges of personalized medicine. There is also an urgent need to develop software that allows for verification and validation of information extracted and ranked through computational methods using subject matter expertise to improve the gold standard corpus that can be used for biomedical research into personalized therapies.  To address these issues, we will build an innovative software stack (MACE2K) to adapt and extend widely tested Biocreative natural language processing (NLP) tools to automatically retrieve and pre-process targeted therapy information from clinicaltrials.gov, PubMed abstracts as well as open access articles, and conference proceedings. We will build an entity extraction cartridge to accurately parse gene mutations, translocations, gene expression, protein expression, and protein phosphorylation. A marker disambiguation cartridge will be built to assess for trial inclusion or exclusion criteria and to determine marker-related primary endpoints. We will include a ranking cartridge that uses the disambiguated information on markers, drugs and trials to provide a rigorous scoring of trials and studies according to their relevance for personalized medicine. A novel gamification cartridge will be built to allow subject matter experts to verify and validate the information corpus. Our research leverages National Cancer Institute's investments in several programs (many of which we are involved in) including the NCI drug dictionary, National Cancer Informatics Program (NCIP), I-SPY trials, and Center for cancer systems biology (CCSB) to efficiently accomplish our aims."
"9335174","Abstract: Even though study of clinical prostate specimen has demonstrated that tumor invasion of nerves correlates with poor prognosis, only recently have neural contributions to prostate carcinogenesis been discovered. Sympathetic nerves densely innervate the prostate, and increased sympathetic activity, as occurs in many disease states, is associated with an increased risk of developing prostate cancer and an increase in prostate cancer-specific mortality. Previous studies in our lab have demonstrated that sympathetic denervation of the prostate inhibits the progression of premalignant prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia PIN, and that this phenotype is mediated by ?2 and ?3 adrenergic receptors (Adrb2 and Adrb3) expressed on stromal cells. Our preliminary results indicate that (1) stromal Adrb2 and Adrb3 knockout inhibits tumor angiogenesis, (2) endothelial-specific Adrb2 deletion inhibits prostate cancer progression, and (3) gene expression analysis in endothelial cells isolated from high grade PIN tumors reveals a change in metabolic program. The goal of this project is to elucidate the mechanisms by which the sympathetic nervous system regulates tumor vascular development, and to study the role of chronic sympathetic hyperactivity on promoting prostate cancer progression. In order to examine the mechanisms by which sympathetic signals mediate tumor angiogenesis, we will quantify angiogenic changes in orthotopic cancer and matrix transplantation assays in conditional Adrb2 knockout animals, as well as perform ex vivo and in vitro metabolic assays to characterize the metabolic changes that occur in endothelial cells within the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, to assess whether manipulation of neural input to the prostate can regulate cancer progression, we will develop and employ optogenetics to regulate sympathetic activity to the prostate during early stage cancer and assess the effects of chronic stimulation and inhibition on carcinogenesis. Through these experiments we hope to gain a better understanding of how the sympathetic nervous system mediates prostate cancer progression, and identify novel targets for therapeutic intervention as well as develop innovative proof-of-concept tools to inform prognosis and treatment."
"9132662","When making intertemporal decisions like saving for retirement individuals need to form expectations over various uncertain future events, such as the chances of high medical expenditures or chances of survival into old age. Research on individuals' expectations has made considerable progress on how to elicit individuals' expectations about the future, leading to various subjective probabilities measures being added to a number of general-purpose surveys. While there has been considerable research into the predictive power of these variables of subsequent outcomes and into measurement properties of subjective probabilities, very little is known about how individuals form and update the expectations they report. In this project we will use up to 60 waves of unique high-frequency longitudinal data on individuals' expectations that we have been collecting in the RAND American Life Panel (ALP). In the context of the ALP Financial Crisis Surveys we have queried respondents monthly about their expectations of losing their job, future stock market returns and gasoline prices, and we have asked them every quarter about their expectations about house prices, retirement, survival and out-of-pocket medical expenses. The overall objective of this proposed research is to establish the empirical foundations of how individuals form and update their expectations, recognizing that the expectation formation process is likely to vary by domain of outcome and by individuals. We will start out by studying the empirical properties of the high-frequency expectations data in cross-section and panel and what they imply for the basic features of individuals' expectation formation process in each domain. We willuse the insights to formulate models of expectation updating. We will estimate and test Bayesian updating models, as well as alternative models depending on the findings. Having a large number of observations for each individual we will estimate the expectation formation models at the individual-level and relate the resulting parameters to individual characteristics. We will further investigate the predictive power of individuals'subjective probabilities for economic decisions in panel data. RELEVANCE (See instructions): Studies have shown a strong link between socioeconomic status and health: How individuals make inter- temporal: decisions relating to their health and economic status under uncertainty will depend on their expectations about the future. Thus expectations will indirectly influence the evolution of health and economic positions. In this project we study individuals' expectation formation in several domains and how these influence economic decision making."

"9335750","Project Summary/Abstract Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a twisting condition of the spine and is the most common pediatric musculoskeletal disorder, affecting 3% of children worldwide. Children with AIS risk severe disfigurement, back pain, and pulmonary dysfunction later in life. Girls requiring treatment for AIS outnumber boys by more than five-fold, for reasons that are unknown. AIS is treated symptomatically rather than preventively because the underlying etiology is unknown. Hospital charges for AIS surpass one billion dollars annually in the U.S. and are rising significantly faster than for other pediatric procedures. Our overall purpose is to understand the biologic causes of AIS as a means to early diagnosis, prevention and non-invasive biologic treatment. Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is a complex genetic disease. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of common non-coding variants by our group and others have identified AIS-associated haplotypes, but the mechanistic basis of these associations remains to be defined. Furthermore these findings explain less than 5% of overall heritability due in part to the fact that the AIS exome has yet to be fully interrogated. Another barrier to understanding the pathogenesis of AIS in humans has been the lack of appropriate, genetically- defined animal models that are essential for defining spatiotemporal involvement in the disease. Finally the developmental regulation of postnatal spinal development generally, and the specific tissue of origin in AIS specifically, are poorly understood. To address these issues we have established an innovative collaborative approach combining unbiased gene discovery in humans, modeling and gene discovery in zebrafish, and genomic analysis of postnatal spine development. Specifically, the component activities of our proposed Program will synergize to yield the tools and fundamental knowledge that the field of AIS research has lacked, addressing the following goals: (1) We will define the genetic architecture conveying AIS susceptibility as identified in human populations; (2) We will develop the first genetically tractable vertebrate system for modeling AIS and studying the functional consequences of AIS mutations identified in humans; (3) We will define cis-and trans-regulation of AIS causal genes; (4) We will pilot a large-scale genomics platform to begin to characterize the molecular mechanisms controlling spinal development; (5) We will identify and characterize causal mutations in patients that may identify gene-based AIS subtypes; (6) By filling gaps in fundamental knowledge of the disease we will drive innovative efforts to develop new therapies for AIS. Our discoveries will spur the field toward much-needed hypothesis-driven research aimed at early molecular diagnosis, prevention and therapies. We also expect that these studies will enlighten other structural defects of humans."

"9384711","ABSTRACT The environment experienced by a developing fetus during gestation can have profound impacts on health outcomes throughout life. Infant growth is a significant risk factor for long-term chronic disease, particularly later childhood risk for obesity. A better understanding of the mechanisms through which the environment can program offspring obesity risk may help to improve risk assessment as well as provide opportunities for novel prevention approaches. These efforts may be most needed amongst populations experiencing the greatest health disparities, where adversities in the environment can be psychosocial, physical, and chemical in nature and where these exposures may be acting synergistically to impact health. Epigenetic mechanisms, due to their developmental plasticity but long-term functional role, have been posited as critical mediators of the environment?s impact on children?s health. Non-coding RNA, and particularly, microRNA (miRNA), represent one epigenetic mechanism that functions to control the stability of messenger RNA (mRNA) and the translation of proteins. There is growing evidence that miRNA can act as an inter-cellular signal to modulate various physiologic responses including metabolism and immune response. Due to these roles and their inherent ability to effect large numbers of target genes, miRNA represent fundamental regulators with the potential for wide-ranging consequences. We hypothesize that psychosocial, in addition to chemical stressors, in the maternal environment impact the pattern of expression of maternal and fetal miRNA and that the expression of these miRNA can impact critical newborn and early life health outcomes. We will examine this hypothesis using state-of-the-art technologies to characterize the full repertoire of miRNA in the Maternal and Developmental Risks from Environmental and Social Stressors (MADRES) pregnancy cohort, which focuses on low income Hispanic women in Los Angeles county. The MADRES cohort is collecting extensive data on actual objective stressors (negative life events, past trauma, neighborhood disorder) and the psychological response to stress (perceived stress and depression symptoms) along with socio-demographic information to comprehensively understand the extent of psychosocial stress experienced in this population. This proposal will measure miRNA in already collected peripheral blood samples 1st and 3rd trimesters, cord blood samples at birth, and will support the effort to collect placental samples for additional miRNA analysis. The main aims of the proposal will be to 1) examine how maternal psychosocial stress impacts the pattern of expression of miRNA in maternal blood during pregnancy, 2) delineate how maternal circulating miRNA impact newborn health outcomes including birth weight and small-for-gestational birth, and 3) examine the relationship between patterns of expression of miRNA in placental tissue and in cord blood to those in maternal serum. Results of this study will provide evidence for the role that miRNA play in mediating the effects of the prenatal environment on children?s health within a Hispanic population experiencing significant health disparities."

"9531642","Project Summary/Abstract RNA viruses are among the most rapidly evolving species. As a consequence, they readily escape host immunity and acquire resistance to antivirals. To combat these viruses we must utilize strategies that account for their evolutionary flexibility. We propose to study the molecular mechanisms of RNA virus evolution, in particular hepatitis C virus (HCV), to inform the development of `evolution proof' strategies for vaccine and antiviral drug design. To this end, we will examine how constraints on protein structure and function, in the form of epistasis, shape virus evolution. Our approach is to map networks of epistatically interacting residues within viral proteins through statistical analysis of coevolution and direct detection of epistasis using a state-of- the-art technique for population sequencing. With these maps, we will examine the flexibility of viral protein constraints and their impact on the capacity and direction of virus evolution. Furthermore, though ultra-deep sequencing of HCV populations treated with panels of antiviral drugs, we will define landscapes of antiviral resistance in order to systematically explore the contribution of epistasis to patterns of evolution. By examining a major source of protein constraint and the evolutionary mechanisms that facilitate bypass of those constraints, thus enabling viral adaptation, this study will provide new insights into key facets of the evolutionary process that may precipitate novel strategies for targeting rapidly evolving viral pathogens."
"9360109","Summary Progress from description to quantification is essential as a science matures. Yet numerical analysis of the elementary unit of brain circuitry?the individual neuron?continues to pose methodological challenges. Even the definition of a measurement yardstick (a metric) for the tree shape of a neuron remains an open research problem. Without such metrics, researchers cannot accurately classify neurons into cell types, an essential step toward understanding the circuit components and how they work together. Advanced methods from computational topology and geometry, which have only recently made their way from pure mathematics into data analysis, will be used to extract, characterize, and classify neuronal shapes in a way that elegantly incorporates the underlying dynamical electrophysiological properties. The first specific aim will apply new mathematical methods to define and compute metrics on the shapes of a wide variety of neurons. A computational topological analysis called ?persistence summaries? will be used to generate invariant representations of the neurons that can then be compared using different norms. An important strength of this method is that it works flexibly with arbitrary functions defined on the neurons, including purely structural ones (such as distance from the soma) or functions with electrophysiological meaning (such as electrotonic distance or propagation delays) and can therefore incorporate dynamics. A more advanced approach based on the Gromov-Hausdorff distance between metric spaces will be also explored. The metrics so generated will be used for classification and clustering, visualization of the space of neuronal shapes, and shape-based database search for neuronal reconstructions derived from light or electron microscopy. The second aim will use Morse theory to reconstruct individual neurons from light microscopic data, or skeletonize tracer injection data to summarize the structure of projection patterns. This approach retains shape information, which is lost when such data are characterized in a connectivity matrix. Further, these methods will be applied to construct consensus trees, which can be used as a summary of different reconstructions produced by different algorithms. The tools will be freely shared under a suitable open-source software license, and made available via plugins to widely used software platforms as well as web services to a community repository of neuronal morphologies. The team of researchers includes theorists, experimentalists, data scientists, and end users, all with extensive relevant experience. Apart from enabling the understanding of normal brain circuitry in terms of its component neurons, the proposed methods will also allow researchers to characterize changes in the shape of neurons in pathologically altered circuits, with applications to transgenic animal models of disease."
"9305125","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lung repair and regeneration is carried out by different stem/progenitor cell populations distributed along the pulmonary axis, including the bronchiolar club (Clara) cells, the alveolar type II epithelial cells, and bronchioalveolar stem cels (BASCs). These epithelial cell types also function on a daily basis to facilitate gas exchange and maintain tissue homeostasis. After injury, signals instruct the stem cell to produce progeny of the affected lineage, but the molecular characterization of these signals remains limited. We have developed a 3D co-culture assay to interrogate the regulation of BASC differentiation at the single cell level. Lung endothelial cells co-cultured with BASCs support bronchiolar and alveolar cell differentiation. Recently, we have shown that modulating the co-culture environment alters BASC differentiation outcomes. We found that BMP4 treatment activates the calcineurin-dependent transcription factor NFATc1 in endothelial cells to induce expression of Thrombospondin-1 (Tsp1), which was necessary and sufficient for alveolar lineage-specific differentiation. TSP1 was required for alveolar lung injury repair in vivo. Thus, we have uncovered a new signaling axis that operates between BASCs and endothelial cells to control differentiation and injury repair. We now seek to further characterize the BMP-NFATc1-TSP1 pathway up and down stream of TSP1, and to identify additional signals from lung endothelial cells that regulate BASC differentiation. In Aim 1, we will define the molecules in BASCs that regulate differentiation. We will examine expression of candidate TSP1 receptors in 3D co-cultures and alveolar lung injury samples. TSP1-dependent mediators of differentiation will be identified in an unbiased fashion by RNA-seq from in vivo Tsp1-manipulation and functionally tested in 3D co-cultures. In Aim 2, we will further delineate the secreted factors produced by lung endothelial cells that influence alveolar differentiation. Initially we will test the candidat BMP4-NFATc1 target R-spondin2, a Wnt pathway ligand that we recently found was induced in response to BMP4 treatment, in BASC/endothelial cell co-cultures. A lineage tracing approach will be used to test the R-spondin2 pathway in BASCs in vivo. We will also perform RNA-Seq coupled with NFATc1-ChIP-Seq to identify additional BMP4 targets in lung endothelial cells. Our experiments aim to define how a multipotent lung stem cell is instructed to produce lineage-specific progeny. This work will provide an opportunity for the discovery of mechanisms operating in the stem cell niche and therapeutic targets for enhanced lung injury repair in lung disease."
"9335754","Project Summary/Abstract Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) or late-onset scoliosis affects ~3% of the pediatric population, presenting with body curvature without overt structural defects of vertebral units. More severe AIS cases require surgery to correct the deformity and prevent co-morbidities including compromised pulmonary function. Despite this significant burden to the society, there is limited understanding of the genetic basis of AIS.  We propose to delineate the molecular genetics and generate animal models of AIS in zebrafish (Project 2) by synergistic interactions with human genetic (Project 1) and genomic (Project 3) studies. Having a well- annotated genome and plentiful, transparent progeny, zebrafish afford a powerful vertebrate model to study AIS by employing forward and reverse genetic approaches. Our preliminary genetic screen for chemically induced mutations has uncovered 31 recessive adult mutants with scoliotic features that define 25 complementation groups. Using massively parallel sequencing to analyze the genome of one scoliotic mutant, we identified a non-synonymous mutation in the kinesin family member 6 (kif6) gene. We propose to continue this productive screen to define genes required for normal spine development in zebrafish. We will identify the molecular nature of isolated mutants and characterize the defects at embryonic and tissue levels. The scoliotic zebrafish mutant loci will become candidates in human genetic (Project 1) and genomic analyses (Project 2). Towards validating candidate loci identified in human AIS patients and genomic studies, we will leverage the gene targeting and editing methods we recently helped to improve, to engineer null mutations and/or humanized non-synonymous mutations in zebrafish.  By combining the complementary expertise of the participating research groups, advances in human genetics and genomics with the strengths and methodological innovations in the zebrafish model, this program will provide the first atlas of genes critical to proper spine development in general and to AIS specifically. We will also create tissue bank, genomic databases and generate animal models that will altogether open new avenues to understand, diagnose and eventually prevent or treat AIS."

"9370858","PROJECT SUMMARY Perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComa) are a rare subset of soft tissue sarcomas. PEComas arise most commonly at visceral (especially gastrointestinal and uterine), retroperitoneal, and abdominopelvic sites. Most PEComa lesions are benign and slow-progressing, however, a small subset of them are malignant PEComas, with an aggressive clinical course including distant metastases and ultimate death. Malignant PEComa is extremely rare, with an estimated incidence of 0.12- 0.24/1,000,000 or approximately 42-84 new patients per year, and an estimated prevalence of 0.22- 0.48/1,000,000 or approximately 77-168 patients in the United States. Currently, no effective medical treatment has been prospectively investigated or approved for advanced malignant PEComa, including metastatic or locally advanced disease where surgery is not an option. The prognosis for these patients is poor, with an estimated median survival of 12-17 months. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have not demonstrated significant clinical benefit. Therefore, a significant unmet need exists for effective therapies to treat this aggressive and life-threatening disease. The cytosolic kinase mTOR plays a major role in cell survival and proliferation. Limited case studies suggest that the mTOR pathway is frequently deregulated in sporadic malignant PEComa (mostly with mutation or loss of TSC2), making mTOR inhibition a promising therapeutic strategy. Rapamycin blocks mTORC1 signaling, resulting in decreased protein translation and G1 cell cycle arrest. In some case studies, patients with PEComa benefited from treatment with mTOR inhibitors, including oral rapamycin. Oral mTOR inhibitors have low and highly variable oral bioavailability, poor solubility, and dose-limiting GI toxicities and require therapeutic monitoring of blood levels to ensure adequate dosing. A novel albumin-bound nanoparticle rapamycin (sirolimus) was developed (nab-rapamycin, ABI-009; originally by Abraxis Bioscience/Celgene Corporation and licensed to AADi, LLC). In a phase 1 clinical study, ABI-009 administered intravenously showed a promising safety despite high dose with evidence of responses and stable disease in a variety of solid tumors. Albumin bound drugs have shown enhanced tumor penetration, and ABI-009 shows significantly improved activity in animal models at equal dose and superior pharmacological properties with significantly higher Cmax and AUC without compromising safety as compared to the available mTOR inhibitors. AADi, LLC, a small start-up company and applicant for this grant, has filed IND 125,669 (submitted Jul 13, 2015 and approved Aug 13, 2015) to conduct a single arm phase 2 clinical study (NCT02494570) to assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous ABI-009 for advanced (locally advanced and metastatic) malignant PEComa. There are no other ongoing trials for this patient population. Thirty-five patients will be enrolled and the primary endpoint will be ORR; the secondary endpoints will be duration of response (DOR), PFS rate at 6 months, PFS, OS, and safety/tolerability. PK/PD and tumor biomarkers will be analyzed as correlative and translational components to determine mechanisms of tumor response and resistance. In agreement with the FDA (DOP2) in a pre-IND meeting, this single-arm study design and statistical considerations may be sufficient to support a marketing application for ABI-009 in advanced PEComa [Appendix - Attachment 2: AADi-FDA Pre-IND Meeting Minutes 7/7/2015] if the primary endpoint of ORR is of sufficient magnitude and duration. As of the date of this grant resubmission, all 9 of the planned US clinical sites have been IRB approved and activated. From April 2016 to October 2016 (date of the resubmission), 7 patients have been enrolled in the study. This program represents a unique opportunity to develop and get approval of a new drug with potentially improved efficacy and safety over existing therapies, for an extremely rare disease and patient population for which there are no approved therapies."
"9452665","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Exposure of young children to general anesthesia (GA) is common in medicine; however, emerging data suggest that early postnatal exposure to GA may be detrimental to brain development, resulting in long- term cognitive impairments. Older literature also suggested that in utero exposure of rodents to GA causes cognitive impairments in the first- as well as the second-generation offspring never exposed to GA. Thus, we must consider the general hypothesis that transient exposure to GA during critical stages of brain development causes epigenetic changes in chromatin and DNA with deleterious effects on transcription of target genes crucial for proper synapse formation and cognitive development. Our long-term goals are to understand how GA modulates transcriptional machinery of developing neurons and to establish any links between GA-induced epigenetic modulations and long-term memory deficit. The rationale is that this understanding will enable pharmacological targeting of critical steps in gene transcription aimed to prevent GA-induced impairment of synaptogenesis and memory/learning deficits. We will use in vivo and in vitro rat models of GA-induced developmental neurotoxicity to address the specific hypothesis that GA decreases histone acetylase (HAT) activity of cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB) Binding Protein (CBP) and thereby reduces transcription of target genes that regulate the development of neuronal morphology, function and long-term memory. Specific Aim #1: Determine how GA alters histone acetylation and thereby the activity of a set of transcription factors (CREB, c-FOS) that target genes contributing to long-term memory storage and consolidation (e.g. BDNF, MECP2, Cdk-5). Preliminary data suggest that GA significantly decreases CBP content and global histone 3 (H3) acetylation, the epigenetic modulations that inhibit transcriptional activation. We will examine GA effects on total HAT and on histone deacetylase (HDAC) activities via ELISA and on specific HAT activity of CBP after immunoprecipitation; and follow acetylation at specific histone sites with antibodies to H3K14, H2BK12 and H4K8. Expression and phosphorylation of cFos and CREB will be assessed, and activation of target genes will be assayed via DNA methylation, targeted assessment of histone acetylation in their promoters, and mRNA production. The dependence of GA-induced changes in histone acetylation will be assessed by determining whether isoform-specific HDAC inhibitors or isoform-specific HDAC siRNA can reverse them. Specific Aim #2: Use specific HDAC inhibitors or HDAC siRNA to determine whether GA- induced epigenetic changes in histone acetylation and transcriptional regulation of CREB, c-FOS, and target genes are linked to GA-induced impairment of neuronal morphology, dendritic arborization, synapse formation, synaptic plasticity and memory development. We will attempt to mimic the GA effect in neuronal cultures and slices by using CBP siRNA to impair its HAT and transcriptional activity and CREB siRNA to impair CBP:CREB interaction."
"9312971","The objectives of the Protein Localization, Identification and Folding (PLIF) Core is to connect investigators to imaging techniques, particularly confocal and electron microscopy, highly specialized mass spectrometry and the new area of protein folding as related to digestive diseases. This Core has evolved since the origin of the GI Center in 1986, when it was a morphology core, to one encompassing newer and more sophisticated techniques of protein identification and localization. In the last funding period that began in 2010, the Core has been known as the Protein Identification and Localization Core. The new proposed PLIF Core has added a more robust and state-of-the-art mass spectrometry facility that is part of an institutionally funded Protein Folding Diseases Initiative at the University of Michigan. Given that multiple GI diseases, including hepatitis, inflammatory bowel diseases and pancreatitis, involve abnormalities of protein folding resulting in endoplasmic reticulum and other organelle stress, this adds another new dimension to the Core and takes advantage of significant institutional investments. The specific aims of the PLIF Core are: (1) Provide state of the art protein localization and identification facilities. Core programs include: Imaging, Proteomics and Protein Folding Diseases Initiative resources; (2) Ensure delivery of high quality services and products and provide technical oversight of all PLIF services; and (3) Train and educate members, associate members and pilot feasibility recipients in the application and use of protein identification techniques for the study of digestive and liver diseases. The most popular Core service is access to well-maintained confocal microscopes and software for image processing and 3-D image reconstruction. Other broadly used services include the evaluation of fine structure by electron microscopy and the identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications by mass spectrometry both of which are carried out by expert Core personnel. Other added aspects are an Aperio AT2 scanner and software for image analysis of stained tissue sections, and a laser capture microdissection system. The Core is directed by Drs. Asma Nusrat and Bishr Omary, two experienced and established investigators with extensive expertise in the services provided by the Core. During the current cycle of the grant, the Protein Identification and Localization Core services were used by 76% of Center members; and supported 116 publications with primary PLIF Core usage, of which 48 were collaborative publications among two or more Center members. We anticipate a similar fraction of Center members, including pilot awardees, to make use of the expanded PLIF Core. We also expect to effectively partner with the other Cores of the Center and with other NIH-supported centers, and to continue to provide state-of-the-art and efficient services and promote collaborations to synergistically advance GI research and discoveries."
"9357512","Summary: Data Core   The Data Core is designed to support the access, collection, encoding, decoding, transmission, processing, storage, analysis, display, and distribution of data informing Aging in Place (AiP) research and facilitating subsequent interventions based on those data. The Data Core works closely in concert with the Resource Core to ensure functionality of the entire CART system. The Data Core follows the overarching framework of data acquired in the service of capturing vital life domains that best inform AiP. In this framework, the potential for data to be derived across three interacting major technology domains (Monitoring/Measurement (person/environment); Diagnosis or Screening; and Treatment/Intervention (compensation, prevention, enhancement) needs to be maintained. With these goals in mind, the Data Core aims are to:  1. Establish and maintain a complete CART data system including connected devices and sensors,  server(s), software, security, backup and recovery and updating capacities. This aim will be achieved  by working very closely with the Resource Core which has leading responsibility for the `front-end',  home-based technologies and infrastructure deployment.  2. Create and curate data standards and metrics encompassing electronics, sensors, algorithms,  clinical measures, and security.  3. Establish and maintain a secure, yet readily available research Data Repository that includes  person-level records of all captured data, as well as the technical specifications, variable descriptions  (data dictionary) and manuals for others to use and build on.  4. Provide data analytics that incorporates multi-domain sensor data, self-report, health records  and other research related data and connect these data to clinical outcomes or outcomes  specific to end-user's hypotheses and needs. In this aim, the Data Core will be responsible for  providing statistical analyses for data generated during the development cycles as well as for the  Demonstration Project (DP). Statistical modeling approaches including programs developed or  applied will be shared with the scientific community in a ?Repository of Analytical Approaches? to further  promote data usage and facilitate advancement of analytical approaches.  5. Widely share and disseminate data using a secure, password-protected system compliant with  applicable federal data-security standards (including VA and HIPPA) and local requirements. The Data  Core will be organized to facilitate analysis by many users serving as a CART data, protocols and  software clearinghouse linking to other big data and related repository efforts (e.g., Mobile Data to  Knowledge (MD2K), NACDA) and the wider research community."

"9353809","TR&D 1  Quantitative MRS of the brain at 3T and 7T  Principal investigators: Peter B. Barker, D.Phil., Professor of Radiology and Oncology  Richard Edden, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Radiology SUMMARY Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) offers a unique, non-invasive way of studying human brain metabolism and neurochemistry in vivo. Such measurements offer insights into the pathophysiology of human disease, the study of brain function, as well as diagnostic and prognostic information in clinical practice. The needs for new and improved MRS technology are driven by multiple collaborative projects, ranging from the developing brain (i.e. pediatric applications such Autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) to neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer's disease (AD), Huntington's disease), as well as brain tumors, HIV infection, and schizophrenia. The use of high magnetic field strengths such as 7 Tesla is particularly beneficial for MRS; aim 1 of this TR&D will therefore be focused on the development of quantitative methods for spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) at 7T, with an emphasis on methods for rapid, high-resolution metabolite mapping with extended brain coverage. We will focus on mapping of glutamate in the brain using MRSI, and compare the results with those obtained from TR&D2 using novel exchange transfer imaging (ETI) techniques. In recent years, there has been much interest in the measurement of the primary inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA, in the human brain; this and other metabolites (such as glutathione and the oncometabolite 2-hydroxygltarate) are best measured at 3 Tesla using spectral-editing techniques. Aim 2 of this proposal will focus on quantitative spectral-editing methods, with a particular emphasis of the development of multi-voxel editing methods. Finally, aim 3 will develop quantitative MRS and MRSI methods and post-processing software; the tools developed will be made available for dissemination to the scientific community."
"9385399","Project Summary/Abstract The mission of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) is to ?advance hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for patients with rare and difficult to treat blood diseases through high- quality multi-center clinical trials by evaluating new ways to improve traditional HCT approaches or by advancing HCT therapy through the use of either novel ex vivo manipulated cell products or genetically- modified cells.? Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) is an NCl-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center with one of the largest HCT programs in the country. The HCT program at MSK is FACT-accredited program and divided into pediatric and adult services. MSK has been a Core Member of the BMT CTN since its inception and Dr. Perales (Deputy Service Chief, grant PI), Dr. Giralt (Adult BMT Service Chief, former PI) as well as all members of the Adult BMT Service consider participation in the BMT CTN an integral part of their mission. In this grant, we detail our ongoing commitment to the success of the Network through the formation of an oversight structure that includes a BMT CTN MSK Executive Committee, a BMT CTN Protocol Management Team, and a BMT CTN Internal Advisory Board. These three administrative structures leverage not only the senior leadership of the clinical services in the Division of Hematologic Oncology, but also some of MSK's most outstanding scientists and investigators. We are also committed to continue to provide leadership to the Network with the next generation of innovative trials and correlative studies. In particular, we propose a multicenter randomized phase II trial to determine the safety and efficacy of post-HCT administration of CD19 targeted chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells in patients undergoing high-dose therapy followed by autologous HCT (HDT-AHCT) for relapsed/refractory (rel/ref) DLBCL. We propose 3 specific aims: (1) Demonstrate that MSK has the clinical and translational expertise, and capabilities in novel cell therapies, genetically-modified cells, and early phase trials to fulfill the obligations of a BMT CTN Core Clinical Center that will move forward the BMT CTN mission and goals; (2) Complete a phase II study in which rel/ref DLBCL patients will receive 3 monthly infusions of CD19 CAR T cells after HDT-AHCT. In Arm 1, the 1st infusion will be day +3 after HCT, with later infusions on days +30 and +60. In Arm 2, the 1st infusion will be day +10, with later infusions on the same Arm 1 schedule. The primary endpoint will be PFS at a 1-year. A pick-the-winner design will be used for the study; (3) Assess quantitative persistence and qualitative function of CAR T cells and correlate to: serum cytokine profiles, B cell aplasia, and clinical outcomes. This research is significant as it proposes a novel treatment paradigm in patients with relapsed DLBCL resistant to standard-dose 2nd-line chemotherapy, who typically would have long-term EFS with HDT-AHCT of only 10-15%. The proposed study is highly relevant to the BMT CTN, since it presents an innovative cell therapy, u s i n g genetically modified cells to improve outcomes in patients with advanced lymphoid malignancies, including rel/ref DLBCL."
"9359395","Project Summary  The Melanoma and Cutaneous Malignancies Program is a multidisciplinary Research Program that has been  supported by the NCI CCSG since 1978. It provides the organizational structure and research forum for the  efficient conduct of collaborative basic, clinical, and epidemiologic research in melanoma, basal and squamous  cell carcinoma, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Lynn Schuchter, MD has been Program Leader since 2007,  after being an active member since 1989. John Seykora, MD, PhD was appointed Co-Leader in 2014 given the  expansion of the Program into non-melanoma skin cancers. Members have a high degree of collaboration with  other Research Programs and extramural investigators. The primary goal of the Program is to improve survival  and quality of life for patients with melanoma, non-melanoma skin cancers and CTCL through basic,  translational, and clinical epidemiological research. Three highly translational thematic areas of scientific focus  include: epidemiology and risk assessment; the biology of cutaneous malignancies; and experimental  therapeutics, including both targeted and immunotherapeutic approaches. The cohesiveness of the Program is  maintained through several collaborative mechanisms (monthly research meetings, weekly tumor boards,  monthly research in progress meetings, a yearly retreat sponsored by the Cancer Center) and NCI-funded  multi-investigator research grants. The Program's 26 members are drawn from 11 departments from Penn's  Perelman School of Medicine and two departments from The Wistar Institute. Critically important resources  have been developed by Program members, and are supported by the Cancer Center, which have fostered the  highly productive, translational research that distinguishes this Program. The resources include a  comprehensive melanoma database; a melanoma pathology archive, from which investigators can access  annotated pathology slides and blocks (normal skin and lesions) of patients seen as far back as 30 years ago;  and a large biorepository of thousands of collected blood and tumor samples from patients with cutaneous  lymphoma. During the project period, the Program has been remarkably productive with numerous  investigator-initiated clinical trials and publications in high impact journals including New England Journal of  Medicine, Journal of Clinical Oncology, Cell, and Journal of Clinical Investigation. The success of these efforts  is reflected in the award of an NCI Skin Cancer SPORE and additional grants in laboratory-based translational  and population science research, including two NCI P01 grants to support innovative clinical/translational  research. In total, members have $4.1M in research funding (annual direct costs) of which $2.3M is peer-  reviewed and $1.5 is from the NCI. During the project period, members published 373 cancer-related  publications, of which 22% were intra-Programmatic, 30% were inter-Programmatic and 58% were multi-  institutional."
"9353810","TR&D 2. Quantitative multi-contrast MRI at 3T and 7T.  Principal investigators:  Peter C.M. van Zijl, Professor of Radiology Hanzhang Lu, Associate Professor of Radiology SUMMARY The discovery of tissue biomarkers that can provide early and more specific information regarding physiological or metabolic changes can be seen as the holy grail of clinical imaging. The availability of such biomarkers is one of the main issues that we are continuously being inquired about by our collaborative projects (CPs), which study such topics as autism spectum disorder (ASD), pediatric brain development, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's Disease (AD), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Huntington's Disease (HD), Schizophrenia (SCZ), and brain tumors. Our overall goal is therefore to develop MRI methodologies at 3T and 7T that can provide the quantitative biomarkers needed by our CPs. Towards this goal, AIM 1 is focused on the development of exchange transfer imaging (ETI) of the brain. Based originally on chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST) MRI, which uses pulse sequences similar to conventional magnetization transfer MRI, ETI is broader as it allows the assessment of tissue metabolites that contain exchangeable protons using not only radiofrequency saturation, but instead pulsed excitation sequences that can be used to edit out specific tissue components based on their exchange rate or transverse relaxation time. In addition, we will exploit multi-transmit capabilities of the scanner to avoid amplifier duty cycle limitations on the human scanners. In AIM 2, we will develop methods to determine quantitative magnetic susceptibilities of tissue independent of the orientation of the brain. The purpose of Aim 3 is to design technology that allows assessment of both relative (changes in) and absolute arterial and arteriolar cerebral blood volume (CBVa), venous cerebral blood volume (CBVv), and cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen metabolism (CMRO2)."
"9489835","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Project Summary RNA regulatory networks in motor neuron development and function Post-transcriptional regulation at the RNA level, such as alternative splicing, plays a critical role in generating of the cellular and functional complexityof mammalian nerve cells during neuronal development. This regulation is dictated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) interacting with their target transcripts, thereby profoundly affecting the output of the transcriptome. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate the organizational principles of these RNA regulatory networks and their functional impact on neuronal development at the systems level. Despite very significant progress made over the past few years, current efforts to dissect neuronal RNA regulatory networks are facing two major challenges: i) cellular heterogeneity of the brain tissue used as a major source of material for genomic and biochemical analysis of regulatory networks, and ii) difficulty and inefficiency of simultaneous perturbation of multiple regulators important for functional evaluation of the discovered networks. Both challenges are reflected in studies of the Rbfox RBP family, in which the three functionally redundant members Rbfox1 (A2bp1), Rbfox2 (Rbm9) and Rbfox3 (NeuN) are preferentially expressed in many types post-mitotic neurons and are believed to regulate a large set of important neuronal transcripts. So far, only a small number of Rbfox target transcripts have been validated in physiological contexts and the function of Rbfox proteins or their targets in specific neuronal cell types is poorly understood. In this proposal, we will particularly focus on motor neurons, which are the nerve cells required for muscle contraction and movement and are lost in several fatal neurodegenerative diseases. We hypothesize that a concerted action of Rbfox proteins is critical for motor neuron development and function. To test this hypothesis, we will employ, in parallel, an in vitro but physiologically relevant stem cell differentiation system and an in vivo mouse model, in which various combinations of Rbfox family members are depleted in motor neurons as a means of elucidating their cell type-specific function at the molecular and cellular levels. The target networks directly regulated by different Rbfox family members will be defined by comparative analysis of genome-wide, high-resolution profiling of cell type-specific transcriptomes, unbiased maps of protein-RNA interactions, and integrative modeling of multiple modalities of data generated by these genomic and biochemical assays. Functional validation of a select subset of Rbfox targets will be performed to establish the link between splice variants and specific aspects of neuronal developments. Results from our studies will not only provide novel insights into the function of neuronal RBPs in motor neuron biology and the underlying molecular mechanisms, but also have the potential to expand our understanding in the consequence of disrupted RNA metabolism in motor neuron diseases."
"9345285","During the last three decades, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using the endogenous blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect for contrast has increased our understanding of the healthy and the diseased brain. While fMRI continues to evolve, its full potential for neuroscience research and clinical translation will not be achieved without greatly improved significance at the individual subject/patient level (as opposed to group comparison) and accuracy/repeatability across sessions, sites, platforms, and time. Dramatic improvements in fMRI are required in order to provide robust functional diagnostic information for individual subjects/patients and to allow physicians to take full advantage of emerging invasive and non-invasive neuromodulation therapies. The aims of this proposal will accelerate deployment of next generation functional neuroimaging (NGFN) tools for greatly improved large-scale whole brain recording with significance at the level of an individual subject, dramatically reduced instrumental noise and without the current confounds of auditory, vibration, and gradient stimulation. This project will therefore have a significant impact on functional imaging and clinical translation and will, with further development, potentially lead to direct (neural current dipole) non-invasive recording of neuronal activity."
"9315882","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) is the intentional combination of minimally invasive surgical grafting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) coronary artery using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of non-LAD coronary stenoses. HCR procedures are being adopted by clinicians nationwide, in an effort to reduce morbidity, mortality, recovery time, repeat re-interventions, and the costs of revascularization for patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) involving the LAD and/or left main coronary arteries. To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial to establish whether HCR achieves these results, and increasing adoption of HCR is proceeding without a solid evidence base. The proposed trial is designed to fill this knowledge gap and provide an evidence base for clinical practice. We propose a pragmatic, large-scale clinical trial that evaluates the effectiveness and safety of HCR compared to multi-vessel PCI. The trial will enroll 2354 patients with multi-vessel CAD involving the LAD distribution and a clinical indication for revascularization, who are eligible for both HCR and multi-vessel PCI with drug eluting stents. The primary outcome will be occurrence of MACCE, defined as all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization over a minimum of 5 year follow-up after randomization. A vanguard phase will be conducted over the first year of the trial to establish feasibility of enrollment and data completeness of centralized collection of MACCE events. The innovative design of the trial combines collection and adjudication of minimal trial-specific data with national registry data (STS and NCDR), resulting in a streamlined and very cost-effective trial. A previous NIH-funded observational study (RC1 HL100951-01, Principal Investigators, J. Puskas, D. Ascheim), informing the design of this trial, demonstrated that 10-15% of patients with CAD are anatomically eligible for HCR and confirmed that equipoise exists among cardiologists and surgeons to randomize such patients. To conduct this trial, we have assembled a Hybrid Trial Network of 49 selected clinical sites experienced in multi-vessel PCI, minimally invasive LIMA-LAD grafting, and HCR. Co-Investigators from cardiology and cardiac surgery have signed Letters of Collaboration from all sites. In the past two years the Hybrid Network sites have performed >6500 CABG procedures and approximately 15,000 multi-vessel PCI procedures for patients with suitable coronary anatomy, and, therefore, have a large volume of patients eligible for HCR. The results of the Hybrid Trial could fundamentally change management of patients with CAD, the number one cause of death in the United States. This trial, which will support numerous clinical centers across the country and the DCC and CCC, will provide evidence to guide and improve treatment decisions and optimize the utilization of health care resources for this growing patient population."
"9359388","Project Summary  Clinical Protocol and Data Management (CPDM) is the administrative home for all of the units that support  clinical research at the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC), providing essential support for and monitoring of all  clinical research conducted in the ACC regardless of the type of intervention or sponsor. The CPDM, in  collaboration with ACC Leadership, creates, directs and enforces the operational standards (policies) and  expectations for the conduct of all clinical research within the ACC. The CPDM scope is of necessity broad,  encompassing development and updating of policies and procedures, education and training, supervision of  data managers and research nurses, and oversight over all of the specialty clinical research units within our  Center. The CPDM manages our centralized Clinical Trials Management System (CTMS), Velos, organizes  and performs quality assurance and QC/monitoring of clinical trials across the center, and directly manages the  complex, ongoing and recurring activities of our mandatory clinical research review committees. Key units  supported by the CPDM are the Department of Compliance and Monitoring (DOCM), the Protocol Review and  Monitoring System (PRMS, known as the Clinical Trials Scientific Review and Monitoring Committee  [CTSRMC]), the Data and Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC), and the Clinical Research Unit (CRU).  While CPDM provides the administrative support for PRMS and DSMC, it is vital to note that these are, by  design, distinct entities. PRMS is described elsewhere in this renewal. The inclusion of Women and  Minorities in clinical trials is a central focus of ACC Leadership and clinical investigators as a component of  our commitment to addressing the cancer burden in minority and underserved populations. During the current  award period, the ACC implemented several initiatives aimed at reducing disparities in cancer incidence and  mortality in minorities, including completion of quality improvement training to further increase the diversity of  the patients on cancer clinical trials at ACC, establishment of additional key partnerships with community  organizations to increase educational efforts and community outreach, creation of cancer screening navigation  programs that increase patient engagement and improve access to and completion of cancer screening tests,  and recruitment of a cadre of patient navigators for common diseases in our catchment area affecting  minorities, including lung, colorectal and breast cancer, in order to assist patients from all backgrounds in  getting into our health care system and using it effectively. Children with cancer have traditionally had a very  high participation rate in clinical research studies with the field of pediatric oncology often at the forefront of  cancer clinical research. The ACC Pediatric Oncology Program has played a central role locally and nationally  in improving our understanding of the biology of childhood cancers through the collection and study of human  tumor specimens, and in advancing our knowledge of optimal treatments by conducting clinical trials and  playing a very notable leadership role in national pediatric cooperative group and clinical research consortia."
"9385606","The long term goal of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trial Network (BMT CTN) is to generate efficacy and safety data from multicenter Phase II and III trials, and advance the science and technology of immune and hematopoietic cellular therapies for the cure of blood disorders. The Moffitt Cancer Center has in place all the infrastructures for promoting and delivering immune and hematopoietic cellular therapies, with a robust Immunology Working Group properly positioned to design solutions, a GMP-compliant Cellular Therapy Facility for cell manufacturing and quality control, the BMT and the Immune and Cellular Therapy services to deliver established and experimental cellular therapies to patients with nonmalignant blood disorders, hematological malignancies and solid tumors. Our team is eager to contributing moving the field forward by collaborating with the BMT CTN for all the development steps of innovative cellular therapies. Specific Aim 1 is to collaborate with the BMT CTN in the design and conduct of multicenter studies and the dissemination of the results. Novel ideas start from teams of investigators at a single center, but significant advances in medical care require multicenter phase III randomized trials. Our team brings expertise in cellular immunotherapy, GVHD immunobiology, and behavioral studies. Moffitt Cancer Center has a fully established clinical and translational research program with a growing infrastructure to facilitate over 40 cellular therapy treatments and over 400 HSCT per year, and will continue to make BMT CTN trials available to patients in our institution. We bring unique science, clinical trial design experience, clinical expertise and volume, and our commitment to aggressively pursue these advances through the highly valuable BMT CTN network. Specific Aim 2 is to test the efficacy of ustekinumab for GVHD prophylaxis in a phase III multicenter trial by the BMT CTN. The BMT research program has recognized that Th17 are important effectors in GVHD alongside Th1 cells both in rodents and human transplants, and that the p40 subunit shared with IL-12 and IL-23 is relevant to GVHD pathogenesis. We present preliminary data from a placebo-controlled proof-of-principle clinical trial that ustekinumab (StelaraTM), an antibody against the human p40, polarizes T cells to Th2 while dampening Th1 and Th17 after allogenic HSCT. The clinical data also suggest that ustekinumab has the potential for mitigating both acute and chronic GVHD, and improving survival without disrupting graft-vs-leukemia responses. Our proposed concept for a definitive multicenter trial addresses the significant unmet need to prevent acute and chronic GVHD, and positive results will exert a sustained, powerful influence on the future clinical research in GVHD prevention and expand utilization of allogeneic HSCT."

"9324212","Abstract The adult human intestine is over 20 feet long and has a functional absorptive surface area of nearly 2,000 square feet. Three major processes (which take place prior to birth) establish the effective absorptive surface required to sustain life: a) intestinal lengthening; b) generation of villi and c) apical surface polarization. The molecular processes underlying these attributes are important clinically and therapeutically, but are poorly understood. Work in the last project period established a model of intestinal growth, characterized by rapid proliferation, low apoptosis and directional dispersion of cells along the anterior/posterior (A/P) axis. Analysis of Wnt5a null intestines (a short bowel model) revealed defects in extension of radial filopodia during interkinetic nuclear migration, increased apoptosis, reduced pJNK activity, altered Golgi positioning and reduced Filamin A. Aim 1 is driven by the hypothesis that a Wnt5a-Ror2-Filamin A pathway controls radial filopodial extension, insuring cell survival in the epithelium; this is important for proper lengthening. This pathway will be explored using genetic tools and intestinal explant cultures.  At E14.5, subepithelial mesenchymal clusters form, causing overlying epithelial cells to change shape. Epithelial cells between clusters activate Cd44v6; rounded mitotic cells in these regions appear to drive a process of rapid invagination that determines the villus domains. The hypothesis driving Aim 2 is that Epithelial invagination defines the apical surfaces of the first villi; this process is driven by patterned mesenchymal clusters and aided by mechanical forces and specialized cell divisions. The role of intra-epithelial pressure and the need for mitotic progression and oriented cell division will be examined; the basis for impeded invagination in Ezrin-/- mice will be investigated.  Finally, the cellular and molecular aspects of apical surface polarization and maturation will be studied in the early human endoderm using a new in vitro model system. The hypothesis underlying Aim 3 is: Human congenital short bowel caused by mutations in FLNA and CLMP result in improper apical polarization. The molecular sequence of polarization will be established in cultures of differentiating CDX2 cells and effects of short bowel mutations on that sequence will be determined.  By focusing on the cell biology underlying the developmental biology of the early intestine, these studies are unveiling key processes that establish the template for generation of the apical absorptive surface. Mathematical modeling of the data is revealing which parameters are most critical over developmental time."

DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Duke University Division of Gastroenterology has been engaged in the training of clinicians and scientists in gastroenterology and hepatology since 1965. The philosophy has been to generate research questions from challenges that emerge in the care of patients through an environment that facilitates the relationships of clinicians and scientists. In the last decade, our program has been particularly successful in the placement of graduates into academic positions. Our goal is to maintain this history of productivity by creating an environment that facilitates the development of young investigators capable of pursuing successful research careers. With this competing renewal, Dr. Rodger Liddle and Dr. Andrew Muir have assumed the leadership as Co-Directors. In collaboration with the former Director and Executive Committee, the team has implemented a number of substantial enhancements to the experience of our trainees. The training program has been reorganized into two tracks with a basic/translational track led by Dr. Liddle and a clinical research track led by Dr. Muir. We have also reduced the number of faculty to those focused in gastroenterology or hepatology research. Although collaborations will continue to be sought across Duke and with neighboring universities, our goal is to strengthen the bonds of the gastroenterology and hepatology researchers to enhance the community environment of the research training program. Specific examples of other changes include: 1) reorganization of mentoring teams with the addition of a career mentor and broader representation among basic and clinical researchers; 2) application of the mentoring program design to junior faculty; 3) expansion of the junior preceptor program; 4) expansion of the recruitment process to diversify the applicant pool; 5) development of training for PhD fellows to gain clinical experience and develop working relationships with clinicians and clinical researchers; 6) a new Visiting Scholar Program funded by the Division of Gastroenterology to expose trainees to leading researchers; 7) an annual Duke GI Research Symposium with awards for the best fellow presentations; 8) development of a science culture and accountability plan to foster an environment where scientific integrity is the highest priority; 9) formation of a new External Advisory Committee. Th goal of this program is to continue training talented researchers and to build on the Duke environment that will ensure our postdoctoral fellows develop into highly successful, innovative, independent investigators."
"9394573","Problem. Neurological disease and injury are major causes of disability, reflecting the need for more effective interventions. Additionally, accounting for the aging Veteran population, there is a projected 20% increase in disability for individuals age 85 and older, within the next 10 years. For example, approximately 6,000 VA annual admissions are for stroke, and at least 50% have serious, long term disability. Equally compelling statistics exist for traumatic brain injury (TBI) and other neurological diseases and injury.  Research Activities and Overarching Goals. In strong support of the VHA Vision 2020 Strategic Plan and the RR&D mission, Dr. Daly is Director of the VA BRRC, whose mission is as follows: Discover mechanisms of pathology and impairment presenting obstacles to neural function, and generate innovative treatments to potentiate neural plasticity and neural network reorganization that will substantially improve motor, cognitive, and emotion function affected by neurologic disease or injury, sufficient to enhance quality of life and return to society and life role participation. To that end, Dr. Daly?s empowering BRRC leadership has attracted an interdisciplinary critical mass of electrical and biomedical engineers, biomechanists, neurologists, physical and occupational therapists, experimental and clinical neuropsychologists, exercise and neuromuscular physiologists, neuroscientists, and chemical and biophysicists. Significant discoveries have included information regarding the pathologies underlying neural dysfunction and innovative methods for restoring neural control of motor, cognitive, and emotion function for those with TBI, stroke, Parkinson?s disease, spinal cord injury, and multiple sclerosis.  Supporting the VHA Mission and goals, and in addition to her BRRC leadership, Dr. Daly directs the Cognitive and Motor Learning Research Program, whose mission is to identify, engage, and restore the neural control that drives recovery of motor function in stroke survivors. Goals of currently ongoing studies are as follows:  1. Identify brain pattern changes that drive motor recovery.  2. Generate novel treatment methods that more accurately target pathology and impairment.  3. Apply motor learning principles that engage brain plasticity mechanisms allowing for productive practice  of progressively more normal coordinated gait and upper limb function.  4. Generate and test treatment modules for gait components and upper limb function components.  5. Test gait and upper limb coordination treatment protocols in the clinical environment.  Discoveries include the following: development and successful testing of a gait coordination training protocol that is clinically and statistically effective in chronic moderately impaired stroke survivors; successful feasibility pilot testing of a unique two-year care program for gait coordination, mobility, and fitness in stroke survivors; brain activation changes identified that drive upper limb motor recovery; development and successful testing of an upper limb function training protocol that is clinically and statistically effective in chronic moderately/severely impaired stroke survivors; necessary essential content of coordination training protocols includes long-duration, intensive coordination practice of finely incremental progression through a difficulty hierarchy."
"9357586","Project Summary Calcium imaging methods allow us to record the simultaneous activity of many neurons with single-cell resolution; these methods are therefore a critical enabling tool for the BRAIN initiative and in neuroscience more broadly. These experiments produce enormous 2D or 3D video datasets ? in some cases with data rates measured in terabytes/hour - and the analysis of this ?big data? currently represents a major bottleneck on scientific progress in this field. This project develops powerful new analysis methods for eliminating this bottleneck, opening up new scientific questions and applications that can be attacked with these new tools. The methods under development simultaneously identify the locations of the imaged neurons, resolve spatially overlapping neuronal shapes, and provide denoised estimates of the activity of each neuron, with minimal manual parameter tuning. The new methods quantitatively and qualitatively improve upon the state of the art in both simulated data and in a wide variety of real data applications, leading to the recovery of useful signals from many more neurons than otherwise possible. At the same time, the methods are computationally scalable and modular, enabling a healthy user and development community. Finally, the methods are extensible: they are founded on well-defined probabilistic modeling and convex optimization principles, enabling a range of extensions to address important new scientific problems. Specific aims of the project include a number of critical subprojects focused on: first, scaling up these methods to handle very large data sets, as computationally efficiently as possible, to enable closed-loop, real-time experiments; and second, strengthening the methods to obtain statistically optimal solutions, in order to extract as much information from the data as possible, with the highest possible spatiotemporal resolution, enabling the development of novel integrated computational imaging methods. In parallel, this project will develop extensions of these methods to handle different data types: spatially blurred data, or data formed via some more complicated linear imaging transformation (e.g., from light-field cameras); imaging data in which we can constrain and improve our results by exploiting simultaneously-recorded stimulus or behavioral information; and finally, imaging data recorded simultaneously with high-temporal-resolution multielectrode electrical data, in order to combine the strengths of these two data types. The proposed analytical tools will be widely used in the neuroscience community, and will have a strong influence on fundamental approaches to understanding neuroscience data; furthermore, the project will inform experimental paradigms and drive future data collection."

"9357642","Overview Project Summary  Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) is one of the most common heritable disorders of connective tissue. It is characterized by brittle bones, and over the past four decades, the genetics of OI has taught us about the basic mechanisms of procollagen assembly, post-translational modification, secretion, fibril formation and matrix mineralization. In an accelerated phase of discovery over the past 9 years, the identification of new OI genes has further informed us about the determinants of bone quantity and quality during skeletal development and homeostasis. This Program Project Grant (PPG) began in 2010 and has significantly contributed to this rapidly evolving field. In 2006, we reported that mutations in CRTAP caused recessive forms of severe OI (types III and VII). CRTAP is part of a trimeric protein complex including P3H1 and CYB that together are required for prolyl-3-hydroxylation, a poorly understood post-translational modification of clade A fibrillar collagens (e.g., types I, II, and V collagen). We also identified additional type I procollagen binding proteins, FKBP10 and HSP47, as important components in procollagen assembly and trafficking. We and others have since discovered that mutations in the genes encoding these proteins also contribute to the expanding group of brittle bone disorders (BBDs). The overall goal of this PPG is to elucidate the mechanistic consequences of mutations in procollagen and its modification proteins on bone and to translate this into new targeted diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. In this PPG renewal application, we hypothesize that the brittle bone phenotype in OI is a developmental model of abnormal bone quality and quantity that broadly integrates 1) altered matrix-to-cell signaling defects leading to abnormal bone quantity and cellular function, with 2) altered strength, biochemical nature and intermolecular placement of collagen crosslinks leading to abnormal bone mineralization and quality. To test this hypothesis, we will combine mouse genetic modeling, cell based studies, state-of-the-art mass spectrometric analysis of collagen with continued human genetic gene discovery to elucidate basic mechanisms that will inform genotype-based therapy and diagnostic biomarkers. The PPG will leverage infrastructure housed within the Co-Investigators' programs. The PPG is composed of three projects, a Functional Genomics Core, and an Administrative Core. The projects will answer three important questions. Project 1: What are the downstream mechanisms in WNT1 forms of OI and how do mutations affect osteoblast, osteoclast, osteocyte, and matrix function? Project 2: How do mutations in the FKBP65/HSP47 & PLOD2 collagen chaperone complex affect bone development? Project 3: What are the phenotypic and clinical consequences of altered crosslinking in OI patients and mice with defects affecting procollagen modification and trafficking with regard to bone?"
"9507195","ABSTRACT The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's primary charge is to safeguard the health and well being of the public through the application of scientifically sound regulatory activities. In our rapidly evolving scientific landscape, this complexity of this task continually grows. To help address this, the FDA created the Centers of Excellence in Regulatory Science and Innovation (CERSIs). The CERSIs provide institutions with a valued opportunity to work directly with regulators while simultaneously providing the FDA opportunities for access and exposure to advanced scientific exchange and training focused on the FDA's regulatory science priority areas. As one of the world's leading institutions in higher education, Johns Hopkins University is pleased to extend and expand our collaboration with the FDA as we develop fundamental new knowledge and tools to advance regulatory science. Our proposal leverages the historic relationship between the FDA and Johns Hopkins and it also builds upon the substantial infrastructure that we have developed together during the past two and a half years. Our partnership also has other strengths including the University's internationally renowned scholarship in regulatory science, an immense training platform, close geographic proximity to the FDA and a nimble and organic operational approach. In this new award, we propose to substantially expand our capacity and the return on investment for the FDA. To do so, we will integrate our CERSI further into additional Schools and Divisions at Johns Hopkins, including the Department of Biomedical Engineering and Department of Radiology and Radiological Sciences. We will also introduce several innovations such as a new regulatory toxicology curriculum and a global regulatory science training initiative, as well as nearly twenty compelling scientific proposals carefully selected due to their high relevance and expected impact on regulatory science. These avenues of scientific inquiry, as well as the broader opportunities for partnership with leading centers of higher education, serve as a testament to the ways that the FDA can maximize its effectiveness through state-of-the- art regulation in the 21st Century."
"9334284","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite established, evidence-based therapies, major gaps exist in asthma treatment, increasing the risk of asthma-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and oral steroid bursts. Provider (therapeutic inertia, insufficient time, patient (poor adherence, smoking), and system barriers (challenges with data, monitoring, communication, and medication refill) contribute to these gaps. The application of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) has the potential to lower these barriers leading to better asthma control and fewer exacerbations. The objective of this study is to conduct a large pragmatic trial to assess the effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, and implementation of the Breathewell intervention, which combines an evidence-based EHR intervention and team-based care to improve asthma outcomes. Breathewell employs EpicCare, the most widely used commercial EHR in the U.S, to identify poor medication adherence or unaddressed smoking and automatically enroll patients in a medication refill or smoking cessation program. For patients with asthma exacerbations or B-agonist inhaler overuse, the EHR sends the patients a decision support tool and notifies a nurse who uses an EHR-generated report to engage the patient in a shared-decision discussion, leading to development of an asthma care plan. EHR templated notes and order sets facilitate care plan execution. The study will be conducted in 26 primary care clinics of Kaiser Permanente Colorado using a cluster- randomized pragmatic clinical trial design. More than 10,400 asthma patients will be assigned to Breathewell or Usual Care based on their clinic. The evaluation assesses clinical effectiveness (asthma exacerbations, quality of life, and cost) and implementation (mediators and moderators of intervention effect, intervention barriers and facilitators, patient and provider impressions and RE-AIM framework translational measures). This study is significant because it could substantially reduce morbidity by addressing gaps in evidence-based asthma care. This research is innovative because it 1) uses the EHR to simultaneously addresses provider, patient, and system barriers to evidence-based care; 2) facilitates patient-centered decision making; 3) integrates evidence-based EHR and interactive behavioral change technologies; 4) is conducted as part of routine clinical care; and 5) is delivered in English and Spanish. Our results are likely to impact the field by speeding the translation of asthma care knowledge into practice. Successful deployment of Breathewell could serve as an implementation model for using EHRs to improve care for many chronic conditions, an NIH research priority and an objective of Healthy People 2020."
"9340012","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Hypertension (HTN) is a major risk factor for cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and renal disease, and its prevalence is increasing, particularly among the elderly. While the pathophysiology of HTN is multi-factorial, two major contributors appear to be salt-sensitivity and activation of the immune system. The prevailing paradigm regarding salt-sensitive HTN is based upon increased plasma volume and hydrostatic forces induced by intravascular sodium retention. Until recently, there was little consideration of the possibility that extravascular sodium stores may play a role in HTN. Through use of a novel non-invasive 23Na-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique, we have demonstrated the presence of significant sodium accumulation in skin and skeletal muscle. Experimental evidence indicates that these tissue sodium stores can trigger the immune system, particularly the helper T cells (Th17) that produce interleukin-17 (IL17). Activation of these T cells and the cytokine they produce, IL17, induces HTN in animal models. In preliminary studies, we have shown that skin sodium content is associated with systolic blood pressure. We also found that circulating IL17 levels are higher in hypertensive compared with normotensive individuals. However, definitive data from larger, community cohorts are needed. The Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (MESA) is the ideal cohort in which to translate our preliminary findings. Our underlying hypothesis is that tissue sodium-induced inflammation contributes to the development and progression of HTN, particularly salt-sensitive HTN. We propose an ancillary study with the following specific aims: 1) to define the distribution of tissue Na+ content in middle-aged to elderly individuals in the community, 2) to investigate the association of tissue sodium levels with blood pressure, and 3) to examine the association of tissue sodium with Th17 and other cellular markers of inflammation. We will non-invasively quantify skin sodium concentration using 23Na-MRI and measure blood pressure in all eligible MESA participants at the Chicago, IL field center during exam 6 (2016-2018). We will also quantify the number and types of circulating immune cells, such as Th17 cells, among MESA participants who undergo MRI measurement of tissue sodium concentration. The proposed research represents a unique opportunity to leverage a large, well-phenotyped, community population in which to translate novel findings from preclinical and early human studies to gain a deeper understanding of pathophysiologic contributors to HTN. The proposed research represents a systematic effort to build upon the investigators' prior studies on the mechanisms underlying HTN and the novel interactions between tissue sodium, inflammation, and blood pressure. These studies have the potential to provide important insight into the determinants of HTN. Furthermore, because visualizing tissue sodium by MRI is a novel non-invasive technology, establishing that tissue sodium is associated with inflammation and HTN could suggest novel approaches to the prevention and treatment of HTN and related disorders."

Dr. Greenberg recently replaced Dr.  Chodosh, the ACC's AD for Basic Research, who continues to be an active member. Members of the Program  are focused on understanding the underlying causes of breast cancer to improve the detection, prevention, and  treatment of this disease. They work together to achieve this goal by focusing on four key scientific areas: 1)  Elucidation of the genetic and molecular mechanisms of breast cancer development and progression; 2)  Improvements in genetic risk assessment and development of novel prevention strategies; 3) Development of  innovative imaging approaches to improve breast cancer detection and the assessment of therapeutic  response; and 4) Translation of laboratory discoveries to novel therapeutics and biomarkers of response and  outcome. Members are highly interactive, as reflected in their leadership of multiple collaborative grants,  including an NCI U01, an NCI U54, a Department of Defense (DOD) Breast Cancer Center of Excellence, a  DOD Idea Award, the Basser Center for BRCA, the 2-PREVENT Breast Cancer Translational Center of  Excellence and numerous interdisciplinary translational clinical trials. In addition to facilitating intra- and inter-  Programmatic collaborations, Program Leadership has emphasized breast cancer translational research as a  major focus, implementing a breast cancer biospecimen bank and database, recruiting external faculty with  important new expertise to the Program, and holding or participating in major ACC retreats that emphasize  breast cancer research. The ACC's investment in clinical research, particularly the interdisciplinary Rena  Rowan Breast Center, has facilitated patient-oriented research. The Program consists of 19 members from  eight departments in the Perelman School of Medicine and the School of Arts and Sciences. These members  have $9M in cancer-related grant funding (annual direct costs), of which $7.5M is peer-reviewed and $4.6M is  NCI-funded. During the current project period, members published 316 cancer-related papers, of which 9%  were the result of intra-Programmatic collaborations, 51% were the result of inter-Programmatic collaborations,  and 34% were multi-institutional."
"9263971","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mediator, a large (25 polypeptides, MW ~1 MDa) multi-protein complex conserved throughout eukaryotes is the key coactivator responsible for conveying regulatory signals to RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) during transcription initiation. Mediator has essentially no enzymatic activity and it is generally agreed that its mechanism must be based on modulation of molecular interactions and conformational rearrangements. Therefore, a structural understanding of Mediator and its interaction with RNAPII is essential to elucidate how Mediator's role during initiation ultimately influences cell differentiation, development, and homeostasis. Macromolecular electron microscopy (EM) is the technique of choice for characterization of large, dynamic macromolecular assemblies because it is uniquely suited to provide information about their structure, conformational changes, and interactions. EM studies of Mediator supported by this grant have set the stage to achieve a molecular understanding of the complex and here we describe further EM, biochemical, and functional analyses of yeast and human Mediators that build on our previous work and will provide a detailed understanding of the structure, subunit organization, and regulation of Mediator conformation and interactions, and reveal the mechanism of regulation by Mediator across eukaryotes.  In Aim 1 we will pursue EM analysis of yeast Mediator (yMED) at subnanometer resolution and investigate subunit interfaces critical for yMED assembly, conformational variability, and function. In Aim 2 we will study how different factors control Mediator conformation and interactions to modulate RNAPII engagement and transcription initiation, and obtain detailed structural information about the Mediator-RNAPII holoenzyme. In Aim 3 we will leverage the experience gained from EM analysis of yMED to pursue EM studies of the structure, subunit organization, and interactions of human Mediator (hMED). Parallel analysis of yeast and human Mediators will reveal fundamental aspects of the regulation mechanism related to structural conservation of Mediator across eukaryotes, while highlight aspects of regulation specific to the more intricate human complex.  Our results will provide a molecular understanding of the way in which Mediator enables regulation of transcription initiation, and help us understand the direct connection between dysregulation of gene expression and oncogenesis. The work we propose continues our strategy of combining structural analysis with biochemical and functional studies, and will depend critically on 1) application of novel EM image analysis approaches developed in collaboration with the group of Pawel Penczek (UT Houston) specifically tailored to study the structure of dynamic complexes; 2) a strong, ongoing collaboration with the group led by Joan and Ron Conaway (Stowers Institute), leaders in biochemical and functional studies of human Mediator."

"9517470","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application seeks continued support for years 36-40 of the Washington University Training Program in Immunology and Immunogenetics. Washington University has made a strong and lasting commitment to Immunology research and training through the development of an Immunology Graduate Program, responsible for directing graduate education in Immunology and coordinating the Immunology-related activities of the 50 faculty, 135 postdoctoral fellows and 71 graduate students that constitute our Immunology community. The Immunology community at Washington University has achieved a world-recognized status. It is characterized by a collaborative atmosphere that has helped establish an excellent environment for training young Immunologists. This grant and the Washington University Immunology Community have formed a symbiotic relationship where the growth of the community has been catalyzed through the benefits of trainee support afforded by this training grant and the quality of our training program has been enhanced by the growth and interactive nature of the community. This program contains elements that insure the appropriate training of Immunologists at both the predoctoral and postdoctoral levels. Fundamental laboratory research resides at the center of the training experience for both types of candidates. A total of 38 Immunology research faculty are listed on this grant but trainees can work with any of the 50 Immunologists in residence at Washington University. In addition, all trainees participate in University-wide Immunology seminars, journal clubs, work-in-progress meetings and retreats. Predoctoral trainees must complete and show competence in a rigorous curriculum of basic training where they are exposed, through formalized classroom experiences, to historical, modern and emerging concepts of Immunology, related biomedical sciences and research ethics. Postdoctoral trainees are provided with a similar scientific training, but additionally, they are mentored/advised for careers in immunology and a separate ethics course. To insure continuity of the comprehensive Immunology training experience that has been established at this institution, we request renewal of our 10 predoctoral and 6 postdoctoral trainee slots, a number that is unchanged from that of the current funding period.  The field of immunology impacts many areas of medical science, including autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, allergies, vaccines, and cancer. The training of predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows is an essential component of this research, and greatly helps today and in the future, the development of treatments and cure for these diseases."
"9397231","ABSTRACT In the United States, breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in women, and it results in the second highest mortality rate amongst women with cancer. Although the treatment paradigm for breast cancer has evolved in recent years, detection of metastases to regional lymph nodes remains a critical aspect of the clinical protocol and has strong implications for recurrence and survival in patients with early-stage breast cancer. Sentinel lymph node biopsy has emerged as a relatively low-morbidity option for the clinical evaluation of regional lymphatic metastases, but this procedure relies on radioisotopes and also carries a relatively high false-negative rate in detecting metastases. Alternative methods for sentinel lymph node detection and diagnosis have been explored, but they are not without weaknesses and have yet to gain clinical traction. To address the challenges in current clinical and research options, we propose ultrasound imaging of optically- triggered phase-change perfluorocarbon nanodroplets. This contrast-enhanced imaging approach has the potential to detect sentinel lymph nodes, to assess them for metastases, and to provide a vehicle for controlled drug delivery and release. As such, this platform can have a profound impact on the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer nodal metastases. Therefore, the overall goal of our research strategy is to validate this platform in a murine model of metastatic breast cancer. In Aim 1, we will optimize nanodroplets for lymphatic trafficking and establish their ability to successfully detect the sentinel lymph node. In Aim 2, we will synthesize molecularly- targeted nanodroplets and assess their ability to differentiate metastatic from non-metastatic sentinel nodes as part of a multiplexed approach for nodal detection and diagnosis. In Aim 3, we will finally adapt nanodroplets to deliver a therapeutic cargo locally and assess the efficacy of this strategy. We seek to deliver a theranostic option for breast cancer metastases that can be adapted to an array of metastatic neoplastic diseases. Because perfluorocarbon nanodroplets are synthesized from biocompatible reagents and are similar in composition to clinically-approved microbubbles, the path towards clinical translation is more optimistic than with other experimental agents. The training plan proposed to accomplish these goals has been specifically designed to provide the PI with the environment, training, and mentorship necessary to succeed as a clinically-minded independent researcher. The PI will participate in formal training in the ethical conduct of research and translational research as well as in co- curricular clinical experiences to prepare him for a future career as a physician-scientist."
"9280023","TR&D3 - Project Summary/Abstract  Significant increases in field strength have always led to new frontiers in the scientific arenas approachable by NMR spectroscopy. Often the challenges and what has been viewed as the drawbacks to high fields have proven to some of their greatest advantages. The Series Connected Hybrid (SCH) magnet, at a field of 36T, that will become operational in the summer of 2016 at the NHMFL will provide a view into the future for NMR spectroscopy; a future in which High Temperature Superconducting (HTS) magnets will have the potential for doubling the field strengths of current Low-Temperature superconducting (LTS) magnets. The SCH magnet is a hybrid magnet having an outer superconducting coil of 13T and inner stacks of Bitter plates that will be powered by 14MW and cooled by deionized water flowing through the stacks at 1700 gal/min. The SCH magnet will be the highest homogeneity and the highest stability resistive magnet that has been constructed, but the homogeneity and stability will not be the same as that for LTS magnets. The BTRR will develop a biomedical research focus on this magnet through the development of additional technology using a cross section of scientists committed to developing and pushing the scientific frontiers of NMR spectroscopy at a field strength that is more than 50% higher than any other NMR spectrometer in the world.  More than a decade of effort has now gone into developing new technologies to enhance the stability and homogeneity of this magnet. Two approaches are being taken: first, an advanced lock unit has been developed by Bruker and tested at the NHMFL and secondly, Prof. Jeffrey Schiano from Penn State has developed a cascade field regulation technology that takes advantage of an inductive pickup coil as well as NMR measurements to provide a feedback field correction. A new 1H detection HXY 1.3 mm MAS probe will be developed for structural biology solid state NMR. 1H detection has the potential to revolutionize solid state NMR in much the same way 1H detection revolutionized solution NMR 30 years ago. This revolution will open will facilitate the structural characterization of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers and potentially in native cellular membrane. This technology will be coupled with oriented samples ssNMR that provides complementary structural restraints.  The signal to noise per unit of spectrometer time for spin ½ nuclei improves with approximately B03, but for quadrupolar nuclei the rate of enhancement can be even greater due to a wide variety of factors including relaxation effects. While there are many odd halves quadrupolar nuclei in biological systems the most common and important one is 17O. Oxygen atoms are the primary sites in biological macromolecules of catalytic and functional chemistry. A goal in this effort is to work toward developing 17O spectroscopy as a routine spectroscopic tool."
"9326474","Cardiovascular disease (CVD) represents the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States in both men and women. CVD also represents the greatest medical economic burden in the U.S. A hallmark of heart failure is adverse extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, which is regulated by the collagen-crosslinking enzyme, lysyl oxidase (LOX). Little is known about the regulation of LOX in the diseased heart, or how increased LOX activity promotes the progression to overt heart failure. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of LOX inhibition to prevent cardiomyocyte detachment from the ECM, a phenomenon known as anoikis. This ultimately leads to cardiomyocyte apoptosis, programmed cell death. In our published findings and preliminary studies, Sprague-Dawley rats were subjected to surgically induced volume overload (VO) by creation of an aortocaval fistula (ACF). A LOX inhibitor, beta-aminopropionitrile (BAPN;100 mg/kg/d), was administered to rats with ACF or sham surgery at 8 weeks post-surgery. These rats had established ventricular remodeling and associated dysfunction caused by VO. Both echocardiography and catheterization measurements indicated improved cardiac function post-VO in BAPN treated rats versus untreated. We found that low inhibition reduced left ventricular (LV) collagen, and preliminary data indicate that this reduction was concomitant with a return to control levels of collagen I/III ratio. Further, the mechanisms underlying decreased cardiac function during disease were assessed by analyzing alterations in integrin expression. LOX inhibition attenuated VO-induced decreases in integrin expression. Altogether, these findings led us to hypothesize that inhibition of LOX confers cardioprotective effects by preventing the adverse ECM remodeling and decreased integrin expression that contributes to cardiomyocyte apoptosis, thereby maintaining systolic function and preventing heart failure. We will use an integrated approach to critically test this hypothesis by addressing the following specific aims: 1) will test the prediction that VO-stress induced increases in LOX activity promote progressive increases in cardiac fibrosis and 2) will test the prediction that decreased systolic function is a result of cardiomyocyte detachment, and subsequent apoptosis, resulting from decreased integrin expression and reduced myocyte adhesion to the ECM. Findings from the proposed studies will establish whether chronically increased cardiac LOX expression and activity promote adverse ECM alterations and cardiomyocyte apoptosis, thus accelerating the development of heart failure. Further, these studies may provide insight into novel therapies to target cardiac LOX for the regression of adverse ECM changes, dysfunction and heart failure."
"9279023","Leadership/Administrative Core Summary/Abstract The Leadership/Administrative Core (LAC) provides the administrative infrastructure and leadership to support the activities and growth of the entire UTMB OAIC, and fulfill our mission, which is to stimulate translation of the research findings to improve physical function and independence in older adults. The LAC specific aims are:  1. Provide overall leadership and direction for all activities of the UTMB OAIC.  2. Administer the UTMB OAIC program.  3. Communicate with the NIA and the community. To facilitate communication, promote scientific coherence and idea-generation, and bring new researchers to aging the LAC leadership takes two approaches to fostering multidisciplinary training and research in aging. A structural/administrative approach which includes monitoring FOAs and announcements for new research opportunities, distributing institution-wide announcements of OAIC and other funding and training opportunities, and organizing meetings for OAIC investigators, scholars, trainees and campus-wide presentations. The LAC also employs a proactive approach involving one-on-one conversations and networking, ad hoc small-group discussions focused on problem-solving, enlisting new individuals into the process, including investigators outside the aging field. Once Investigators and ideas are identified, we foster the creation of multidisciplinary translational teams, or modification of an existing one, and support them so that they can respond to new opportunities."
"9317362","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This research based training proposal is designed to build expertise in intervention research in schizophrenia (SZ), a common, chronic, disabling disorder that entails severe burden on patients and care givers. Medications, the mainstay of treatment for SZ provide only symptomatic relief and fail in the majority of cases, but pharmaceutical firms have slowed their research efforts due to uncertainty about the pathogenesis of SZ. These problems are magnified in low / middle-income countries (LMIC), where new medications are expensive and trained personnel are scant. The absence of effective remedies and the slowed pace of new drug development compel the need for additional research strategies. Research into repurposed drugs, i.e., drugs already licensed for other indications, is a cost effective, practically feasible option for LMICs. We are conducting such research in India and Egypt, two LMICs with a combined population of approximately 1.2 billion. Our training will involve both these countries. Our overall goal is to build human resourc capital by enlarging and sustaining a cadre of ethical psychiatric intervention researchers who will conduct novel research and train future trainees in their countries after completing our training. Through competitive nation-wide searches, we will identify and nurture highly motivated individuals for training in research on repurposed drugs for SZ and related themes. We will focus on psychiatry residents, graduate psychologists / social workers and exceptional medical students. Each trainee will receive didactic training, and then will be teamed with experienced mentor/s. Resources will be provided to each trainee to initiate or build on ongoing local research. Recognizing the aspirations and priorities of LMICs, we will also provide additional opportunities, such as 'hands on' ethics and laboratory based research tracks. Public meetings and special symposia will be used to inform local communities and to attract potential trainees. We will support our trainees well beyond their grant-funded training. Our broad training will enable them to conduct future research in disorders other than SZ, if they so desire. Capitalizing on our funded research, we will mentor 46 professionals through medium (6 months) or long term (2-4 year) training. Our innovative consortium spans 20 years and is based on a vision of international cross-fertilized research and training. Our work began in Delhi, India and has now spread across India and Egypt. Our LMIC collaborators have garnered local funds and resources for innovative research, assumed leadership roles and successfully initiated 'south-south' co-operation. We will include our prior trainees on our multi-disciplinary training faculty o encourage a multiplier effect, with efficient use of research and training funds. Other innovations include locally relevant research and novel strategies to attract potential trainees."
"9378614","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): College students with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) are particularly vulnerable to problematic alcohol use, given their developmentally-inappropriate levels of inattention, hyperactivity and impulsivity, combined with the lifestyle associated with life on a college campus (including increased access to alcohol, decreased structure and parental supervision). Our prior research demonstrates elevated rates of alcohol- related problems and disorders (AUDs) among college students with ADHD; 47% of college students with ADHD meet lifetime criteria for alcohol abuse and 23% meet criteria for dependence, as compared to 12% and 6% of college students from the general population, respectively. There are currently no published randomized controlled studies examining psychosocial interventions for college students with ADHD, and none specifically targeting AUDs in this population at any age, despite the clear indication from emerging research of the need for such interventions. Moreover, brief motivation-based alcohol interventions (BMIs) that generally have been successful for college students show limited benefits among individuals with elevated impulsivity and poor self- regulation, both hallmarks of ADHD, calling for the need to modify BMIs for this vulnerable group. Thus, it is crucial to determine core treatment components that are efficacious for treating AUDs and that are developmentally-appropriate for college students with ADHD and designed in a manner which promotes transportability to the university counseling center setting. Behavioral activation (BA) is a brief behavioral approach that aims to increase individuals' contact with valued environments through systematic efforts to increase rewarding experiences, enjoyment of daily activities, and goal-directed behaviors. We have successfully applied BA to substance users in a range of settings, including college students with problematic drinking patterns. Importantly, BA has clear relevance for addressing ADHD-related executive functioning deficits, which may be associated with an increased propensity for engagement in problematic alcohol use. Further, BA teaches individuals to engage in healthy, goal-directed rewarding behaviors, rather than relying on drinking to provide immediate rewards. Finally, BA is a highly adaptable intervention approach. In the current study, we will develop a BA-based treatment intended to reduce problematic drinking behaviors among college students with ADHD. This treatment will be developed in collaboration with the University Counseling Center, to ensure its applicability within this setting, utilizing focus grou methodology with Center staff. Finalized treatment manuals, altered based on focus group feedback, will be tested in a stage I RCT among 80 college students randomized to 3 sessions of BMI + BA or BMI + supportive counseling (SC). We expect that BMI + BA will be successful with college students with ADHD, in terms of decreasing the escalation of problematic alcohol use behaviors, as compared to BMI + SC. This treatment development study will set the stage for larger-scale RCTs (R01)."

Analyzing the Cardiac Power Grid: Adaptive responses to fluctuating local demand brings together seasoned investigators at U Washington, UC San Diego, University of Michigan, and Medical College of Wisconsin. This project will provide a central, core structure for integrative thermodynamically- and anatomically-constrained versions of the Cardiac Physiome, a large multiscale, multi-modular computer representation and resource for collating, coalescing and conciliating models as hypotheses and data from all 4 groups as tests of their validity. The research products will be publicly available, comprehensive data and models systematizing these data from subcellular, cell, tissue and organ levels: these will guide further experimental studies to test hypotheses and to identify therapeutic targets. The models will be composed of reproducible modules, each modifiable to accommodate new knowledge, and each in several forms ranging from simple descriptive to deeply mechanistic. The approach is middle out, neither top-down, nor bottom-up, but cell-centric, covering interactions among several cell types, with information flow up to the organ level and down to the protein level, so providing the sites for future linkages to regulate transcription. The data, he tools developed, the modules and the composite models, and the reproducible exchange packages (REP) of data and models are all open source. The three aims span Cell, Tissue, and Organ levels, and are strongly intertwined: (Aim 1) Power Generation and its Distribution on the Grid focuses on cellular and mitochondrial energetics, substrates for energy supply and purine nucleoside transport and exchange. It is given the largest write-up and is used as the power source by Aims 2 and 3. (Aim 2) Heterogeneities in Power Dissipation: Local Workloads links anatomic (high-resolution ventricular fiber and sheet arrangements), physiologic (excitatory spread and force generation) and metabolic (ATP and substrate use) to relate to regional myocardial blood flows. (Aim 3) Cardiomyocyte Control of Flows of Substrates for Power Generation involves 4 cell types (cardiomyocyte, smooth muscle, endothelium and RBC) and the relationships amongst them controlling blood flow. (Aim 4) Simulation Resource Core provides tools for modeling analysis of data, develops new technology for the semi-automated assembly, and disassembly and modification of models using reusable modules. Annotation of model code against standard ontologies identifies model elements precisely, and facilitates reuse by researchers worldwide."

We target early stage investigators, including Scholars not directly funded through the RCDC, and also investigators well established in other areas who can turn their expertise to develop parallel studies in aging consistent with the OAIC theme. The PESC funds one or two-year pilot grants and small exploratory projects. The PESC mobilizes our substantial institutional resources to support research efforts from the bench to clinical trials and patient-centered outcomes research in geriatrics. We have selected four pilot/exploratory studies for the first year of the new cycle. The PESC process is broader than simply awarding funds for OAIC pilot research. The goal is to support aging research at the institutional level. The most important outcome is new external funding resulting from work supported by the PESC."
"9376074","PROJECT SUMMARY  The purpose of this study is to increase the use of evidence-based practice, specifically data collection, among paraprofessionals working one-to-one with children with autism. We propose to develop and test strategies to increase their self-efficacy, supervision, and sense of belonging to a professional community, with opportunities for peer comparison and supervisor acknowledgement as mechanisms to increase the use of data collection. We chose data collection because: 1) it is a component of every evidence-based intervention for children with autism and is common to many mental health interventions for other children as well; 2) this foundational practice is essential to monitoring outcomes associated with other practices, and has been associated with more positive outcomes in and of itself; and 3) it results in a measureable work product that lends itself to objectively estimating the effectiveness of our implementation strategies. Our implementation strategy is based on psychological principles that inform behavioral economics. We will use a participatory design approach to build a digital app on the Way To Health platform that allows paraprofessionals to 1) easily collect and upload data; 2) observe how they compare with their peers in data collection; and 3) receive positive recognition from their supervisors and employers in response to frequent and accurate data collection. Specifically, we will: 1) Observe and query 10 paraprofessionals in the field to examine how they collect data, functional and structural barriers to data collection, and paraprofessionals' attitudes, subjective norms and self- efficacy regarding data collection; 2) Using rapid prototyping, integrate Aim 1 findings into the Way To Health app, making data collection easier and more socially desirable, and refine the app based on our observations and data collection; 3) Test the refined app with 20 paraprofessionals from two naïve agencies; and 4) Explore how use of other evidence-based autism interventions could be objectively and inexpensively measured and rewarded using the same technology. This project builds on our 30-year-old partnership with Philadelphia's Department of Behavioral Health and our decade of experience studying evidence-based autism interventions in the community. Successful completion of the proposed study will lead to an R01-funded randomized trial to rigorously examine the power of behavioral economics principles, operationalized through digital technology, to improve use of evidence-based mental health interventions in the community. The project directly ties in with our Methods Core in that we will test an implementation strategy development process (rapid cycle prototyping) and refine measures of psychological factors associated with implementation (normative pressure). Given that paraprofessionals are the fastest growing group of health care workers, with frontline responsibility for the care of individuals with a variety of psychiatric and developmental disabilities, the proposed project has broad public health implications with regard to how we improve mental health care.  "
"9384841","Project Summary: The MCW hematopoietic cell transplant and cell therapy (HCT CT) program proposes to contribute as a BMT CTN Core Center based on our expertise in HCT, novel cell therapies, prior accrual history, quality data submission, clinical trial design and novelty of scientific idea. We seek to advance the key scientific area of gene therapy for Hemophilia A using the multi-site BMT CTN platform for a phase I-II study in patients with Hemophilia A and refractory FVIII inhibitors. Over the past decade, our basic science group has advanced the idea of curing severe Hemophilia A (HA) using patient?s own platelets to ectopically express and store FVIII for release at sites of vascular injury where it can be available for clot formation. This approach has been extensively tested in preclinical syngeneic and xenograft mouse models, canine models, human primary cells and cell lines with great success. The proposed idea is a phase I-II, first in human, gene therapy study using reduced intensity conditioning HCT to engraft a gene modified autologous graft capable of producing platelets that express and store FVIII. The gene modified autologous graft is produced by CD34 cell selection of an autologous apheresis product, followed by transduction with a lentiviral vector carrying the B domain deleted form of FVIII under the control of an ITGA2B promoter. We hypothesize that following engraftment of the gene modified graft, lineage specific expression of FVIII gene in the megakaryocyte lineage will lead to a proportion of circulating platelets synthesizing and storing FVIII. Platelets ? granules containing FVIII (an immune privileged site) will provide FVIII at the sites of vascular injury where platelet aggregation and activation occurs. This approach limits the immunogenicity of FVIII without limiting availability, can induce tolerance and restore hemostasis in subjects with inhibitors without the need for FVIII bypassing agents or tolerizing FVIII infusions. This early phase trial is limited to those with refractory inhibitors to FVIII, a subgroup with no effective therapy and area of significant unmet need. In preclinical tests, platelet FVIII expression was highly effective at producing hemostasis even in those with high titer inhibitors, was not associated with thrombosis or mutagenesis and was able to lower inhibitor titers. We believe the use of lower intensity conditioning will be safe rendering this a major innovation in the field and with potential future application to FVIII gene in HA patients without inhibitors, severe von Willebrand?s disease and other transgenes in platelet receptor disorders."
"9132659","Are Americans economically prepared for retirement? The popular media and some researchers have  expressed doubt, given the shift from defined-benefit to defined-contribution retirement plans, but a few  empirical studies state otherwise. This project estimates life-cycle trajectories of consumption and  spending for single and married persons. The estimates explicitly include important components such as the  consumption of owner-occupied housing services and out-of-pocket spending on health care and long-term  care. Those estimates are combined with data on income and wealth to evaluate the risk of exhausting  wealth before death. The project will also shed some light on why spending declines with age: Is it because  of mortality risk or because of worsening health? The project includes an assessment of the effect of the  Great Recession on preparedness for retirement.  Life-cycle trajectories of spending are estimated through two methods. The first is based on  nonparametrically estimated models of life-cycle consumption for single persons and for couples. Based on  these and on income and asset data, a simulation model estimates the probability of depleting assets before  death. This approach is transparent and not encumbered by restrictions on functional form but does not well  support utility or welfare analysis or policy simulations. In the second approach, expected utility maximization  under uncertainty is imposed, which leads to the use of dynamic programming models. These can account  for behavioral responses to environmental variations but are difficult computationally. The simulations based  on the nonparametric models and those based on the dynamic programming models are complementary in  terms of their respective strengths and weaknesses. Both approaches make extensive use of the richness  of the available data, which are drawn from the Health and Retirement Study and its Consumption and  Activities Mail Survey."
"9385149","Project Summary/Abstract The University of Minnesota has been highly committed to The BMT CTN. Our expertise on alternative donors and graft-vs-host disease served as the basis for successful Network studies. Our participation in the Network includes a past-Steering Committee chair, national PIs on six protocols, leading roles in Network publications and committing institutional resources to develop and successfully execute Network trials. Our proposal addresses the risk of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) relapse after reduced intensity allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), which remains the main cause of treatment failure. Our institutions long-lasting interest on natural killer (NK) cell biology as a critical mediator of the graft-versus-tumor/leukemia (GVL) effect led to the development of this platform using ALT-803, a soluble complex consisting of two protein subunits of a human IL-15 variant associated with high affinity to a dimeric human IL-15 receptor ? (IL-15R?) sushi domain/human IgG1 Fc fusion protein enhancing NK cell specificity and half-life. Our hypothesis is that stimulating the innate immune system with ALT-803 will reduce the cumulative incidence of relapse and improved probability of relapse-free survival (RFS), after reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) HCT. In early clinical trial studies we demonstrated the safety and established side effect profile of ALT-803 when given to patients with advanced hematological malignancies, including post-allogeneic HCT. A phase 2 study on ALT-803 administration as maintenance after reduced intensity allogeneic HCT for AML and myelodysplastic syndrome is in the last steps of regulatory approval and will provide further data on the safety and feasibility of the post-transplantation maintenance approach. The primary objective of the proposed the phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial in this proposal is to determine if ALT-803 improves the probability of disease-free survival as maintenance after reduced intensity allogeneic HCT for AML in first complete remission. The administration of immune modulatory agents such as ALT-803 aiming reducing the risk of relapse and improve outcomes after HCT is one of many potentially practice changing strategies that require confirmation on a multicenter randomized clinical trial, which is part of the BMT CTN mission. Our institution's continued commitment to the Network's success is not only reflected in developing new protocols, but alos continued internal process to better support regulatory, enrollment and sample collection requirements Network clinical trials.  "

Abstract The overall objective of the `Revealing Reservoirs during Rebound' (R3) program is to understand mechanisms and dynamics of HIV RNA rebound though the body after treatment interruption. To achieve this goal will require a concerted effort with the collection and generation of large amounts of complex and multidimensional data. The quality assurance (QA) and management of these data will be key in the appropriate interpretation of generated results to meet program aims. The Quality Assurance and Data Core will provide centralized expertise for the development, validation and application of effective and efficient quality assurance procedures and data management platforms to address the goals of the R3 program. In particular, this core proposes a quality assurance solution ? focusing on (i) validating laboratory based methods in blood and tissue, and (ii) determining accuracy and reliability of the proposed essays ? and a data solution ? focusing on developing infrastructure for (i) data collection, storage and backup, (ii) data access and visualization, and (iii) data accuracy and reliability. These solutions will be based on state-of-the art technology for data storage and data management, as well as validated quality assurance procedures. The Quality Assurance and Data Core Team will be working directly with investigators from the R3 research projects (RPs) to provide customized solutions that directly address the needs of the specific RPs. Offering these services as part of one core will reduce costs and allow program investigators to leverage shared resources more efficiently than if each RP were to develop and manage their own quality assurance and data management solutions."
"9405715","Natural killer (NK) cells provide rapid early responses to viral infections and thus can contribute substantially to disease modulation and vaccine protection. Traditionally, NK cells have been considered to be nonspecific components of innate immunity, but recent studies in mice have shown that NK cells can also demonstrate features of antigen-specific memory. Until recently it was unclear whether this phenomenon might exist in primates, but our preliminary data demonstrates for the first time evidence of antigen-specific NK cell memory in any primate species. As compared with NK cells from uninfected macaques, splenic and hepatic NK cells from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected animals were highly reactive to Gag- and Env-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) but not to mock-pulsed DCs or mis-matched antigen controls. Similar Gag-specific NK cell responses were found in treated and untreated HIV-1- infected patients. Interestingly, memory NK cell responses in peripheral blood were low compared to distal sites, suggesting memory NK cells reside predominantly in tissues. We also found NK cell memory responses in rhesus macaques for over 5 years following vaccination with recombinant Ad26 vectors expressing HIV-1 Env or SIV Gag indicating antigen-specific NK cell memory is durable and does not require ongoing antigenic stimulation. The longevity, functionality, and specificity of memory NK cell responses in primates suggest their functional relevance and their potential importance against HIV-1 and other pathogens. In this new proposal we will address major deficits to this new field of study including identifying the mechanisms, kinetics, distribution, and efficacy of these responses using state-of-the-art techniques. We will evaluate the overarching hypothesis that memory NK cell responses elicited against SIV/HIV and adenovirus vaccine vectors are long-lived even in the absence of replicating virus and can be mobilized to engage and lyse virus-infected cells in an antigen- specific manner. We will evaluate this hypothesis with three focused Specific Aims: (1) Evaluate mobilization and recall of memory NK cells elicited against HIV and SIV vaccine antigens in humans and macaques; (2) Evaluate mobilization and maintenance of memory NK cells after SIV challenge in vaccinated and unvaccinated macaques; and (3) Explore cellular and molecular mechanisms of memory NK cell recognition and specificity."
"9335755","Project Summary Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) is a twisting condition of the spine and is the most common pediatric musculoskeletal disorder, affecting 3% of children worldwide. Children with AIS risk severe disfigurement, back pain, and pulmonary dysfunction later in life. Girls requiring treatment for AIS outnumber boys by more than five-fold. AIS is treated symptomatically rather than preventively because the underlying etiology is unknown. Hospital charges for AIS surpass one billion dollars annually in the U.S. and are rising significantly faster than for other pediatric procedures. Our overall purpose is to understand the biologic causes of AIS as a means to early diagnosis, prevention and non-invasive biologic treatment. AIS is a complex genetic disease. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) by our group and others have identified AIS-associated regions harboring presumed regulatory sequences. For example, with our Project 3 (Genomics) collaborators we have recently shown that AIS-associated variants disrupt a putative enhancer of the PAX1 gene that is known to participate in spinal development. We also demonstrated that this locus is specifically associated with AIS in females. While these GWAS has yielded loci worthy of further study, they cumulatively account for <5% of the total genetic risk in AIS. In this Project we propose new approaches to identify the genes and mutations expected to convey substantial disease risk. In one approach we will perform exome-focused GWAS in our collection of 2,750 AIS cases and >20,000 population controls to discover disease-associated mutations in AIS candidate genes and their regulatory elements. In our second approach we will perform whole genome sequencing (WGS) in trios with affected males to discover mutations expected to convey strong disease risk. Selected genes and regulatory sequences will be characterized further by genome editing in zebrafish (Project 2) and enhancer studies (Project 3). We will define the mutational burden in AIS by large-scale re-sequencing of candidate genes and regulatory regions discovered in this project by GWAS, as well as those discovered by in Projects 2 and 3. For example, our Project 2 (Zebrafish) collaborators have discovered that multiple alleles of kif6 produce an AIS phenotype in zebrafish, prompting us to add this gene to our candidate list. For our mutation screens we will re-sequence at least 4,000 AIS cases and controls using our established method of molecular inversion probe-based targeting and massively parallel sequencing. To provide critical reagents for hypothesis-driven functional analysis of AIS, we will simultaneously expand our existing biobank of DNA, cells, tissues, and surgical samples from patients ascertained in pediatric orthopaedic centers. Finally, for patients with defined AIS-causing mutations, we will team with clinical experts in AIS to evaluate potential phenotypic correlations that may define clinical subtypes. By synergizing with other projects in the program we will define a substantial fraction of the genetic risk in AIS and establish important tools for characterizing the underlying disease mechanisms."
"9292271","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Recent advances in technology allow for the possibility of more dynamic assessment and monitoring of older individuals across a variety of key environments: rehabilitation, long term care, home, and assisted living. Within the past year, intelligent easy-to-use electronic devices have been brought to market that are able to collect and transmit various types of biodata-patient position, time in motion, and even responses to questionnaires delivered remotely. These devices can also be paired with in-facility and in-home ambient activity and location sensors to monitor patient movement and activity continuously over time and provide real-time feedback about changes in patient status over time. This technology comes at a very critical time when our aging population will result in large numbers of geriatric patients placing increasing demand on our healthcare system (in both acute care and post-acute care settings). Projections indicate that in the near future our supply of trained medical personnel will not be sufficient to meet the patient demand of our growing population. In preparation for this project, our group has already designed and validated platform that includes: a SmartWatch, ambient location and activity sensors, a smarthphone, and an specialized application and analytic engine for functional and performance measurement designed for pre-frail and frail individuals.. This platform allows for the detection and classification of patient motion and position with an accuracy of over 85%.This project proposal seeks to expands and clinical validate our current technology to establish a more comprehensive remote sensing system called the Safety and Independence Tracking System. Participating subjects will be monitored in several post-acute care settings of interest: acute rehabilitation, long-term care or nursing facility, and at home. Participation will commence at time of hospital discharge and will last 21 days in rehabilitation and 3 months in long-term care or at home. Our current validated and tested tools allow for continuous, passive collection of important information characterizing patient position, physical function, indoor location, and specific activities of interest (includin validated measures like ADLs, IADLs and Get up and Go) without requiring time in today's busy clinical settings. This project will apply our novel healthcare monitoring system in a large population of elderly patients through various phases of post-acute care: rehabilitation, long-term care, assisted living and the home. The data collected by our intelligent system can in turn be used to generate novel, personalized predictive models and algorithms. We can apply these models to encourage safety by detecting evolving fall risk, track independence by monitoring validated activities over time, and decrease healthcare utilization by predicting risk for hospitalization and allowing for early intervention by providers and caregivers."

"9359392","Project Summary  The Tumor Virology Program serves as the central forum for facilitating interactions among virologists involved  in cancer-related research, and investigators with an interest in the etiological basis of cancer. Program  members have broad expertise in the biology of tumor viruses, including EBV, KSHV, alpha and beta  herpesvirus, HPV, HCV, HIV and other retroviruses, as well as emerging viral agents including Merkel cell  polyoma viruses and other recently identified gamma-herpesviruses. The Program facilitates research in  thematic areas through highly interactive and productive affinity groups in Viral Oncogenesis, DNA Virology,  and Viral Receptors and Retrovirology. Since 2002, the Program has been led by Erle Robertson, PhD; in  2012, David Weiner, PhD, a pioneer in translational medicine and vaccine development, became Program Co-  Leader. Both Co-Leaders are experienced, well-funded and highly collaborative in their leadership and  research activities. During the project period, important strides have been made to further develop the  Program, which include fostering a stronger focus on translational research, developing new intra- and inter-  Programmatic collaborative efforts, recruiting additional tumor virologists, and better member engagement  through Program meetings as well as interdisciplinary, inter-Programmatic retreats. In doing so, the Tumor  Virology Program has nucleated interest among basic and clinical investigators in studying the roles of viruses  in cancer with collaborating members from the Tumor Biology, Immunobiology, Cancer Control, Cancer  Therapeutics, and Radiobiology and Imaging Programs. The major aims of the Program are to: 1) Understand  the mechanisms mediating cellular transformation, immortalization and cell cycle dysregulation by viral  encoded proteins; 2) Understand the viral-receptor interactions and the structure/function of viral receptors; 3)  Understand the molecular biology and pathogenesis of retroviruses as they relate to AIDS and AIDS-related  malignancies; 4) Develop viral vectors for human cancer gene therapy; and 5) Develop vaccine strategies for  treatment of viral-associated cancers. The Tumor Virology Program consists of 22 members from five  departments and two schools. Two new members have been added to the Program in the last five years,  increasing its breadth and strength. Program members have $10.2M in cancer-related grant funding (annual  direct costs), of which $6.9M is peer-reviewed and positioned to support cancer-related studies. $1.8M is  directly NCI-funded.

"9329213","ABSTRACT Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the world?s leading cause of disability. While effective treatments for MDD are available, ~50% of patients will not experience clinical benefits after 3-months of treatment. Of these patients, -30% are defined to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Acting to inhibit NMDA receptors, ketamine is shown to produce a rapid therapeutic response in up to 70% of TRD patients, though the antidepressant mechanisms themselves are not understood. While many studies have used neuroimaging to show that MDD is associated with particular brain abnormalities, few imaging studies have addressed the neural effects of ketamine and/or have determined whether imaging measures prior to treatment might dissociate individuals who will benefit from ketamine. By leveraging training opportunities and infrastructure provided by a larger funded project for which the sponsor of this application serves as PI, to address this gap, this F32 proposal uses diffusion MRI (dMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rsfMRI) to determine whether serial ketamine therapy relates to changes in structural and functional connectivity within and between brain regions widely implicated in MDD. Patients (n=60) are scanned and receive mood ratings before treatment, 24 hours after the first ketamine infusion, and 24 hours and 6 weeks after last ketamine treatment. Demographically similar controls (n=40) receive MRI scans at two time points to establish normative values. Our first aim addresses whether white matter integrity measured with dMRI and functional connectivity measured with rsfMRI in fronto-limbic-striatal circuits at baseline relate to improved depressive symptoms 24 h after first and last ketamine infusion. We hypothesize that ketamine non-responders will have greater deficits in structural and functional connectivity in these circuits compared to responders and controls. Our second aim addresses whether ketamine therapy is associated with longitudinal changes in structural and functional connectivity in these same networks. We hypothesize that ketamine responders will show a normalization or compensation in network connectivity, with no change over time in non-responders and that connectivity measures will return to baseline values 6 weeks after treatment in patients who relapse. Since ketamine may benefit symptoms of anhedonia and apathy more than other treatments, Aim 3 will investigate the neural correlates of these behavioral constructs following serial ketamine and determine if changes are sustained at 6-weeks. We hypothesize ketamine will relate to pronounced reductions in anhedonia and apathy in responders and that degree of change will relate to changes in structural and functional connectivity; we will test whether these behavioral changes are more or less sustainable at 6-weeks. Research outcomes are expected to clarify the mechanisms underlying antidepressant response to ketamine therapy, which could impact future treatment decisions to benefit individual patients. This project will provide important training and career development opportunities in computational image analysis and MDD treatment research."
"9342879","While smoking cessation leads to significant improvements in mortality and morbidity, weight gain post- cessation partially attenuates this benefit. Furthermore, concerns about postcessation weight gain are common and are often cited as a reason to delay cessation attempts. In addition, postcessation weight gain is associated with smoking relapse. Thus, although the health benefits of smoking cessation outweigh the negative impact of weight gain, ideally there would be intervention ?packages? that would not require that people choose between smoking cessation and nontrivial weight gain. Thus, in the proposed study, we will determine whether two very promising methods of reducing postcessation weight gain, namely a weight stability intervention (based on the evidence-based Stability Skills First intervention) versus a weight loss intervention (based on the evidence-based Look AHEAD intensive lifestyle intervention) followed by a smoking cessation intervention are efficacious for reducing postcessation weight gain. We will randomize 400 smokers to one of three arms: a) a weight stability intervention prior to cessation (STABLE); b) a weight loss intervention prior to cessation (LOSS), or c) a bibliotherapy comparison condition prior to cessation (BIBLIO) and to determine the efficacy of the interventions on preventing weight gain at 12 month follow-up. All three conditions receive a highly efficacious in-person smoking cessation behavioral intervention and six months of Varenicline (ChantixTM) pharmacotherapy. Those participants randomized to the STABLE and LOSS conditions will receive monthly booster weight management sessions, after completing the behavioral smoking cessation intervention. The primary outcomes will be weight change and smoking cessation at 12 month follow-up. In addition, we will gather process data on mediators of treatment outcome via measures of treatment engagement (e.g., session attendance, varenicline utilization). We will be able to determine whether a weight stability intervention or a weight loss intervention is efficacious in reducing post-cessation weight gain. The intervention results, if successful, could be disseminated and make a significant contribution towards curtailing obesity in this vulnerable population."
"9291476","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Negative feedback control is essential to make biological systems stable to internal and external perturbations, just as homes need thermostats to maintain a fixed room temperature. In cells feedback is used to regulate everything from gene expression to chromosome replication, and its failure causes a range of human disorders. But our understanding of feedback in biology is very incomplete. Most theoretical approaches use mathematical frameworks that are poorly suited to describe cells because they ignore a main source of perturbations: chemical reactions involve molecules in low numbers and since each individual reaction is probabilistic, fluctuations in concentrations arise spontaneously. Unlike human-designed systems, where the control systems (e.g. thermostats) are fundamentally different from what they control (temperature fluctuations), the control systems in cells are similar to the processes they control. This makes it very difficult for cells to suppress perturbations, and also makes it very difficult for researchers to analyze the control system design. Experimentally, very few systems allow both accurate measurements of concentrations in single cells and systematic modifications of the control system to analyze how they affect the system. Analyses can also focus so closely on the specific details of one specific system that general guiding principles are overlooked or misinterpreted. We propose to address these problems by developing new mathematical approaches and systematically applying our novel experimental assays to simple model systems, bacterial plasmids. Our preliminary theory demonstrates hard limits on the ability of negative feedback to suppress fluctuations in cells. It also suggests creative and counter-intuitive mechanisms that minimize these problems. Remarkably enough, we have found examples of these in plasmid gene clusters that we know are under strong selection to suppress noise. In addition to the usefulness of these systems to understand feedback control, bacterial plasmids are also very relevant medically, since they cause the majority of drug resistance cases in hospitals, a problem that leads to millions of serious illnesses and tens of thousands of deaths annually in the US alone. They are also key tools for the biotechnology industry, where the fluctuation suppression properties we study are a significant nuisance. The unmatched experimental tractability of plasmids allows us to systematically vary control properties and rigorously test the mathematical descriptions experimentally, leading to a deeper understanding of feedback mechanisms and also an increase in useful knowledge about plasmid behavior."
"9132660","A major impulse for the study of subjective well-being has been the question how policy affects the distribution of subjective well-being within a country. A natural approach to learning about policy effects is to compare policies across countries and relate these to observed differences in well-being. Most of the work on international comparisons of well-being has been based on global satisfaction measures, like single questions inviting respondents to rate their happiness on a numerical or verbal scale. This work has often produced conflicting findings. More recently, experienced well-being has been proposed as an alternative measure. Both approaches to the measurement of well-being are in principle vulnerable to Differential Item Functioning, particularly when used to compare different countries. We essentially propose providing a laboratory for the development of subjective well-being measures and procedures for making them internationally comparable. This includes a thorough analysis of the properties of the different well-being measures and in particular how anchoring vignettes can be used to improve the comparability of well-being measures across population groups and across countries. To that end we will conduct several experiments in two population representative Internet panels: the American Life Panel (ALP) in the U.S. and the LISS panel in The Netheriands. RELEVANCE (See instructions): There is ample evidence that well-being is related to health outcomes, while subjective well-being is also an important outcome in its own right. A better understanding of how to measure subjective well-being and how alternative measures may lead to different conclusions will aid policy decision making."

"9513173","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Bullying, sexual violence, and dating violence among adolescents are all major public health problems that occur at relatively high rates and demand attention to alleviate the considerable suffering they cause. These problems share developmental correlates and evidence is emerging that bully perpetration and victimization is concurrently and longitudinally associated with sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and teen dating violence involvement (Basile et al., 2009; Espelage et al., 2012). Despite the costs of bullying, the impact of prevention programs in the US has been disappointing, especially in middle-schools. Social-emotional learning (SEL) programs are reducing aggression in US schools (Durlak et al., 2011), in part, by helping students develop social and emotional skills to manage conflicts, but effects could be greater. Data presented in this application strongly suggest that to increase effects, school-based bullying prevention programs need to: 1) integrate evidence-based approaches that focus on different levels of influence (individual, peer, school), 2) focus on gender-based harassment and violence (i.e., sexual harassment and violence, dating violence, harassment and violence associated with sexual orientation and/or gender-role nonconformity) and 3) address a major driver of bullying and gender-based harassment and violence - traditional masculine ideology and homophobic name-calling. Thus, this application proposes a large-scale RCT comparing the Second Step (CfC, 2008) program to a gender-enhanced Second Step + Shifting Boundaries program (SB; Taylor et al., 2011). The SB program combines a classroom curriculum that addresses sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and dating violence with whole-school strategies to decrease these outcomes. School-wide strategies include school protocols for responding to dating violence and sexual harassment and increased monitoring of hot spots. Twenty-eight middle schools (grades 6 - 8) from two school districts in Illinois will be randomly assigned to either the Second Step only condition or the gender-enhanced Second Step condition (Second Step/SB). Two cohorts (6th and 7th graders) will complete baseline and follow-up surveys. Study aims are to evaluate the differential efficacy of the Second Step: Student Success Through Prevention program (Second Step) versus a gender-enhanced Second Step program (Second Step/SB) on reducing bullying, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and teen dating violence; to assess the extent to which gender-enhanced Second Step versus Second Step results in greater increases in positive bystander intervention around bullying, sexual harassment, gender-based harassment, and teen dating violence; and to test the extent to which the intervention impacts peer-level attitudes toward bullying, sexual harassment, homophobic name-calling, and teen dating violence through its effect on peer social dynamics. This study is highly innovative and could have substantial public health impact by targeting bullying, dating violence, and sexual harassment."
"9356594","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including diabetes and hypertension, are becoming grave emerging health threats in sub-Saharan Africa, especially among people living with HIV. The health of people living with NCDs and HIV could be significantly improved through interventions encouraging behavioral lifestyle changes, and family-based interventions to enact such change show exciting promise. However, little research has been conducted on these conditions and on interventions to address them in sub-Saharan Africa. In contrast, HIV has been extensively researched and has become a chronic condition in these settings. Due to the existing, well-developed infrastructure of HIV-related services and the commonalities in providing long-term care for HIV and NCDs, developing interventions that integrate screening and care for non-communicable diseases with HIV care is needed. However, more needs to be understood on the prevalence and risk factors of these conditions prior to developing an effective, feasible intervention. Therefore, this mixed methods study seeks to (1) establish the prevalence and risk factors of diabetes and hypertension among people receiving HIV-related care in urban Tanzania and (2) understand families? knowledge, beliefs, and actions relating to diabetes and hypertension and how this can lead to implementing a family-centered intervention to improve health for this population. To realize these objectives, we propose screening 364 clients receiving HIV-related care for diabetes and hypertension and conducting further assessments with a sub-set of clients? families. Within 40 families, we will conduct home-based screening for diabetes and hypertension for all adult family members. These families will also be interviewed to assess their understanding of diabetes and hypertension, how the family environment contributes to NCD risks, and how the family can be used to increase support and decrease NCD risks for people living with HIV. Results from this study will be used to develop and test a relevant, culturally-appropriate family-based intervention to improve patient health outcomes for HIV and NCDs."

In West Philadelphia, an area with a population that is largely African American and with poverty rate among the highest in the country and having a Promise Zone designation; 43% of the community is obese. One out of five youth in Philadelphia perform no physical activity at all. Research has demonstrated the positive moderating effect of family-level interventions to increase intervention efficacy with African American youth. Approaches that incorporate two and three generations hold promise not only to increase the interventions health impacts on individual participants, but also to influence health outcomes for entire families. Therefore, building on the University of Pennsylvania's (Penn's) longstanding partnerships with the Philadelphia schools as family and community hubs, we propose a intergenerational approach to increasing easily accessible, safe, enjoyable and sustainable physical activity for youth and their families in West Philadelphia. Our specific aims are as follows: Specific Aim 1: Identify interest, goals, priorities and barriers related to physical activity- Convene focus group with youth and their families; these focus groups will be supported by Penn's Academically Based Community Service Courses. Specific Aim 2: Catalog the current state of physical activity interventions, share ideas and vision for program improvements, collaboration and new activities. Identify a group of diverse stakeholders to identify strengths and barriers to current activity programs, and then develop possible action plans that would increase activity. Sub aim-2A- Representatives from the key stakeholder group will be invited to join a Community Advisory Board (CAB). Sub aim 2B will result in the development of an MOU. In Specific Aim 3 we will convene a seminar and a conference, presented by School District leaders, community organizations, researchers and attended by a broadly diverse group of key stakeholders to review possible action plans and develop a health disparity research and action agenda that will support further development and implementation of action plans selected to move forward.

"9413062","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Zika virus (ZIKV) is a mosquito-transmitted flavivirus that has been implicated in devastating birth defects such as microcephaly, ventriculomegaly, cerebellar hypoplasia, and fetal akinesia deformation sequence (arthrorgryposis). An ongoing Zika epidemic in Central and South America reached the continental U.S. when autochthonous cases were first documented in Florida in June 2016. To mitigate morbidity following Zika infection during pregnancy, a clearer understanding of how maternal-fetal transmission occurs is needed. We hypothesize that ZIKV infects placental cells with an impaired innate immune response, while cells that have active innate immune defenses are resistant to ZIKV. Once ZIKV is able to propagate through the placenta, transplacental passage of the virus to the fetus may occur. Here we propose to define the placental cell types vulnerable to ZIKV infection utilizing a human placental explant model. We will characterize innate immune responses to ZIKV infection by determining infection rates under conditions of innate immune signaling blockade, assess for changes in toll-like receptor (TLR) and retinoic acid inducible-gene-I-like receptor (RLR) expression in placental cells exposed to ZIKV, and evaluate TLR- and RLR agonists for ability to suppress ZIKV infection. Our recent studies demonstrate robust expression of TLRs in first trimester villous cytotrophoblast that breaks down with advancing gestation. We will leverage our placental expertise in collaboration with virus experts to determine the consequences of ZIKV infection of placenta from early gestation, the time of highest risk for ZIKV-associated microcephaly. The proposed studies will improve our understanding of the conditions under which the placenta is able to resist ZIKV infection and transfer to the fetus."
"9323443","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a common cause of chronic liver disease in the United States. It encompasses both a fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The NASH Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) was established in 2002 to conduct research related to the clinical features, natural history and treatment of NAFLD in children and adults. The NASH CRN has been very productive in establishing and conducting network-wide clinical trials and numerous ancillary and pilot studies. Encouraged by its success, the NIDDK has issued RFA-DK-13-503 whose objective is to continue the NASH CRN for additional five years. The objectives of the NASH CRN during the next funding period are (a) to successfully complete three network-wide clinical trials and studies initiated during the last funding period. These include an observational longitudinal study of NAFLD in adults and children (NAFLD Database 1 and 2), a randomized double blind controlled therapeutic study of obeticholic acid in adults with NASH (FLINT, n=283), and a randomized double blind controlled therapeutic study of NAFLD in children (CyNCH, n=160). The NAFLD Database study will be amended to meet additional goals during the next funding period. These modifications may include extending the length of follow-up of those enrolled, consideration of a follow-up liver biopsy in a subset of patients without cirrhosis, adjudicated case-definition based outcomes assessment and enrolling carefully chosen controls without NAFLD for biomarker studies (b) to successfully complete a large set of pilot and ancillary studies that are ongoing, (c) to conduct additional therapeutic studies in adults and children with NASH as options currently available to treat NASH are quite limited, and (d) to initiate and complete additional ancillary studies based on extensive clinical material and biosamples collected thus far. These studies may focus on (but not limited to) natural history of NAFLD and NASH in children and adults, non-invasive assessment of disease severity (e.g., biomarker development, radiologic assessment) and disease pathogenesis (cytokine analyses, genome-wide association studies, systems biology). External expertise will be sought as needed. The NASH CRN will thus accomplish most of the NIH liver action plan for NAFLD."
"9356360","Project Summary and Abstract The burden of disease in sub-Saharan Africa is shifting rapidly towards non-communicable disease (NCD), of which cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause and hypertension the leading risk factor. A validated package of interventions for hypertension control and cardiovascular disease prevention exists, and has been piloted in select regions of Africa. However, the potential impact of this program on disease burden across populations remains unclear, because the sustainability of its implementation within established health systems remains unknown. We therefore propose to develop a pilot hypertension and CVD prevention program, based on the cardiovascular disease elements of the World Health Organization's Package for Essential Noncommunicable Disease (PEN-NCD) protocol [1,2], to successfully screen, diagnose, and control hypertension and other CVD risk factors as an element of the Community-Based Health Planning and Service (CHPS) program in Northern Ghana. We will develop and refine this approach based on the health beliefs of local communities, and the locally available health system building blocks, such as community health workers, outreach volunteers, and basic medication kits. Our research plan involves three phases. First, we will use multiple-decrement quantitative analyses, chart review and audits, structured provider observations, and provider written exams, to evaluate the capacity of CHPS' existing hypertension surveillance, screening, referral, and treatment programs. Second, we will use focus groups and structured interviews to identify gaps in this infrastructure and barriers to care. We will aim to identify barriers to hypertension care across health system building blocks. Third, we will use focus groups and structured interviews to identify solutions to identified barriers, which we will evaluate via structured observation of pilot test programs This analysis will aim to generate a complete pilot intervention to address hypertension and cardiovascular disease, based on WHO guidelines but adapted (in terms of use of health worker training; medication use; patient tracking; and all aspects of the health system) to the Navrongo context as delineated in the first two phases above. Our work will improve capacity for NCD care in sub-Saharan Africa in three ways. First, it will permit more accurate disease surveillance in a context in which even the extent of disease burden (let alone its root causes and means for control) remains a matter of debate. Second, it will generate a pilot regimen to determine whether a CHW-led primary care package can effectively help control the large and growing tide of preventable CVD in Ghana, a process that could lead to its implementation across the country. Thirdly, it will suggest the processes by which NCD programs such as WHO-PEN require modification across health systems, and hence how this program could be implemented nationwide across other contexts in Africa and developing countries."

The presence of a CHR syndrome in young adults is associated with heightened risk (~30%) for the later development of psychosis. The North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and other CHR studies have made substantial progress towards predicting psychosis, and in showing an accelerated reduction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) gray matter (GM) density in CHR converters from pre- to post-psychosis onset, but the mechanisms driving conversion remain elusive, partly because no studies include repeated measures prior to the onset of psychosis. In NAPLS2, we found that disrupted resting-state (rs) thalamo- cortical functional connectivity prior to psychosis predicts conversion and correlates with rate of GM decline, but we do not know if rs-dysconnectivity is progressive during the prodrome. Furthermore, in NAPLS2, plasma markers of pro-inflammatory cytokines at baseline predicted the rate of GM loss in converters; these same markers also correlated with rs-dysconnectivity. We do not yet know whether these inflammatory markers drive the changes in brain structure/function or are consequences of these changes. Similarly, higher levels of cortisol, and lower mismatch negativity predicted psychosis and the rate of PFC GM decline and were correlated with each other and with measures of rs-connectivity and cytokines.  This application is a competitive renewal for a nine-site, longitudinal study aimed at identifying the brain processes underlying the progression of the clinical syndromes that characterize the psychosis prodrome. The goals are: 1) to determine the pre-onset trajectories of GM decline and disrupted resting-state brain connectivity in CHR individuals who develop psychosis using MRI, and 2) to identify inflammatory and plasticity mechanisms associated with transition to psychosis. Over a two-year period, the study will repeatedly measure these indicators, and at the same time examine changes in physiological indices of brain function, social and cognitive functioning, and symptom progression. The multi-site collaboration will follow large CHR (n= 378) and demographically matched comparison (n= 162) samples that will undergo comprehensive assessments of biological and behavioral changes. This approach will answer important questions about the origins of the brain changes that give rise to psychosis and will provide insights into likely approaches to halting or mitigatig the pathological process and advance our understanding of risk prediction, both critical steps in prevention."
"9315800","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the MAPP Research Network is to provide new insights into underlying etiology, natural history, and risk factors of UCPPS in order to provide a translational foundation to facilitate future clinical intervention efforts and improv clinical management of the syndromes. The UCLA MAPP-II proposal builds on the significant insights gained from MAPP-I studies into symptom patterns, UCPPS subtypes and various biomarkers, including brain signatures. In addition to be continued analysis of data sets generated in MAPP-I, it aims to identify factors associated with and predictive of symptom change, in both UCPPS subjects and in a rodent model. The UCLA proposal addresses these goals in four specific aims, all of which, if funded, are expected to be addressed collaboratively in transMAPP studies: Aim 1. To conduct a symptom pattern study across the MAPP Research Network which will form the backbone for Aims 2 and 3. Aim 2. To determine functional and structural brain correlates of patient subgroups, symptom fluctuations, and natural history. Aim 3. To develop and apply enhanced functional assessments for UCPPS, including assessment of endogenous pain modulation systems. Aim 4. To evaluate central mechanisms underlying symptom fluctuations, including stress mechanisms and related molecular brain changes in a rodent model of UCPPS. It is expected that the proposed studies will provide an unprecedented wealth of data, which will facilitate major breakthroughs in our understanding of UCPPS pathophysiology and identification of novel treatment approaches."
"9346121","Parkinson?s disease and related synucleinopathies afflict 10% of those older than age 65. Since there are currently no effective treatments, it is essential that we find a way to prevent or treat these devastating neurodegenerative diseases. The pathological hallmark of synucleinopathies such as Parkinson?s disease is the deposition of insoluble aggregates of misfolded ?-synuclein; however, mounting evidence suggests that soluble aggregates of ?-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) are a key causal agent in synucleinopathies. An emerging concept in neurodegenerative disease research and diagnosis is that disease pathology overlaps or even forms a continuum of pathologies. For example, concomitance of ?-synuclein and tau pathology in Parkinson?s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies is not rare; in fact, several studies report co-localization of ?-synuclein and tau. Thus, it has been put forth that soluble aggregates of ?-synuclein and tau contribute to secondary symptoms and clinical heterogeneity in these dementing disorders and that ?-synuclein and tau interaction is essential for the full development of pathology and neurotoxicity. Despite the outstanding efforts of many investigators, the relationship between ?-synuclein and tau aggregation in synucleinopathies remains unresolved. Moreover, the role and mechanisms of neurotoxicity remain largely unknown. Finally, the ability to detect ?-synuclein and tau oligomers in early stage disease and exploit them as therapeutic targets for synucleinopathies remains largely unexplored. In this MPI, R01 proposal, we will test the exciting hypothesis that tau and ?-synuclein oligomers synergize to promote neurotoxicity. This project utilizes a diversity of state-of-the-art conceptual and technical approaches from a multidisciplinary and highly collaborative team to address the important problem of identifying mechanisms specific to ?-synuclein toxicity, the role of tau oligomerization and targeting these entities through immunotherapy. Aim 1 will test whether ?-synuclein and tau oligomers synergize to induce motor, learning, and memory deficits in vivo. Aim 2 will test whether ?-synuclein and tau synergize to promote neurotoxicity as well as investigate specific mechanisms. Aim 3 will determine the contribution of ?-synuclein posttranslational modifications to ?-synuclein and tau oligomer neurotoxicity. These aims integrate highly specialized transgenic animals, protein biochemistry, mass spectrometry-based proteomics, and Drosophila genetics. Our proposal, if successful, will provide much needed novel molecular insight into the mechanisms of neurotoxicity in synucleinopathies that may prove crucial in moving forward to a disease modifying therapy."

"9401945","Project Summary Approximately 10% of the world's adult population has chronic kidney disease (CKD) for which there are very few effective preventive or stabilizing therapeutic options. In addition, 30% of newly developed drugs are not advanced because of nephrotoxicity. We have developed efficient directed differentiation protocols to generate nephron progenitor cells (NPCs) and 3D kidney organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs). At present, however, there are no effective platforms that integrate these kidney cells and vascularized organoids within microphysiological systems in vitro to develop effective kidney models for interrogation of nephrotoxicity and drug efficacy. Our proposal unites expertise in kidney organoids and disease, microphysiological systems, and bioprinting led by three experienced investigators (Bonventre, Lee and Lewis) in a unique effort to create these needed model platforms. In Specific Aim 1 we will develop efficient processes to direct differentiation of hiPSCs into kidney podocytes, tubular epithelial cells, and endothelial cells endowed with differentiated features for integration into microphysiological analysis platforms (MAP) and bioprinted structures. We create genetic models of disease and reporter lines that signal differentiation characteristics to optimize differentiation protocols and to monitor physiological parameters. In Specific Aim 2 we will design, construct, and characterize an integrated kidney MAP to evaluate the function of hPSC-derived kidney podocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells as well as kidney organoids. We will also use this platform to create a model of a glomerulus that will have differentiated podocytes on an extracellular matrix (to mimic the glomerular basement membrane) and hiPSC-derived endothelial cells on the other side of the basement membrane. The MAP will be optimized to interrogate basic kidney biology and pathobiology of both non-genetic and genetic disease involving kidney cysts or podocyte injury and test responses to putative therapeutic agents. In Specific Aim 3 we will bioprint a 3D kidney model that contains convoluted proximal tubules, pericytes and endothelial-lined vascular structures with controlled, physiologically relevant system. Modeled tubules and vasculature will be perfused through a open lumens. The ECM composition will be optimized to support confluent epithelialization using proximal and distal tubule cells, podocytes, and endothelial cells derived from hiPSCs. We will characterize polarized drug uptake, toxicity, and vectorial transport through the interstitium (ECM) as well as cell-cell interactions among the epithelial cells, interstitium and endothelium-lined channels to create and validate vascularized kidney models composed of cells derived from healthy and patients with cystic disease that affects the tubule and glomerular disease that affects the podocyte. Our program, with well-established milestones, will result in novel models to test kidney toxicity and drug efficacy."

"9322869","ABSTRACT  Changes in reward system structure and function are thought to underlie many of the behavioral features, both positive and negative, that characterize adolescence. While increasing striatal response to reward during adolescence putatively supports positive and age typical behaviors such as greater exploration and peer affiliation, blunted striatal response to reward is observed in adolescent Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), maternally defined MDD-risk, and prospective worsening of depressive symptoms. Although it is clear that functional response to reward changes dramatically over normative development, and that blunted reward responding is linked to negative outcomes, it is unclear how depression risk may impact longitudinal trajectories of positive valence system function over adolescence. Understanding how and why maternally defined depression risk may interact with typical developmental processes could lead to a better understanding of the etiopathogenesis of depression and the development of prevention/intervention programs. To investigate these questions the proposed study aims to employ longitudinal functional neuroimaging methods to first examine whether blunted striatal reward responding is a consistent correlate of MDD-risk from childhood through adolescence (i.e. relates to the intercept rather than the slope of striatal reward response) or whether such blunting emerges/strengthens over development (i.e. relates to the rate of change in striatal reward response). Whether maternal neurobiological features, including striatal response to reward and structural integrity of reward-related white matter tracts, mediate relationships between maternal MDD history and offspring function will also be examined. To investigate these questions the proposed study capitalizes on an existing longitudinal data set where neural (fMRI) response to reward feedback was evaluated in a large sample of 8-14 year-old girls, with a second fMRI scan to be collected at a two-year follow up. Functional measures of maternal neural response to reward (fMRI) as well as white matter structural integrity (Diffusion Spectrum Imaging ? DSI) will also be collected at the two-year follow up, and are novel contributions of the proposed study. Analyses will focus on the never-depressed daughters of mothers with either a history of depression or without a history of any Axis I disorder. The proposed study will provide training in advanced neuroimaging techniques (DSI and fMRI), models of risk and developmental psychopathology, as well as advanced statistical techniques for both mediation and longitudinal analyses. This research will provide an enhanced understanding of a core dysfunctional mechanism in depression risk, reward responsiveness, and its trajectory across development.  "
"9280025","Collaboration and Service Project Summary/Abstract We have identified nineteen collaboration and service projects for the National Resource for Advanced NMR Technology BTRR. This set of projects encompasses an impressive portfolio of projects supported by the NIH. They also have the resources needed at their home institutions to make challenging and biomedically relevant samples and to gather preliminary data to inform the experiments they will undertake in our facility. Equally important, these projects will benefit from unique technologies developed in each of the TR&D projects. Many of the projects will use capabilities developed in two, or even three, of the TR&D areas. The projects are all distinguished by a clear need for improved sensitivity and resolution beyond what conventional NMR instru- mentation can provide. All the C&S PIs have a well-defined vision for what they can accomplish as the ultrasensitive cryoprobes (TR&D1), dynamic nuclear polarization technologies (TR&D2), and capabilities for the series connected hybrid (SCH) magnet (TR&D3) are made available through our user program. In support of the C&S projects we have three specific aims for the BTRR: 1) assist users in utilizing new technology developed through the BTRR; 2) develop and refine technology through active engagement with the user community; 3) broaden the user base through outreach and active recruitment of new users. C&S projects were selected to provide broad coverage of biomedical research areas which can benefit from our BTRR. In addition, many of them are already actively engaged users of our facilities, which gives us great confidence they will truly fill the role intended for C&S projects."
"9353806","OVERALL RESOURCE: Summary The Resource for Quantitative Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging is an interdepartmental and interdisciplinary Resource combining facilities of the F.M. Kirby Research Center for Functional Brain Imaging at the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI), the Center for Imaging Science (CIS) in the School of Engineering at Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and the group for Imaging Biostatistics in the Bloomberg School of Public Health at JHU. This Resource Center is dedicated to using its unique expertise to design novel MRI and MRS data acquisition and processing technology in order to facilitate the biomedical research of a large community of clinicians and neuroscientists in Maryland and throughout the USA, with a special focus on the changing brain throughout our life span, i.e. during neurodevelopment as well as during neurodegeneration. These NIH- funded collaborative projects have a continued need for the development of new quantitative technology to better achieve and further expand the aims in their grants, which focus on topics such as autism, impaired brain development, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, primary progressive aphasia, Huntington's disease and cancer. The F.M. Kirby Center is a leading magnetic resonance technology development center that has 3T and 7T state of the art scanners equipped with parallel imaging capabilities (8, 16, and 32-channel receive coils), and a dual transmit body coil at 3T. The 7T is to be extended with a 8-channel multi-transmit system with a compatible 32-channel coil. CIS is an interdisciplinary research center that brings together a diverse group of scientists whose work rests on theoretical advances in mathematics and statistics, traditional signal and systems processing, and information theory. This Center has an IBM supercomputer that is part of a national supercomputing infrastructure. The Department of Biostatistics at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has one of the largest groups of biostatisticians focusing on neuroimaging. This Department also boasts a world class computing environment with its high performance computing cluster. Our Resource combines a strong technical environment with unique expertise of the investigators and clinicians in our collaborative projects, who are continuously asking questions to improve technology for their studies in children, the elderly, and subjects with neurological and psychiatric disorders. These needs are reflected in the proposed developments in our four technical research and development (TR&D) projects. TR&D1 focuses on MR spectroscopy (MRS) assessment of tissue changes in metabolite levels; TR&D2 develops MRI methods for detection of glutamate, cerebral blood volume (CBV), flow (CBF), metabolic rate of oxygen (CMRO2), and tissue structure iron and myelin content as reflected in magnetic susceptibility parameters. In TR&D3, new statistical approaches are developed for studying functional connectivity. The methodologies of TR&Ds 1-3 are brought together in TR&D4, where multi-contrast brain atlases are being designed that can be used to study the measured parameters, while taking into account changes in the brain shape. Together with the collaborators we optimize the new approaches to turn them into practical products. The resource provides training in these new acquisition and processing technologies and has a longstanding history of disseminating them to other research centers and hospitals."
"9353813","TR&D 4. Algorithms for functional and anatomical brain analysis  Principal investigators:  Susumu Mori, Professor of Radiology Michael Miller, Professor of Biomedical Engineering SUMMARY  The overall objective of TR&D4 is to develop cutting-edge image analysis technologies that can integrate various anatomical representations (multi-manifold) of the brain based on multi-modal MRI that includes not only multiple MRI contrasts (e.g. T1, T2, diffusion, susceptibility imaging, CEST imaging) but also functional MRI (fMRI), physiological MRI (measures of cerebral blood volume, CBV, flow, CBF and oxygen metabolism, CMRO2), and MR spectroscopy (MRS) into a common anatomical framework. As TR&D 1-3 further develop new image acquisition and signal processing techniques, the richness of the modern MRI-based observations continues to grow with more contrasts, higher spatial dimensions, as well as the addition of a time axis, which eventually needs to be correlated with clinical features. For example, stratification of patients by anatomical, functional, and spectroscopic scans could play a crucial role in many collaborative projects for brain development, ADHD, schizophrenia, and Huntington's Disease. For neonatal, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, and primary progressive aphasia studies, anatomical and diffusion scan results need to be integrated over the longitudinal dimension. For certain applications, there are specific structures of interest such as the limbic system, for which detailed surface shape analysis based on high-resolution atlases are needed. The various image analysis tools we have developed in the past 15 years are now being used by investigators around the world. These tools are now widely distributed through www.mristudio.org with more than 9,000 registered users, the number of processed data sets in our server exceeded 10,000 in 2014 alone, a number that is still increasing. For the next five years, our specific aims are: Aim 1: Integration of diffeomorphic brain mapping and multi-atlas based image feature analysis We will integrate cutting-edge multi-atlas fusion algorithms into our LDDMM-based pipelines and develop a new image segmentation platform through the integration of tools developed in Aim 2. We will also continue to develop brain atlas resources through continued development of multi-atlas libraries that covers the entire age range. Aim 2: Integrative analysis for multi-contrast and multi-manifold mapping of the whole brain anatomy Tools to integrate multiple image contrasts and multiple shape objects will be developed for advanced analysis, which will include the modern MRI data developed in TR&D 1-3, high-resolution atlases based on 7T/11.7T scanners, and tools for time dependent anatomical change analysis. Aim 3: Deployment and Maintenance of Cloud-based service system Toward the sunset of this National Resource Grant, it is important to establish a sustainable platform for dissemination and services. In 2015, we introduced a new platform-free web-based cloud system as our new service approach, which drastically reduces the burden for users and developers. We bridge publicly available supercomputing resources and users who need the computational power. This platform will also be used to deploy software programs developed in TR&D 1?3 including MRS, rs-fMRI, QSM, CBV, CBF, and CMRO2 analyses."
"9312947","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the Administrative Core of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to develop and implement an administrative structure that integrates key functions of the Center. The Center management, day-to-day operation, and general oversight will be the responsibility of the Leadership Committee, which consists of the Center Director, three Associate Directors, and a Center Manager. The leaders have independent research programs and bring complementary skills to the Committee. Each Associate Director is responsible for either the Enrichment Series, Clinical Component, or Pilot and Feasibility Program. They meet weekly to review the operation of the Center. Six to 8 times a year, members of the Leadership Committee meets as an Executive Committee, which also includes the Directors of the biomedical Cores and one DHC investigator representing the membership at large. The function of the Executive Committee is to assist the leadership in reviewing Core utilization, provide support with scientific and overall directions of the DHC, and help with conflicts arising from membership applications. Once a year, or more often, the Executive Committee meets with the Internal Advisory Board to review strategic needs of the Center and maintain institutional engagement and support to foster digestive disease research in the medical center. This operational structure has been very successful since the creation of the DHC. Overseeing the strategic operation of the DHC is an External Advisory Board (EAB), which is comprised of four extramural scientific leaders in the field. The EAB monitors and evaluates ongoing research and programmatic directions of the Center, reviews, identifies, and recommends support for the most meritorious P/F applications, and assesses the effectiveness of the biomedical Cores. The EAB prepares and submits an annual report to the Chair of Pediatrics and Director Research of the Research Foundation, who holds the primary reporting authority and oversight of the Center. This structure has been very effective over the past 9 years of the DHC existence, has maintained the DHC as a real catalyst of scientific discoveries, has ensured the delivery of state-of-the-art services that meet the needs of Center investigators, has implemented successful enrichment and P/F programs, and has fostered an exceptional level of engagement and support from Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center to be real catalysts of discoveries in digestive disease."
"9201250","PROJECT SUMMARY  The goal of this proposal is to develop assays for cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity using magnetic 3D bioprinting. Both cardiotoxicity and hepatotoxicity are critical areas for safety testing, and in need of more accurate in vitro screens to prevent costly market withdrawals. However, current in vitro options are lacking in throughput and representation of native tissue environments. This proposal uses magnetic 3D bioprinting to create 3D in vitro culture models that mimic native tissue. The principle behind magnetic 3D bioprinting is the magnetization of cells and their printing using magnetic forces. This method is rapid and easy to use, and escapes the technical issue of other 3D culture models that limit its use for high-throughput screening. In Phase I, a general toxicity assay, the BiO Assay, was developed using magnetically 3D bioprinted spheroids. This Phase II builds on that success, by developing this cytotoxic assay for cardiomyocytes and hepatocytes, then further developing tissue-specific functional assays to determine the effect of compounds on tissue function. For cardiomyocytes, a beating assay will be developed to assay a compound's effect on beating, while for hepatocytes, an assay for cytochrome P450 induction/inhibition will be developed to assay a compound's effect on metabolism. In combination with other assays, such as LC-MS and fluorescent calcium signaling assays, our assays will offer high-content and high-throughput solutions to study both cytotoxicity and functional toxicity. This work aids NIEHS in its goal of finding in vitro solutions for toxicity screening that are high-throughput and representative of native tissue environments. The end result of this proposed work is a full suite of assays to study a compound's cardiotoxic and hepatotoxic effects."

This BTRR will be housed and will function in alliance with the National High Magnetic Field Lab (NHMFL) that is funded by the National Science Foundation Division of Material Research and the State of Florida. The NHMFL is a consortium of three institutions: Florida State University, University of Florida and Los Alamos National Lab. The facilities that form the basis for the TR&Ds in this proposal are NHMFL NMR facilities at UF in Gainesville (TR&D1) and at FSU in Tallahassee (TR&Ds 2 & 3). Consequently, this BTRR will be hosted by an extensive and well-functioning collaboration between FSU and UF that has developed over more than 25 years. The three PIs for this BTRR have more than a decade of experience partnering together to form an exemplary NMR user facility for the nation. This BTRR will represent a unique NIH Resource that develops novel technological NMR capabilities for the national biomedical research community. NMR is an exceptionally versatile tool with opportunities not only to look at many different nuclei, but even more combinations of nuclei and even more and varied experiments with any given set of nuclei. Managing the community's interests (demands) for new technology is challenging ? we know because the three of us mediate this discussion on such topics frequently. The probes that will be developed here represent major technological efforts. The team of three PIs (Brey, Long & Cross) coupled with our DBPs represents a team that can evaluate and prioritize the probe parameters that must be optimized and what parameters can be relaxed without sacrificing the highest priority science. This is why we have three PIs and will have weekly conference calls and why we have such a strong set of DBPs for each TR&D.  In addition to managing the technological goals the operations of the TR&D facilities for DBPs and C&Ss will be managed by the PDs, the same as the PIs with the addition of Merritt. These PDs in combination with a group of post-docs and current NHMFL staff will facilitate the user experience by the DBPs and C&Ss. Research at the frontiers of the technology always brings excitement and frustration, frustration for the user and frustration for the staff. By having the technology team in house, repair time for instrumentation can be minimized. Having multiple probes for the spectrometers also minimizes spectrometer down time.  Staff will generate monthly fiscal reports for review and approval by the PIs so that the financial resources are managed effectively. An External advisory committee will review annually the fiscal reports as will as the entire operation of the BTRR."

"9316603","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD) includes symptoms related to bladder storage, emptying, pain, and infection. LUTD is a highly prevalent chronic medical condition that disproportionately affects women and contributes to overall morbidity. Based on population growth and prevalence estimates, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) and conditions are expected to affect more than 43 million women over the next 30 years. The cost to society for LUTS and related issues such as falls and lost productivity is estimated to be over $65 billion per year. LUTS also interfere with participation in social and physical activities, which affects quality of life and also contributes negatively to other chronic medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and depression. Clearly, there is high individual and societal impact, however many women do not understand these implications, and even symptomatic women often don't seek treatment. This is likely due to a focus on disease treatment without adequate understanding of what behaviors affect LUTS development and progression. The PLUS consortium will establish the evidence base necessary to conduct future prevention intervention studies in girls and women. The objective of our application is to demonstrate how we can build the knowledge base for bladder health using Ecological Systems Theory as a guiding framework, an approach that addresses risk factors at the individual, family/peer, and community levels. Health outcomes are affected by a variety of complex and interrelated factors both at the individual and environmental level. The majority of current evidence for bladder health and risk factors for LUTS is based on individual traits, and therefore most interventions have focused on a single stratum of the ecologic model without consideration of contextual targets within other levels. Utilizing existing databases, focus groups, and longitudinal cohort studies, we will consider issues including biologic factors, behaviors, knowledge, environment, and health services that will determine who is at risk to develop LUTS and how early symptoms are addressed and managed. A multi-level approach is essential to any sustainable, effective program; hence, an ecological framework that accounts for multiple contextual factors is critical to identifying and ultimately changing behaviors that lad to LUTS and associated health outcomes. The multidisciplinary team we have assembled for the Yale Bladder Health Clinical Center includes experts in LUTS care and research in addition to investigators with expertise in health behaviors and epidemiologic studies across the age range of females including smoking, vaccination, obesity, prenatal care, urinary tract infection, and disability. Investigators have recruited female patients both from primary care clinics and the community into numerous longitudinal studies, and their approach to chronic disease prevention will shed new light on the study of risk and protective factors for LUTS. This innovative collaboration between clinicians and prevention scientists will help redefine LUTS as a public health issue and ultimately improve the long term health and wellness of millions of girls and women."
"9296166","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Transgender people are a diverse group of individuals whose gender identity differs from their sex assigned at birth. They express their gender-variant identity in various ways and through a multitude of self- labels, both within and outside of binary conceptualizations of sex/gender as either male or female, man or woman, masculine or feminine. While public awareness of this diversity has grown, our understanding of transgender people's experience is limited by a lack of systematic research on their identity development. Health inequities documented among the U.S. transgender population include depression (44%), suicidal ideation (54%) and attempts (31%), anxiety (33%), smoking (36%), and HIV infection (12% based on self- report; 28% on testing). Social stigma attached to gender nonconformity has been proposed as a major contributing factor to these health inequities. Previous research found that the vast majority of transgender individuals experienced discrimination. Much of the data, however, is limited by the use of small convenience samples of transgender women with a history of sex work, recruited from AIDS and social service agencies. The goal of this study is to move beyond these limitations by using purposive, venue-based sampling to recruit a broad, diverse sample of transgender people in 3 U.S. cities--New York, San Francisco, and Atlanta-and enroll them into a mixed-method longitudinal study to test an adaptation of the minority stress model, investigating vulnerability, risk and resilience in the context of identity development. The aims of the study are: (1) To describe the process of transgender identity development based on qualitative lifeline interviews with a sample of 90 transgender individuals ages 16 and older, and identify periods of acute vulnerability and characteristics of resilience; (2) Informed by findings from Aim 1, to refine a model combining identity development, minority stress, and resilience, and to develop/adapt measures to assess the model's key constructs; (3) To test the model of resilience in a cohort of transgender individuals (N = 480) stratified by city, gender, and age, and follow them over time (baseline, 1-, 2-, and 3-year follow up interviews); and (4) To triangulate qualitative and quantitative data on identity development and minority stress processes in order to inform the future development and testing of intervention strategies aimed at fostering resilience and reducing stigma and discrimination. By achieving these aims, this study will make a significant advance in scientific knowledge about gender identity development, minority stress processes (enacted stigma, felts stigma, concealment, shame and their impact on health and psychosocial adjustment), minority coping (on an individual as well as community level), and the development of resilience over time. The study is innovative in its focus on an understudied minority population, the application of the lifeline interview method to this population, and the adaptation and testing of the minority stress model within the context of transgender identity development."
"9311302","PROJECT SUMMARY ? VDDRC ENRICHMENT The Enrichment Program provides critical mechanisms to support the overall goals of the VDDRC via the following Specific Aims: 1) To foster the scientific and career development of members; 2) To expand research tools used by VDDRC members to pursue studies in the realm of digestive disease; and 3) To disseminate knowledge gained from the presence of the VDDRC. To achieve these goals, the VDDRC has incorporated several elements into the Enrichment component: A) the Research Seminar Series; B) the new Academy of Investigators; C) the Enrichment Training (mini-sabbatical) Program; and D) the Annual Retreat. To catalyze member scientific development and interactions, the VDDRC Research Seminar Series was initiated in 2002. This series is a vehicle for prominent local, national, and international investigators to present lectures related to topics within the VDDRC Research Domains. Institutional and endowed support over the last funding period ($94,500) sponsored complementary research symposia and lectures within the GI Division targeting the research interests of VDDRC members. To train the next generation of GI researchers, we have now created the VDDRC Academy of Investigators, a program in which junior investigators perform innovative research with VDDRC support, and acquire important career development tools. This new component is directed by Dr. Alyssa Hasty, a former VDDRC P & F recipient and Young Investigator Awardee, and will now receive $220,000 from VUMC over the next 5 years. To provide members with the opportunity to expand their research capabilities, the VDDRC Enrichment Training (mini-sabbatical) Program supports members' leaves to work in another laboratory for either the acquisition of new techniques or to establish a new model related to digestive disease research. This program, which is open to all VDDRC members, also permits reverse visits for investigators to come to Vanderbilt to work in a lab or with a research group on developing digestive disease-related technologies or models. The annual VDDRC retreat format is designed to disseminate research findings of our members and includes a symposium featuring internal speakers and current P & F recipients, a keynote speaker, and a poster session (ePosters and standard posters), which provides robust interactions among senior investigators, junior faculty, and trainees. Scholarships for VDDRC Cores are awarded to the best posters as judged by Program leaders."
"9471929","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alphaherpesviruses are pathogens that proficiently invade the nervous system of an immunocompetent host. Spread of these neuroinvasive herpesviruses from sensory neurons to the eye, brain or from mother to newborn, are significant causes of morbidity and mortality. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) are representative members of the two genuses of mammalian neuroinvasive herpesviruses (simplexviruses & varicelloviruses). These viruses rely on spread to the nervous system to establish life-long latent infections, yet very little is known regarding the molecular mechanisms that underlie this remarkable trait. The UL37 protein is a conserved structural component of the alphaherpesvirus virion. Our lab recently identified three highly conserved surface-exposed regions in the amino terminal half of this protein. As part of my preliminary data for this proposal I demonstrated that pseudorabies virus (PRV) mutated in one of these regions, designated R2, replicates to near wild-type titers in epithelial cells, however fails to invade the  host nervous system due to a defect in sustained retrograde transport within the axon. This proposal is founded on the hypothesis that UL37 performs critical effector functions that are required during neural delivery. The experiments proposed will examine the mechanism by which this mutant is defective at long distance axon transport as well as determine if the effector  functions of the R2 region are conserved in the human pathogen, HSV-1. The R2 mutant has the capacity to generate a robust immune response due to its replication in peripheral cells. This property in combination with the loss in neuroinvasive capabilities makes the R2 mutant uniquely suited to advance the development of live-attenuated vaccines against both human and veterinary alphaherpesvirus infection by preventing latency establishment."
"9310371","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) was developed by Robert Koch in 1890 and still is the method of choice in the diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB). TST measures an in vivo cellular reaction mediated by Th1 cells at the site of tuberculin injection. Although TST detects previous exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), it presents low specificity and is not capable to differentiate latent infection from active TB disease. Few years ago, the identification of highly specific RD1 region in Mtb genome drove the development of new in vitro TB specific tests. The commercially available QuantiFERON(r) TB Gold IN TUBE6 is an example of such in vitro tests (also known as IGRA). IGRA detects IFN-? released from lymphocytes after in vitro incubation with Mtb antigens. As opposed to TST, IGRA offer enhanced specificity and are not influenced by cross-reactivity to BCG and other non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). However, it is still controversial whether IGRA can replace TST as the diagnostic test of choice. Although IGRA is, by definition, more specific than TST, several studies have reported an elevated frequency of IGRA reversions and conversions7-15 as well as discordance between IGRA and TST 4, 16, 17. We, recently, reported a high discordance rate (21%) between the two tests, with the majority of discordance coming from HHC with TST positive and IGRA negative results. These findings18 allow us to differentiate Mtb-exposed individuals from uninfected (TST negative, IGRA negative), new infection (TST positive/converted, IGRA negative) and remote infection (TST and IGRA positive). Using samples from these three groups, we propose to dissect the mechanism for TST/IGRA discordancy and to identify biomarkers predictive of new infection. We posit that in the in-vivo TST, recruitment of antigen-specific T cells and T regulatory cells (Tregs) to the injection site i temporally segregated. Whereas in the in-vitro IGRA concurrent presence of antigen-specific T cells and Tregs attenuates antigen-specific T cell expansion and attendant IFN-¿ secretion, leading to differences in sensitivity and a delayed IGRA conversion. Our finding of TST and IGRA discordant subjects is a significant aspect of our proposal since without this group we would have missed identification of biomarkers of new infection. Comparative gene expression analysis of stimulated whole blood cells from the three groups of subjects will allow the identification of genes that are only expressed in newly and recently-infected contacts, with the potential to provide biomarker(s) that can distinguish these two groups of LTBI with the highest risk of progression to disease from the larger group of LTBI with remote infection. The knowledge gained with this proposal will help with the elucidation of immunological basis of TST/IGRA discordance, which in turn may allow the improvement of in-vitro TB diagnostics. Another significant contribution is that the biomarkers of new infection will permit distinction between new and remote infection, allowing identification of newly infected individuals for prophylaxis."
"9306051","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests support for the continuation of a research training program in academic nephrology, now under the directorship of Dr. Martin Pollak, Chief, Nephrology Division, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) and Professor of Medicine, Harvard Medical School (HMS). Continued support is requested for six trainees who will spend at least two years in the training program. Most candidates will have received the MD degree or the MD-PhD degree prior to entry but prospective trainees with a PhD and a background in a relevant scientific discipline are also considered. The major criterion for selection is evidence of an interest, ability and commitment for a career in investigative nephrology. Research activities span basic and translational investigations.

"9302836","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Peripheral neuropathy is the most common complication of diabetes and will afflict over half of the 25 million Americans who currently suffe from diabetes. There is no FDA-approved therapy to prevent neuropathy or reverse the distal degenerative neuropathy already present in many newly diagnosed diabetic patients. Recent clinical and experimental studies have emphasized that retraction of the peripheral terminals of small sensory axons as an early feature of diabetic neuropathy. This offers a window of opportunity to halt or reverse the dying-back of peripheral terminals before neuronal death. We have recently discovered that muscarinic M1 receptor antagonists can enhance axonal outgrowth from adult rat sensory neurons grown under defined in vitro conditions and also prevent distal neuropathy in diabetic rodents. This prompts us to propose that adult peripheral neurons are under constant cholinergic constraint that moderates the growth capacity of axon terminals and that manipulating this endogenous system offers a novel therapeutic approach to reversing early diabetic neuropathy. We will investigate the mechanism of cholinergic constraint in adult sensory neurons and determine whether diabetes alters this process as part of the pathogenic mechanism of diabetic neuropathy. We will also demonstrate the therapeutic potential of manipulating this endogenous cholinergic constraint mechanism to reverse established distal neuropathy in diabetic rodents and use corneal confocal microscopy to illustrate that preclinical efficacy of a therapeutic can be rapidly translated to demonstrable efficacy in diabetic subjects with peripheral neuropathy."
"9209230","Abstract The overall goal of this new scientific core is to provide centralized influenza virology support to enhance the overall structure-function analysis and immunogen discovery activities of the program. Specifically, Core B, housed in the NIAID-Regional Biocontainment Laboratory (RBL) at Duke, will provide comprehensive influenza virus stock propagation and high-throughput binding and neutralization assay support. The RBL at Duke is fully approved for BSL2, BSL3, Select Agent and high path avian influenza Risk Group 3 work and is as a multi-disiplanary research support facility at Duke constructed with federal funds to support the NIAID biodefense agenda or other NIAID approved biomedical research activities. These unique services are not available through other facilities at Duke or Harvard. Proposed Core B activities will be specifically utilized by all projects in this renewal P01. The aims of the Virology Core are: 1) Influenza Strain Collections - develop, maintain and provide a broad panel of purified influenza viruses; and 2) Influenza Humoral Response Monitoring - perform centralized influenza HA binding and microneutralization assays (e. g. human, mouse, and NHP specimens). The inclusion of this new Virology Core will provide a common set of reagents and assays for mechanistic analysis of host immune response for all three projects. Critical to the Core aims and overall goal is an ongoing commitment to development of new assays, quality control monitoring and consultation with all project leaders to anticipate and meet the needs of the investigative teams in a safe, compliant and efficient manner."
"9302782","PROJECT SUMMARY Microfluidic devices have been successfully used in biological assays, especially for assays involving bacteria and cells. While important studies involving bacteria and cells are still in progress in many research laboratories, many devices are now being developed such that tissues, and even organs, can be cultivated on these devices for more realistic biological studies. For nearly a decade, the PI has been culturing endothelial cells in microfluidic devices and investigating the interactions of the endothelium (as a vessel wall tissue) with a flowing stream of blood components such as red blood cells (RBCs) and platelets. In this application, the investigative team wishes to expand upon these tissues to include components of pancreatic tissue (?-cells, the cells responsible for secreting the well-known biological peptide, insulin). One of the major objectives of this application is to measure and understand cell-to-cell and tissue-to-tissue communication between the ?-cells, the bloodstream, and the vessel wall (endothelium). Unfortunately, it has been shown that affecting ?-cells by knockout or knockdown approaches often adversely affects the cell as a whole, thus making it difficult to distinguish key factors in the biological pathways. In this application, the investigative team will develop a novel platform based on 3D-printing of fluidic devices hosting membrane inserts with modified pores that selectively captures molecular messengers traveling through the bloodstream from one tissue to another. We will also develop a new that enables intravenous (IV) injections of drug therapy candidates into a flowing stream of blood or blood components to bridge results into a full in vivo study using animal models of type 1 diabetes (T1D). We hypothesize that the development of this novel platform for studying cell-to-cell and tissue-to-tissue communication can be used as a bridge to in vivo studies involving a possible additional replacement therapy for people with T1D."
"9280963","Admin Core  Eva Nogales  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   Visualizing the structures of biological molecular machines is crucial for a mechanistic  understanding of cellular function. While X-ray crystallography can provide structures for some  of these complexes, crystallization precludes general applicability, especially when the amount of sample  is limited or the sample is heterogeneous. Cryo-EM is ideally suited to study large assemblies, in  multiple states, and using minute amounts of sample. This methodology has just entered a new  era with the use of high-end electron microscopes coupled to new direct electron detection cameras  that is leading to higher resolution and faster turn-around of structures. These new capabilities rely on  very expensive equipment and associated service contracts that make them practical only in the context  of a group of investigators that can share costs. Equally importantly, the use of this equipment requires  dedicated personnel to provide daily up-keep and high-level training for a large number of users. This  personnel requirement extends beyond the microscope and its auxiliary instruments, to IT support  personnel who maintain the hardware and software required to handle and process the large influx of  data generated by the new detectors operated in automatic mode.   As the sophistication of the microscopes and the image analysis increases, and the applicability of  the technique expands, a community of scientists with exceptional expertise and frequent intellectual  exchanges is required to make cryo-EM research effective, and increase productivity and impact. These  exchanges are particularly important at a junction when a significant influx of new researchers and  biological systems are coming into the cryo-EM field from other areas in biochemistry and structural  biology. These researchers benefit tremendously from existing expertise in cryo-EM around them, while  they can provide invaluable biochemical help to traditional researchers in the cryo-EM field that are in the  process of expanding their systems of studies and become limited by the availability and behavior of the  sample.   This administrative core supports all different needs of the participating members, and  promotes collaboration and exchanges among them, so that the overall outcome is greater than the sum  of the parts. In addition to the four projects and technical Core that constitute the sections of this  proposal, support extends to a significant number of associated, independently funded projects in  Berkeley that include a substantial level of electron microscopy-based research and rely to some  extent on resources supported by the PPG. Furthermore, the support provided by the administrative  core also allows the participating members to get involved in collaborations with other investigators  concerning projects that at various times may need to complement research with advanced EM  capabilities not available elsewhere on Campus or at LBNL, or often to explore new directions. The  supported infrastructure facilitates exploratory studies that sometimes become more significant projects,  substantially increasing productivity beyond the official research components."
"9473903","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Adult-onset leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids and pigmented glia (ALSP), is a rare, autosomal dominant, neurodegenerative disorder that is characterized by adult-onset dementia with motor impairments and epilepsy. ALSP encompasses two similar diseases previously known as hereditary diffuse leukoencephalopathy with axonal spheroids (HDLS) and familial pigmentary orthochromatic leukodystrophy (POLD). The disease is caused by dominant mutations in the colony stimulating factor-1 receptor gene (CSF1R) resulting in loss of function, or of expression, of one allele. We have identified the heterozygous Csf1r+/- mouse as a model of ALSP. Csf1r+/- mice exhibit cognitive and sensorimotor deficits and depression- and anxiety- like behavior characteristic of early ALSP. MRI of Csf1r+/- brains reveals similarities to the radiologic changes in ALSP. Histopathological examination indicates neuronal loss, neuronal degeneration with presence of axonal spheroids and microgliosis, that are characteristic of the human disease. It is not known whether developmental deficits contribute to ALSP, nor whether loss of a single copy of the Csf1r gene in neurons and/or microglia is most critical for disease pathogenesis. Furthermore, there are no effective treatment options for ALSP. Our mouse model of ALSP will enable these questions to be addressed, early detection methods identified and novel treatment approaches instituted.  The Overall Aim is to utilize our mouse model of ALSP to determine the contributions of development, aging, microglial and neuronal lineages to disease pathogenesis and to explore therapeutic strategies based on these findings. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine the nature and cellular origins of developmental abnormalities in Csf1r haploinsufficient mice. The nature and timing of the appearance of histopathologic changes in the developing brains of Csf1r+/- mice, will be examined, the role of Csf1r haploinsufficiency in the microglial and/or neuronal lineages assessed and regulation by inappropriately elevated cytokines elucidated. In Specific Aim 2, we will determine the necessity of microglial and/or neuronal regulation by the CSF-1R for disease development by genetic deletion of a single Csf1r allele in the microglial and/or neuronal lineages of mice. In Specific Aim 3, we will identify targets for the treatment of ALSP.  The proposed studies are relevant not only for our understanding of ALSP, but also with respect to other neurodegenerative disorders in which neuronal cell survival and microglial function are critical. They will also directly contribute to our understanding of the roles of CSF-1R signaling n neuronal development and the regulation of microglia."
"9385589","This is a renewal application to RFA-HL-17-018 to propose that Division of Blood and Marrow Transplantation (BMT) at Stanford University continue as a Core Clinical Center for the BMT Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN). Stanford's Program will perform about 380 adult transplants in 2016 including autologous and allogeneic transplants using cells from matched and mismatched related and unrelated donors, cord blood units, ex vivo manipulated cell products and genetically modified cells. Stanford's BMT Program participates in basic, and clinical research as a single institution, and within regional, national and international consortia. The division is supported by a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Program Project Grant with over 27 years of funding of basic scientific research, and clinical translational trials that advance the field. The Program is strengthened by highly experienced biostatics and data management groups, and a cGMP-compliant, FACT and CLIA certified Cellular Therapy Facility for routine cell processing and the development of investigational cellular therapies. The Program is a high accrual BMT CTN center and has enrolled 320 patients to 16 CTN studies. In the past granting period, Stanford investigators served as Chair of the BMT CTN Steering Committee, Chair to the Lymphoma Symposium Committee, and have been members on five CTN committees and one Task Force. Stanford will continue to leverage the capabilities of its Program to support the research goals of the CTN. It is our collective mission to advance the field of BMT for patients with rare and difficult to treat blood diseases through high quality multi-center clinical trials. The goal of the proposed protocol in the current application is to determine if a novel strategy can reduce the risk of developing chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and thereby improve upon traditional allogeneic BMT. We propose a randomized phase 3 clinical trial where the active comparator is Ibrutinib starting 90 days after transplant and the control arm is no additional cGVHD prevention strategy. This study builds upon our prior preclinical and clinical work with this agent for the treatment and prevention of cGVHD. The primary outcome measure will be the rate of steroid requiring cGVHD by 18 months after transplant. Based on an aggregate of data, we hypothesize that Ibrutinib will reduce cGVHD development due to its ability to block B cell activation via irreversible inhibition of Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) and its ability to block T helper subset activation from inhibition of IL-2 inducible T cell kinase (ITK). The Stanford BMT program is committed to continued participation in BMT CTN trials, contributing concepts for consideration by the Network, and participating in Network committees and citizenship activities. !"
"9269984","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In two recent papers published in Science, we have demonstrated that public sector scale-up of ART in rural South Africa led to (i) large increases in adult life expectancy and (ii) significant declines in HIV infection risk, both measured at the population level (Bor et al. 2013; Tanser et al. 2013). And yet: HIV incidence and mortality rates remain unacceptably high in this HIV-endemic setting. In particular, young women (aged 15-30) remain at extremely high risk of HIV acquisition and more effective prevention programming is urgently needed for this group. Moreover, while the mass provision of free ART in public sector facilities in South Africa has dramatically reduced HIV-related mortality for both men and women, HIV-infected men are benefitting to a far lesser extent than women, because men are far less likely to link to HIV care. If the UNAIDS 90-90-90 targets are to be realized the gender gap in ART access has got to be closed. The two deficiencies in current HIV programs - continued high HIV incidence in women and comparatively low ART access in men - are inextricably linked. For successful treatment-as prevention, it is urgent that those large numbers of HIV-infected men - who are currently not benefitting from ART and who are infecting young women - are started on ART. Existing evidence and preliminary data from this community suggest that increased HIV testing and linkage to care can be successfully achieved through a combination of home-based HIV testing and financial incentives for both HIV testing and linkage to care. In this proposal we seek to reduce young female HIV incidence and male HIV-related mortality through a once-off, two-stage financial incentive to encourage HIV testing and linkage to HIV treatment in a real- world setting along. We will supplement this with some elements of motivational counselling and develop gender-sensitive approaches which draw on existing values and norms for men and for women. Following development we will implement the intervention in one third of the 42 communities contained in the Africa Centre's HIV surveillance area. Using a difference-in-differences design within an implementation science framework we will leverage the statistical power gained through a decade's long HIV surveillance and will compare the change in male viral load, male mortality and female incidence (15-30 years of age) pre and post intervention for residents of communities who receive and who do not receive the intervention respectively. Participants will then be followed up routinely through the Africa Centre's ongoing population-based HIV surveillance for three years. The results of this work will directly inform the development and targeting of prevention efforts in the context of generalized ART coverage."
"9278308","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons critically control voluntary movement, reward, and mood-related behaviors, and their degeneration/dysfunction is associated with major brain disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD) and schizophrenia. Thus, it is critical to understand molecular mechanisms underlying development, survival, and function of mDA neurons in health and disease. During the last funding cycle, we investigated the regulatory networks of key extrinsic factors and intrinsic transcription factors that critically control mDA neuronal development, focusing on the role and regulation of Pitx3. We found that Wnt1-Lmx1a form an autoregulatory pathway leading to induction of key transcription factors, Nurr1 and Pitx3. Notably, these studies revealed that two major pathways controlling mDA neuronal development (i.e., Shh-FoxA2 and Wnt1-Lmx1a) merge on Nurr1, highlighting Nurr1's essential role(s) for mDA neuron development/ maintenance. Indeed, recent studies showed that Nurr1 is critical not only for the development and long-term maintenance of mDA neurons (by transactivation function) but also for their protection from inflammation-induced death (through transrepression of inflammatory genes). Nurr1 is an orphan nuclear receptor and is known as a ligand-independent constitutively active nuclear receptor. Strikingly, however, we recently identified small molecules that can directly interact with the ligand binding domain of Nurr1 stimulating its contrasting dual functions; furthe activating the mDA neuronal function and further transrepressing expression of inflammatory genes in microglia. Based on these promising data identifying potential synthetic ligands/agonists of Nurr1, we hypothesize that Nurr1 may be an adopted nuclear receptor and that there may exist an endogenous Nurr1 ligand. Furthermore, Nurr1's diverse functions (e.g., transactivation, transrepression, or no apparent function) appear to depend upon the cellular context, which may be determined by cell-specific Nurr1-interacting factor(s). To address these hypotheses, we will systematically investigate the contrasting dual functions of Nurr1 in the absence and in the presence of agonist molecules and will identify and characterize multiprotein complexes associated with Nurr1 in different cellular contexts and the putative endogenous ligand(s). Our proposal is highly novel and innovative and will shed new insights into the functional roles of Nurr1 in mDA neurons, potentially leading to a paradigm-shift of our understanding of Nurr1's functional roles on mDA neurobiology and future therapeutic development of DA-related brain disorders."
"9483098","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a well-established neurosurgical therapy for multiple neurological and psychiatric disorders. In DBS, an electrode is stereotactically guided to a target cerebral nucleus and high frequency (~130 Hz) electrical stimulation is delivered through a pacemaker-like subcutaneous stimulating device. It is most commonly employed in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), generally in cases where other medical therapies have become inadequate or dyskinesias have become intolerable. When applied for the symptomatic treatment of PD, the subthalamic nucleus (STN) is frequently targeted, often resulting in a marked reduction in several hallmark PD symptoms, including resting tremor and rigidity. However, despite these benefits, many parkinsonian symptoms are frequently refractory to, or may worsen during STN-DBS. The STN is both anatomically heterogeneous and fiber-dense, and thus there is a high likelihood of recruitment of off-target circuits during STN-DBS, even with accurate electrode placements. A better understanding of how DBS exerts its therapeutic effects will allow optimization of this procedure to enhance therapeutic outcomes and reduce unwanted side-effects. The proposed project aims to address three critical, yet elusive questions of: 1) which neural circuits represent on- and off-target STN DBS effects, 2) whether selective optogenetic stimulation of STN neurons ameliorate parkinsonian motor deficits, and 3) which neural circuits are necessary for therapeutic STN-DBS. To these ends, we will use state-of-the-art functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI), electrophysiology, optogenetics, and behavioral assessment to dissect therapeutic DBS circuitry in an animal model of PD, in which the amelioration of motor deficits are strongly DBS-dependent. Our central hypotheses are that: 1) on- and off-target DBS exhibit behavior- correlated, distinct brain activity and connectivity patterns, 2) high frequency optogenetic stimulation of the STN cell bodies mimics STN-DBS therapy and suppresses pathological oscillatory activity, and 3) suppressing pivotal circuit elements using optogenetics during therapeutic DBS attenuates motor deficit rescue, and thus allowing effective therapeutic DBS circuits to be separated from DBS side effects. Our group has extensive experience in DBS-fMRI studies in rodents. Our co-investigators are also leaders in understanding and continuing development of DBS, optogenetics, and brain network analysis approaches. Together, we are in the unique position to undertake this much-needed line of research. This project will provide novel insights into DBS mechanisms, and lay a foundation to establish new DBS treatment targets and stimulus paradigms for a wide variety of neurological and psychiatric disorders."
"9290350","PROJECT SUMMARY Inferring the demographic history of a population is an important task in population genetics. Although several methods are available for this task, how to take advantage of large sample size of whole genome sequence data and provide accurate estimation of demographic history remains an open question. We propose several approaches to overcome the shortcomings of existing methods and specifically improve their accuracy and scalability for large sample size and whole genome sequence data. The resulting methods will be applied to the whole genome sequences of the genotype-rich human populations such as the TOPMED European American cohorts (~30,000 individuals) and Icelander whole genome sequence data (2,636 individuals), and provide good estimation of the demographic histories. Finally, a software package will be developed to incorporate the new methods and assist other researchers to easily apply the method to their own data."
"9295057","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurulation, the developmental process to form the neural tube, represents a critical, yet highly complex step in development of the nervous system. Deficiencies of this morphogenetic process can lead to neural tube defects, one of the most disabling birth defects in humans. One leading cause for neural tube defects is maternal diabetes during pregnancy, with an up to 10-fold higher risk, leading to the prevailing view that maternal diabetes disturbs the process of neural tube closure. However, results from our recent studies prompt us to posit a different hypothesis on the teratogenic mechanism: Maternal diabetes causes birth defects by affecting the process of gastrulation. We suggest that the teratogenicity occurs prior to neurulation, and that maternal diabetes, through the actions of genes such as Nodal, T, Wnt3a, Fgf8, and Tbx6, leads to an aberrant gastrulation process, commencing in the generation of ectopic mesodermal cells. With respect to neural tube defects, we propose that it is the presence of these cells that disrupts the process of neural tube closure. We believe this represents a paradigm shift away from the general concept of fuel-mediated teratogenesis towards a molecular signaling process that not only controls specific cellular properties, but has the potential to explain why neurulation defects usually only affect a small region of the neural tube. Furthermore, a gastrulation-based teratogenic mechanism can explain not only neural tube defects, but also the -seemingly disparate- deficiencies of the heart, and of the caudal region, that comprise the spectrum of defects known as diabetic embryopathy. Specifically, we will combine maternal and in vitro glucose modulation, quantitative assessment of primitive streak explants in culture, and next generation sequencing technology to determine how maternal diabetes and maternal blood glucose can (i) affect the capability of mesodermal cells to migrate and clear the primitive streak; (iii) alter the engagement of gene regulatory networks that are crucial for gastrulation; and (iii) act on migratory properties under conditions f supplementation with folate, which we show can ameliorate neural tube defect incidence in diabetic pregnancies of the Non Obese Diabetic strain of mice that serves as the model system for these studies. We expect that a successful completion of this project will lead to a new perspective on the teratogenicity of maternal diabetes during pregnancy, and to a significant and sustained impact on the field."

"9342883","?Multigenerational epigenetic programming induced by paternal obesity and prediabetes? ABSTRACT Obesity and its related co-morbidities have reached epidemic proportions in the United States and other developed countries, posing an unprecedented challenge to health services. We find that a single generation of paternal obesity and prediabetes programs male offspring with a latent metabolic defect that is exposed by overnutrition. The latent phenotype is transmitted paternally for two generations without further exposure to paternal obesity. Paternal transmission is associated with changes in the sperm small RNAs that are predicted to regulate transcriptional processes. This non-genetic transmission of phenotypes across generations may be a significant contributor to the risk of obesity, and may require intervention and prevention measures across multiple generations. Understanding the scope and the mechanism of this heritable epigenetic programming phenomenon will be critical in developing new strategies to manage or prevent the effects of paternal obesity. This study has the potential to identify biomarkers that could be used to characterize the syndrome in humans. We propose to determine (1) if multiple generations of exposure to paternal obesity and prediabetes amplify the metabolic phenotype in subsequent generations, and/or increase its heritability; (2) the mechanism of paternal inheritance of the metabolic phenotype, through epigenetic changes in the sperm of affected sires; (3) the transcriptional changes that occur in the early embryo in response to epigenetic changes in the sperm. The concept that environmental exposures can induce heritable epigenetic states has received much recent attention, but the subject is very poorly understood and documented. Our experimental system permits a direct test of the epigenetic inheritance model: genetic variants can be ruled out as a factor in transmission because we study isogenic mice, transmission through the paternal line rules out in utero metabolic exposure as a cause, and the high penetrance of the metabolic phenotype makes it amenable to mechanistic studies. The unexpected multigenerational effect of paternal obesity/prediabetes on the metabolism of genetically identical offspring challenges established views on the causes of obesity. This study will provide evidence that there is an inborn but non-genetic component to the risk of obesity, insights into the mechanisms by which that risk is created and transmitted, and a system amenable to further study of the phenomenon."

"9280960","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Visualizing the structures of biological molecular machines is crucial for a mechanistic understanding of cellular function. Cryo-EM is an emergent structural biology technique that is ideally suited to study large macromolecular assemblies, even if they are only available in minute amounts, or if multiple states co-exist in th sample. The cryo-EM field has just entered a new era with the use of high-end electron microscopes coupled to new direct electron detection devices (DDDs) that has led to high resolution structural information, in some cases from only one or a few imaging sessions. As technical barriers open up and the field matures, the impact of new cryo-EM studies will more and more be defined by the output of biological insight. Such will be measured by the relevance of the biological system under study and by whether the experimental strategy is able to provide answers to key functional questions. This scenario requires the synergistic integration of cryo-EM and biochemical expertise in the context of studies that address fundamental biological questions. This program project brings together such set of complementary expertise and provides a mechanism to integrate them seamlessly to tackle biological studies of great medical significance, providing a supportive and coherent environment that promotes interactions among the different projects and advances each of them individually, as well as the cryo-EM field as a whole. This Program Project also provides a mechanism whereby the large costs of operating high-end electron microscopes, associated equipment and computational capabilities are effectively shared among a number of research projects that rely on such state-of-the-art instrumentation. As cryo-EM and image reconstruction are still developing rapidly, optimal use of this methodology requires rigorous retraining and is best facilitated by specialized support personnel and intensive discussion among members of a collaborative group as proposed in this program project.  Our ultimate goal is to maintain and enhance Berkeley's contributions to the structural biology field. We will support and employ a physical and intellectual infrastructure  that allows us to carry out state-of-the-art cryo-EM studies of essential macromolecular complexes and push the capabilities of the cryo-EM technique. This proposal capitalizes on (1) the tradition of innovation and risk-taking within our PPG and years of leadership and expertise in the field of biological electron microscopy and structural biology, (2) the implementation at Berkeley of recent technical breakthroughs in the cryo-EM field (e.g. DDDs, automation, Bayesian methods of image processing), (3) unique biochemical expertise in a large number of biological systems of outstanding biomedical relevance, and (4) the unique local computer resources at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), which is hosted at LBNL."

"9384886","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Mount Sinai BMT CTN Consortium combines three large blood and marrow transplant (BMT) centers (Mount Sinai, Vanderbilt, and the Mayo Clinic; >900 total annual including >250 allogeneic BMT) with a strong track record of productivity within the BMT CTN. Our consortium possesses significant strengths to accomplish BMT CTN strategic goals including long-standing scientific leadership of the BMT CTN, high accrual to BMT CTN clinical trials, a proven ability to enroll large numbers of under-represented minorities in clinical trials, extensive expertise in transplant for non- malignant blood diseases (especially sickle cell disease), and a highly innovative, biomarker-based approach to graft versus host disease (GVHD), the principal complication of allogeneic BMT. Our investigators have developed and validated a novel GVHD-biomarker based score that stratifies patients on the basis of blood samples obtained seven days after BMT that separates patients into low risk and high risk groups for risk of severe GVHD and six month non-relapse mortality (NRM). The day 7 score accurately assigns risk regardless of donor type, degree of HLA-match, conditioning regimen, age, or use of thymoglobulin, making it ideal for testing a preemptive GVHD strategy in the multicenter BMT CTN setting. The majority of deaths in patients with a high risk day 7 score are due to steroid refractory gastrointestinal (GI) GVHD even though symptoms only occur weeks later. We thus propose a preemptive clinical trial to reduce steroid refractory GVHD in high risk patients. We expect such preemption will not increase relapse or deaths from other causes and thereby improve survival. To accomplish this goal, we propose to preemptively treat high risk patients with vedolizumab, a monoclonal antibody that targets ?4?7+ T cells and inhibits their trafficking to the GI tract. Vedolizumab is FDA approved for inflammatory bowel disease and has already successfully been used in a small number of BMT patients with steroid refractory GI GVHD. A desirable attribute of our proposal is that testing this strategy in the patients most likely to develop steroid refractory GVHD will require fewer subjects to detect a beneficial effect. Our specific aims are: (1) To participate vigorously in BMT CTN clinical trials and committees and (2) To preemptively treat biomarker-defined high risk patients with vedolizumab to improve one-year steroid-refractory GVHD-free, relapse-free survival. RELEVANCE: The Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network conducts clinical trials to improve outcomes for patients facing life-threatening diseases. The Mount Sinai BMT CTN Consortium will advance the mission of the BMT CTN by enrolling patients onto BMT CTN clinical trials and providing scientific leadership to the BMT CTN. The proposed clinical trial will mitigate graft-versus-host disease, the most serious BMT complication."
"9335183","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Unwarranted use of antibiotics for pediatric acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) and use of second-line, broad spectrum antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs has contributed to the rapid development of resistance in many strains of bacteria. Provider-parent communication  during pediatric visits for ARTIs strongly influences antibiotic prescribing rates. The overall goal of this study is to develop and test a distance learning quality improvement (QI) program called Dialogue Around respiratory Illness Treatment - DART. The DART program will aim to improve provider communication practices and treatment decisions during pediatric ARTI visits, with the ultimate goal being to decrease rates of antibiotic prescribing for these illnesses in children.  The specific aims of the study are:1) t test the DART program's effectiveness on a) overall antibiotic prescribing rates for all pediatric ARTIs and b) first-line antibiotic prescribing rates for bacterial ARTIs (acute otitis media, Group A Streptococcal pharyngitis, and sinusitis), 2) to test the DART program's effectiveness in changing providers' communication practices during ARTI visits, 3) to determine visit-specific satisfaction levels for parents of children seen by study providers and assess how satisfaction changes as a function of exposure to the DART program, and 4) to assess the cost of implementing the DART program and its impact on health care expenditures.  To accomplish these aims, we propose a quasi-experimental study utilizing a stepped wedge design. In collaboration with two practice-based research networks: the electronic Pediatric Research in Office Settings (ePROS) network and the NorthShore Pediatric network, we will recruit 25 practices to participate. Over an 8 month period, the intervention will be sequentially deployed to five study groups (five practices/group). Each practice will function as part of the control group until they receive the intervention. The DART program's effectiveness will be assessed by examining provider antibiotic prescribing rates for ARTIs (both overall and first-line), communication practices, and parent satisfaction both pre- and post-intervention exposure using survey and electronic health record data. If the DART program is effective for both reducing ARTI antibiotic prescribing to levels consistent with bacterial prevalence rates and increasing use of first-line antibiotics for bacterial ARTIs, we will have an innovative, highly disseminable QI intervention program to further address this critical public health problem."
"9209232","Summary Project 1, Moody The overall goal of the research program is to design immunogens that elicit a broadly neutralizing response Influenza remains a persistent global health threat requiring surveillance of circulating strains. The primary method of preventing influenza infection is vaccination, and in the last two decades, the recommendations for influenza vaccination have been expanded to include almost all people in the US. In a study of recipients of the 2008 trivalent influenza vaccine, we found that the response to influenza vaccination had subtype dominance: most of the responses in any particular individual were directed to a single component of the multivalent vaccine, and included responses to the hemagglutinin (HA) receptor binding site (RBS). We have now found that this dominant response derived from B cells descended from those elicited by the influenza strain circulating when these adults were infants, suggesting that an early influenza exposure may affect the outcome of later responses (imprinting). Investigating these observations has public health implications for the use of various influenza vaccines in infants and adults. Project 1 will test the hypotheses that (i) imprinting of the immune system by early infection with influenza results in subtype dominance in subsequent responses, but that (ii) early vaccination with multivalent vaccine in infants can prime the immune system to produce responses to multiple strains that persist across vaccine seasons and that can remain balanced even after an infection later in life, and (iii) that immunization with HAs designed to stimulate clonal lineages of RBS antibodies can modify an imprinted response. We will investigate these hypotheses in humans and rhesus macaques (RMs)."

"9513208","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Neurodegenerative eye diseases such as glaucoma cause blindness in a large population in the USA, yet effective treatments are lacking. The ultimate goal of this project is to develop new methods for rescue of retinal neurodegeneration by exploiting a unique endogenous neuroprotective agent, the ?1R chaperone, whose anti-apoptotic properties are being uncovered. Our in vivo studies suggest that the ?1R is ROS (reactive oxygen species)-suppressing and is protective against retinal degeneration in ganglion cells as well as in photoreceptors. This project represents the first study to test the efficacy of the ?1R-mediated retinal neuroprotection by ?1R gene therapy, by overexpressing the ?1R in stem cell-derived photoreceptors to enhance their post-transplantation survival, and by using the sigma-1 receptor knock model (?1ko) combined with the chronic DBA/2J glaucoma model or rd10 model.  In Specific Aim 1, we will examine the impact of the absence of the ?1R for the viability of ganglion cells and photoreceptors in vivo in the DBA/2J model of glaucoma and the rd10 model of RP, respectively. Since we have discovered that ganglion cells of the ?1ko mice are more susceptible to retinal degeneration than the wild type in an acute model, we will further test our finding using a new model crossed with the ?1ko and the chronic glaucoma model of DBA/2J. We will also extend our investigation into a neuroprotective role of the ?1R in retinal photoreceptors, which has yet to be defined, in a new model that we have generated by crossing ?1ko and rd10. Retinal ROS levels will be compared in the presence and absence of the ?1R in these models.  In Specific Aim 2, we will test ?1R gene therapy for rescue of retinal degeneration using lentiviruses. To increase the ?1R abundance in the retina, we will transduce the rd10 mouse photoreceptors with lentiviruses harboring the ?1R gene and the Opsin promoter using a technique of subretinal injection. Retinal functions of the transgenic eye overexpressing the ?1R will be compared to that injected with the ?1R-negative mock virus.  In Specific Aim 3, we will explore the neuroprotective effect of the ?1R on the post-transplantation survival of stem cell-derived photoreceptors. In stem cell therapy, elevated oxidative stress due to the death of rods, which are active major consumers of oxygen in the retina, imposes detrimental threat to the survival of transplanted photoreceptors. We will overexpress the ?1R in human embryonic stem cell-derived photoreceptors to enhance their survival after transplantation into the rd10 retina. The pro-survival effect of the ?1R on transplanted photoreceptors will be assessed in comparison to the control transplant cells that are transduced with the ?1R-negative mock virus.  Ultimately, our finding will lead to new ?1R-targeted therapeutic strategies for rescue of the devastating retinal neurodegenerative diseases."
"9395238","PROJECT SUMMARY Eating disorders (EDs) are serious mental illnesses afflicting approximately 5% of women. Anorexia nervosa (AN) is an ED that includes distortions of body shape and size and restriction of calories resulting in insufficient nutrition. Bulimia nervosa (BN) is an ED defined by an over-valuation of a thin body size which leads to dysfunctional eating behaviors, including restriction, binge eating, and purging. Both diseases are defined by altered beliefs about oneself, including problems of self-perception (body image distortions) and self-esteem. Previously, we have found neurobiological differences related to self-perception (medial prefrontal cortex and precuneus) and other-perception (temporoparietal junctions) and social self-evaluations (dorsal anterior cingulate, insula, medial prefrontal cortex) in EDs. Here, we will conduct a detailed analysis of self and other perception in a population of 40 women with AN, 40 women with BN, and 40 healthy women, using a series of complementary functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) tasks in concert with clinical interviews, cognitive assessments, and self-report measures. The key goal of this project is to understand the neurobiological circuitry that mediates the core disturbances related to self-perception in EDs. Four different fMRI tasks have been included that evaluate complementary components of self and other perception. The Self-Tagging task assesses self-perception independent of social evaluations. The Social Identity with Values Task assesses self-perception and perspective-taking in the context of socially-defined values. The Affective Trust Game examines how a specific relationship with another individual develops, by measuring behavioral and neural responses during a series of economic interactions with a specific other person. The Affective Ultimatum game examines how behavior, neural activations, and moods change as subjects play a game that includes shifts of society, created with monetary exchanges. This game will allow a neural, mechanistic examination for a pathological trait believed to be related to pathogenesis of BN: disordered eating behaviors in BN are associated with exposure to different social norms such as the ?thin-ideal? for female shape/size. In addition, three of these tasks consider differences for both positive and negative self-relevant stimuli, allowing us to evaluate how valence might contribute to neurobiological dysfunctions in self and other perception in EDs. We will use dynamic causal modeling (DCM), a method to examine the timing, directionality, and interactions occurring between different neural regions, building a network model of how dysfunctions in self-knowledge contribute to EDs. Core symptoms in adult EDs including feeding symptoms, body preoccupations, self-esteem, anxiety, and depression will be correlated with differences in the self/other neural circuitry. At conclusion of this study, we will have a biomarker understanding of the neurocircuitry for self/other perception and how these differences may contribute to the pathophysiology of EDs."

"9321427","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective is to engineer, build, and clinically validate DBS-Expert, an expert system for optimizing postoperative programming of deep brain stimulation (DBS) in patients with movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The clinical utility of DBS for treatment of PD is well established. However, great outcome disparity exists among recipients due to varied postoperative management, particularly concerning DBS programming optimization. Many programmers have only a cursory understanding of electrophysiology and lack expertise and/or time required to determine an optimal set of DBS parameters from thousands of possible combinations. DBS-Expert will improve outcomes and equalize care across the country for patients not in close proximity to DBS specialty centers. The primary innovations include 1) automated functional mapping based on objective motion sensor-based motor assessments that will intelligently navigate the DBS parameter space to guide the programming session and 2) intelligent algorithms that will find a set of parameters that optimize for efficacy while minimizing side effects and battery usage. The clinically deployable DBS-Expert system will include wireless wearable motion sensors, a tablet software app, and secure cloud storage. The app will include a simple interface to guide the programming session, collect all sensor and stimulation data, and adjust DBS settings. For typical use, the system will start by performing automated monopolar survey to determine the patient-specific functional anatomy around the lead site and narrow the search space for determining an optimal set of programming parameters. This therapeutic window will be valuable at the initial postoperative programming session and simplify subsequent adjustment sessions. In Phase I, subjects with PD wore our existing Kinesia motion sensor while prototype software guided an automated monopolar survey. Stimulation was incrementally increased at each contact until symptoms stopped improving or side effects appeared. Search algorithms were successfully developed to automatically identify optimal DBS stimulation parameters. Parameters chosen by the algorithms improved symptoms by nearly 36% or maintained therapeutic benefits while reducing stimulation amplitude to decrease battery usage. Phase II will include 1) developing an app to integrate the successful Phase I prototype functional mapping software with DBS IPG programmer communication protocols to streamline use, 2) a multi-center clinical evaluation to optimize specific functional mapping protocols and parameter space navigation algorithms, and 3) integration of the optimal search algorithm and bidirectional communication protocols into a commercially viable product. We hypothesize DBS-Expert will improve patient outcomes, access to care, clinician and patient experience, battery usage, and frequency and duration of follow-up programming sessions compared to traditional programming practices."
"9356593","Summary/Abstract  The burden of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) is borne disproportionately by low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where about 75% of global NCD deaths occur, almost half of these prematurely (before age 70). In Uganda, NCDs are responsible for four of the leading ten causes of age-standardized deaths, yet data on the burden of NCD risk factors are limited, obscuring the magnitude of the burden and posing a barrier to defining risks, vulnerable groups, and the impact of potential interventions. These limits are a consequence of scarce research capacity to document and analyze the burden and risk factors and to help design responsive interventions. Through a collaborative research program in Uganda, we propose to create a system for data collection and analysis that will define the burden of NCD risk factors, develop sustainable data systems, and train Ugandans in NCD research. We will apply these results to reduce the growing burden of NCDs across the lifespan and propose a larger intervention study at the end of two years. The Mobile Phone Surveys for NCD Risk Factors in Uganda (MoP-NCD) program will be based on close collaboration between Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health (JHU), USA, and Makerere University School of Public Health (MU) and Iganga-Mayuge Health and Demographic Surveillance Site (IM-HDSS), both in Uganda. We will use US expertise to strengthen the Ugandan institutions, promote a sustainable research enterprise focused on NCDs, and enable further research by proposing an intervention study. After developing a nationally relevant list of data elements key to understanding the epidemiology and burden of NCDs in Uganda, we will create a NCD risk factor survey and develop a mobile phone-based platform suitable for Uganda to run the survey (MoP-NCD) to generate data on NCD risk factors and help to define the epidemiology and outcomes of NCDs in Uganda. We will train IM-HDSS and MU personnel and data collectors to conduct household NCD surveys to collect data on NCD risk factors on all adults at IM-HDSS, run the MoP-NCD survey to collect data on NCD risk factors on all adults at IM-HDSS, then compare MoP-NCD data with household survey data to establish the validity of this novel survey methodology. Joint JHU-MU analysis of all core data will define priorities for future interventions. This project will develop research capacity among Uganda's health professionals to carry out and maintain the use of this tool and analyze the results by offering intensive training at JHU for selected MU colleagues on NCD epidemiology, bioethics, and application of mHealth technologies, as well as short- term training workshops on NCD surveillance and online courses and webinars from JHU on priority topics in measuring NCD risk factors and the health and economic consequences. JHU faculty will help design the training curriculum and mentor MU colleagues; they will contribute to online and on-site teaching in Uganda. We intend this project to culminate in a joint JHU-MU proposal (R01 NIH) to evaluate a set of interventions for NCD risk factors that will promote use of MoP-NCD to evaluate the impact of interventions in Uganda."
"9258326","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Huntington's disease (HD) is a hereditary neurological disorder characterized by chorea, cognitive deficits and psychiatric symptoms. In HD there is a massive loss of striatal medium-sized spiny neurons (MSNs). MSNs can be divided into neurons of the direct and indirect striatal output pathways, based on the output nuclei they project to. MSNs of each pathway can also be separated based on molecular markers such as the expression of dopamine D1 receptors (D1) on direct and adenosine receptors (A2A) on the indirect pathway MSNs. MSNs of the indirect output pathway, which project primarily to the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), are believed to be affected earlier in the progression of HD compared to direct pathway MSNs. Most research in HD focuses on the striatum, but little has been done on examining the alterations that occur in striatal output nuclei of the direct pathway (substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr)) or the indiret pathway, the GPe. I propose to examine how the direct and indirect pathway striatal output nuclei are altered in HD by studying changes that occur in mouse models of HD. I will use optogenetic techniques to regulate the firing of direct or indirect pathway MSNs to determine potential input alterations. Finally I will remove the mutant huntingtin gene from either the direc or indirect pathway MSNs. Then I will use optogenetics to stimulate the pathways and examine what alterations occur in an animal that has normal D1 or A2A MSNs while all other cells contain the mutant huntingtin protein."
"9280967","Project C ? Structural Studies of Microtubule Dynamics and Interactions in Mitosis  Eva Nogales  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   Microtubules (MTs) are cytoskeletal polymers of ??-tubulin that play essential roles in all eukaryotic  cells. MTs form the mitotic spindle, a dynamic suprastructure that separates duplicated chromosomes  equally between daughter cells during cell division. Central to this function is the property of dynamic  instability by which MTs switch between growing and shrinking phases powered by GTP hydrolysis.  Anticancer drugs that bind to tubulin stop cell division by interfering with MT dynamics. On the other hand,  many MT cellular partners modulate dynamic instability or utilize it to carry out specific functions. Among  the first are +TIPs, proteins that track MT growing ends and affect their dynamic behavior. Among the  second are kinetochore complexes ?protein assemblies that connect chromosomes to spindle MTs? that  are able to harness the energy of MT depolymerization to move chromosome during cell division. We are  interested in deciphering the molecular mechanisms by which MTs undergo dynamic instability, how  this property is regulated by cellular factors and antimitoti agents, and how MT dynamics are used by  kinetochore components for chromosome movement. Towards these goals we are using cryo-electron  microscopy (cryo-EM) to provide unique structural insight into physiologically relevant structures of MTs in  different nucleotide and drug states, and visualize the interactions between MTs and a +TIP protein (EB3),  and between MTs and large kinetochore complexes.   For the biochemically simpler studies we aim for atomic resolution detail concerning changes in  tubulin structure that drive MT disassembly or stabilization by EB3 or drugs. Such studies rely on state-  of-the-art cryo-EM equipment and on our novel data processing strategy to take advantage of the pseudo-  helical symmetry of MTs. These studies will provide an unprecedented pool of mechanistic information  concerning MT dynamic instability, its obliteration by important anticancer agents, and one major cellular  strategy for its regulation. Our structures will constitute unique material for computational studies  aiming at modeling physical properties of MTs or at uncovering new potential sites for drug design to  control MT behavior/cell proliferation, and ultimately fight disease. Our ambitious MT-kinetochore  interaction studies also rely on state of the art equipment and will involve an innovative bootstrapping  structural approach where molecular complexity and experimental difficulty are build up one step at a  time, and where the interpretation of each EM structure builds on the previous step in a robust manner.  Our overreaching goal is the structural characterization of a complete kinetochore and its regulated  interaction with MTs.   These studies will shed mechanistic light into mitosis and contribute to the improvement or  development of anticancer agents that interfere with the normal or diseased mitotic process."
"9250822","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Impel NeuroPharma is developing a nose-to-brain drug delivery device to enable drugs to bypass the blood brain barrier (BBB) in humans. This Phase II SBIR aims to develop robust, non-custom, and affordable devices for use in preclinical studies that makes the technology more accessible to researchers everywhere. During this project, Impel will be assisted by Drs. William Frey and Leah Hanson at HealthPartners Neuroscience Research, who are experts in nose-to-brain drug delivery.  Development of neurological and mental health drugs often requires preclinical testing in multiple animal models to demonstrate efficacy and safety and to elucidate mechanisms. Drug delivery to the central nervous system (CNS) to target neurological diseases is particularly problematic because the blood-brain barrier (BBB) prevents most compounds from reaching the brain from blood. While other methods of animal CNS delivery exist, these methods are invasive, not precise, or are not easily translated to clinical use. Overall, the difficulty of distributing drugs to the CNS severel limits drug development efforts.  Impel's novel Precision Olfactory Delivery (POD) device allows non-invasive, targeted delivery of drugs and biologics to the CNS using the nose-to-brain route of the olfactory region to bypass the BBB. The POD device is ideal for preclinical animal studies because it precisely targets the CNS without disrupting the BBB and is scalable across a spectrum of animal models. Impel has promising POD device data in multiple preclinical models and in humans. Commercial interest in this product has been confirmed by large pharmaceutical companies and academic laboratories who have already set up agreements to use the POD device. This Phase II project will greatly decrease POD device prices, make them more accessible, and increase the number of CNS therapeutics investigated via the nascent and promising nose-to-brain pathway. As more therapeutics are investigated, more CNS disease treatments should become available to the public.  In Phase I, feasibility was demonstrated and the primary milestone was achieved, as Impel developed primarily molded versions of POD devices that are not significantly different from hand-made prototypes (e.g., olfactory region dose deposition was less than 10% different than bench-use POD devices). Additionally, testing tools were created for continued development, including preclinical nasal models, a deposition testing stage, and an impact force testing apparatus. Impel has confirmed commercial interest in the proposed Phase II project from academics and industry, including multiple research labs and a large pharmaceutical company.  In this Phase II project, mouse, rat, and primate POD devices will be refined. Impel will develop high- volume molds and a semi-automated assembly process (Aim 1), perform in vitro validation (Aim 1), perform in vivo validation (Aim 2), develop professional training materials (Aim 3), and optimize training materials so target end-users can successfully deposit drugs in vivo (Aim 3). This project will take two years to complete."
"9315885","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Summary/Abstract Hybrid coronary revascularization (HCR) is the intentional combination of minimally invasive surgical grafting of the left anterior descending artery (LAD) coronary artery using the left internal mammary artery (LIMA) with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) of non-LAD coronary stenosis. HCR procedures are being adopted by clinicians nationwide, in an effort to reduce morbidity, mortality, recovery time, repeat re-interventions, and the costs of revascularization for patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) involving the LAD and/or left main coronary arteries. To date, there has been no randomized controlled trial to establish whether HCR achieves these results, and increasing adoption of HCR is proceeding without a solid evidence base. The proposed trial is designed to fill this knowledge gap and provide an evidence base for clinical practice. We propose a pragmatic, large-scale clinical trial that evaluates the effectiveness and safety of HCR compared to multi-vessel PCI. The trial will enroll 2354 patients with multi-vessel CAD involving the LAD distribution and a clinical indication for revascularization, who are eligible for both HCR and multi-vessel PCI with drug eluting stents. The primary outcome will be occurrence of MACCE, defined as all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction, stroke, and repeat revascularization over a minimum of 5 year follow-up after randomization. A vanguard phase will be conducted over the first year of the trial to establish feasibility of enrollment and data completeness of centralized collection of MACCE events. The innovative design of the trial combines collection and adjudication of minimal trial-specific data with national registry data (STS and NCDR), resulting in a streamlined and very cost-effective trial. A previous NIH-funded observational study (RC1 HL100951-01, Principal Investigators, J. Puskas, D. Ascheim), informing the design of this trial, demonstrated that 10-15% of patients with CAD are anatomically eligible for HCR and confirmed that equipoise exists among cardiologists and surgeons to randomize such patients. To conduct this trial, we have assembled a Hybrid Trial Network of 49 selected clinical sites experienced in multi-vessel PCI, minimally invasive LIMA-LAD grafting, and HCR. Co-Investigators from cardiology and cardiac surgery have signed Letters of Collaboration from all sites. In the past two years the Hybrid Network sites have performed >6500 CABG procedures and approximately 15,000 multi-vessel PCI procedures for patients with suitable coronary anatomy, and, therefore, have a large volume of patients eligible for HCR. The results of the Hybrid Trial could fundamentally change management of patients with CAD, the number one cause of death in the United States. This trial, which will support numerous clinical centers across the country and the DCC and CCC, will provide evidence to guide and improve treatment decisions and optimize the utilization of health care resources for this growing patient population."

Electron Microscopy of the Class III Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinase Complex in  Autophagy  James Hurley  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Autophagy is a central pathway for cellular homeostasis and robustness to stress. The synthesis of  phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PI(3)P) by the autophagy-specific class III phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase  complex (PI3KC3) is fundamental and central to the initiation of autophagy. Normal autophagic function  protects agains neurodegenerative diseases. Autophagy is also tumor suppressive, since the protein encoded  by the BECN1 tumor suppressor gene is part of the core autophagy machinery. Declines in autophagic  function are associated with aging and neurodegeneration. The development of allosteric PI3KC3 activators  would appear to have excellent potential as therapeutic stimulators of autophagy. The principal form of PI3KC3  involved in triggering autophagy consists of a 1:1:1:1 complex of the subunits VPS34, VPS15, BECN1, and  ATG14. The structures of many individual ordered fragments of PI3KC3 have been determined, but there are  We have now obtained a 3D reconstruction of PI3KC3 for the first  time using negative stain EM. The complex is dynamic, however, with careful attention to the selection of  appropriate class average and the use of maximum likelihood-based 3D reconstruction, we have been able to  generate a 28 Å map. We have used maltose-binding protein tags to identify all of the subunits, and all of the  known ordered domains have been assigned to regions of the density. We will carry forward the initial negative  stain reconstruction into cryoelectron microscopy to extend the resolution as high as possible, with potential to  reach atomistic resolution. CryoEM will then be used to understand in detail the structural changes that occur  when PI3KC3 is activated by starvation, by phosphorylation by kinases such as ULK1, and by binding to  regulatory proteins such as NRBF2. Insights into the allosteric circuitry of PI3KC3 activation will be invaluable  conceptually for development of autophagy activators. High resolution cryoEM structures may ultimately have  a direct practical application in identifying the binding sites and mechanisms of action of lead compounds. The  work outlined here will, if successful, have a transformative impact on the basic science of autophagy initiation  and that therapeutic targeting of autophagy to fight neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and aging.  no structural data on the larger complex."

"9428227","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Helicobacter pylori is a Gram-negative bacterium that colonizes the gastric mucosa of humans. Although most H. pylori-infected persons remain asymptomatic, potentially serious sequelae of infection include gastric adenocarcinoma, duodenal or gastric ulceration, and gastric lymphoma. Gastric cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and H. pylori has been classified as a type I carcinogen by the World Health Organization. One of the most important virulence factors of H. pylori is a protein known as CagA. CagA is secreted through a type IV secretion system (T4SS) and enters gastric epithelial cells, where it causes a complex set of alterations in cellular signaling that are associated with malignant transformation. CagA and components of the T4SS are encoded by genes within a chromosomal region known as the cag pathogenicity island (PAI), which is present in some H. pylori strains but not others. The incidence of symptomatic gastroduodenal disease (gastric cancer or peptic ulceration) is higher among persons infected with cag PAI-positive strains than among persons infected with cag PAI-negative strains. The effects of CagA on host cells have been studied in great detail, but thus far there has been only limited study of CagA secretion. The T4SS used for CagA secretion exhibits unique and specialized features that differ from those of well-studied T4SSs used for mobilization of DNA. The overarching long-term goals of this research are to develop a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori causes gastric disease, and to determine why gastric disease arises in a small subset of infected persons while most remain asymptomatic or derive health benefits. The aims of the project are i) To define the molecular organization of the membrane-spanning cag T4SS core complex; ii) To determine the three-dimensional structure of the cag T4SS core complex; and (iii) To define consequences of T4SS activity in animal models of H. pylori infection and gastric malignancy. Methods will include robust electron microscopy approaches for analyzing the structure of the T4SS core complex, specialized techniques for genetic manipulation in H. pylori, and newly developed methods for regulating the transcription of genes encoding T4SS components. These studies should provide important advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which H. pylori infection can lead to gastric cancer and other gastric diseases. On a broader scope, these studies will increase our understanding of bacterial secretion systems and the delivery of virulence factors into host cells, as well as molecular mechanisms underlying microbe-induced carcinogenesis."
"9340254","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pervasive underreporting of abortion in our nation's primary fertility-related surveys compromises the study of abortion, pregnancy and fertility. Relatively little is known about the role of induced abortion in American fertility because it remains a highly sensitive behavior, and social surveys to date have not been able to elicit accurate reporting of women's pregnancy experiences. Researchers have long recognized the underreporting of abortion in U.S. household surveys, but no substantial progress in improving the quality of women's abortion reports has been made in nearly twenty years. To obtain accurate measures of U.S. fertility behaviors and to understand the role of abortion in women's lives, we propose to develop new techniques and improve existing methodologies for measuring abortion reporting, with findings relevant to improvements in the measurement of other sensitive behaviors. This project will focus on two related objectives. Aim 1 will investigate levels and correlates of abortion underreporting in three widely-used nationally representative surveys. Using a number of National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) data resources, we will identify individual- and contextual-level correlates of underreporting, exploiting rarely- used geocoded measures of social context. Additionally, we will examine discrepancies in reporting by survey mode for women and men, and the impact of survey-level factors drawn from interviewer and administrative reports. We will compare the patterns of women's underreporting between the NSFG and two other major nationally-representative fertility surveys with varied abortion question wordings and means of administration (National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health [Add Health]). Finally, we will examine the consistency of retrospective reporting of prior abortions at two points in time for both women and men, utilizing the repeated measurement of full pregnancy histories in Add Health. Aim 2 will develop, test and evaluate new approaches to improve abortion reporting in future surveys. We will develop strategies to reduce sensitivity of reporting, building on findings from Aim 1, cognitive interviews and focus groups, and analysis of initial experimental tests currently under development. These findings and guidance from an Expert Panel will be used to design and test 10 randomized experimental arms in a national internet survey. Our initial plans for the experimental arms are to test the effect on abortion reporting of different question wordings and the placement of the questions within the survey. These findings will move the fields of fertility behaviors and survey methodology forward by significantly improving the measurement of abortion and other sensitive behaviors in the United States, thereby opening up wider possibilities for research."
"9383541","Understanding the basic mechanisms of normal and abnormal voice production is centrally important to the treatment of voice disorders. Glottal insufficiency from vocal fold paresis and paralysis is one of the most common voice disorders encountered in clinical medicine. Neuromuscular dysfunction leads to laryngeal left/right asymmetry and abnormalities of the two main independent variables related to glottal vibratory characteristics and acoustic output: (1) vocal fold stiffness and (2) glottal channel pre- phonatory shape (length, vertical height, and contour). A significant knowledge gap exits in our understanding of the cause-effect relationship between these aspects of glottal asymmetry and their acoustic, vibratory, and perceptual consequences. In this proposal we will systematically study laryngeal asymmetry by (1) quantifying the effects of asymmetric laryngeal activation on acoustics, aerodynamics, glottal vibration and vocal quality, (2) investigate glottal channel shape changes and their effects on vibration in paresis/paralysis conditions and in normal phonation, and (3) systematically evaluate the role of vocal fold implant stiffness and medial surface shape in the treatment of vocal insufficiency. These investigations will provide an improved knowledge base on which to build an evidence-based approach to treatment of neurogenic voice disorders."
"9395650","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Nucleus pulposus (NP) cells reside in a soft, gelatinous matrix that dehydrates and becomes increasingly fibrotic with age. Age-related changes in these ?physical cues? of matrix stiffness may be potent regulators of NP cell phenotype, and may contribute to transitions toward a senescent and fibroblastic NP cell with a limited capacity for repair. This project proposed in the NRSA Fellowship will study how ?physical cues? of matrix stiffness can regulate NP cell phenotype and identify mechanisms that can preserve a biosynthetically active, juvenile NP cell phenotype. We have shown that NP cells forming multi-cell clusters on ?soft? laminin-presenting substrates demonstrate biosynthetically active, juvenile NP phenotype with cytosolic localization of myocardin related transcription factor (MRTF-A), a co-activator of serum response factor (SRF) that promotes fibroblast-like behaviors in many cells. Additionally, it has been shown that other nuclear factors and signaling pathways may mediate mechanoresponses to matrix physical properties. In Specific Aim 1, we will determine if MRTF-A co-activation of SRF is necessary for promoting the fibroblastic differentiation of human NP cells, measured as decreased expression of NP-specific markers and reduced ECM biosynthesis, when cultured upon ?stiff? substrates. Primary human NP cells will be transduced with SRE-luc or LifeAct GFP reporter plasmids, and then MRTF-A will be knocked down with CRISPRi/Cas9. Cells will be cultured on ?stiff? PEG-laminin hydrogels and assessed for key NP-specific matrix synthesis and molecular markers, transcription factor and signaling molecule activity, and cytoskeletal organization. RNA-seq analysis will determine any downstream pathways implicated in MRTF-SRF signaling. In Specific Aim 2, we will evaluate if blocking YAP/TAZ activation of TEAD can promote NP-specific marker expression and elevated biosynthesis for adult human NP cells cultured on ?stiff? substrates. Human NP cells will carry either TEAD-luc or LifeAct-GFP reporter plasmids and then transduced with lentivirus carrying YAP CRISPRi/Cas9 plasmid to disrupt YAP/TAZ signaling. These cells will be cultured on ?stiff? laminin-presenting hydrogels (as well as ?soft? for a control) and measured for the same NP-specific markers and RNA-seq analysis as in Specific Aim 1.  The applicant will work with the Sponsor and mentoring team to learn new techniques in state-of-the-art genome engineering and RNA-seq methods as well as methods to quantify cytoskeletal organization that will advance both the applicant's career and the translation of cell phenotype manipulation for application to disc regeneration.

"9358336","Family planning (FP) services for people living HIV/AIDS (PLHA) focus on preventing unplanned pregnancies and mother-to-child-transmission (PMTCT), and currently provide no services to support safer conception, despite ~40% of HIV+ women in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) becoming pregnant post HIV diagnosis. About half of these pregnancies are planned, highlighting the need for safer conception counseling (SCC) as over half of HIV-affected couples in Uganda are serodiscordant, while the unplanned pregnancies reveal a high unmet need for effective contraception. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly reduces the transmission risks associated with childbearing, but many PLHA are either not on ART or not adequately adherent; hence the need for using safer conception methods (SCM) such as manual self-insemination (MSI) and timed unprotected intercourse (TUI). Transforming FP programs through the integration of SCC is not only important for promoting safer conception, but may also be key to reducing unwanted pregnancies, as well as increased PMTCT uptake, adherence and retention, as open consultation about childbearing promotes informed decisions regarding childbearing, access to contraceptives, and can limit clients feeling the need to disengage from HIV care when pregnant due to fear of childbearing-related stigma. Drawing on an ecological adaptation of the Information Motivation and Behavioral skills (eIMB) model, we developed and piloted a structured SCC intervention with 42 serodiscordant couples, 33 (79%) of whom correctly used TUI or MSI as instructed; there were 7 pregnancies and no partner seroconversions. An additional 43 couples were eligible but after the initial SCC consultation, and discussion of the risks and benefits involved, decided not to further pursue childbearing and were referred for contraceptive services. Building on this evidence of preliminary feasibility and acceptance of the intervention, and support for a comprehensive FP approach that uses open childbearing consultations to ensure that clients receive SCC and PMTCT, or contraception services, to achieve their desired reproductive goals, the proposed cluster RCT will compare (1) a comprehensive FP program that incorporates a structured, multi-component SCC intervention (SCC1) versus (2) an SCC training workshop for FP nurses (SCC2; mimics approach used by Ugandan MoH to integrate new services), and (3) existing FP services (usual care) at nine HIV clinics operated by TASO Uganda. The 3-arm design, together with the planned cost-effectiveness analysis, allows us to examine two models for integrating SCC into FP services that differ on level of intensity, thereby informing MoH policy and resource allocation. Sixty clients in serodiscordant relationships who express childbearing desires at recruitment will be enrolled at each site (n=540) and followed for 12 months or completion of pregnancy (if applicable). The primary outcome is use of either SCM (for those trying to conceive) or dual contraception (those who decide against pregnancy)."

"9334917","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a fatal and devastating lung disease of unknown etiology with an  average  life  expectancy  of  3-5  years  from  initial  diagnosis,  40,000  patients  die  each  year  from  IPF.  The  IPF  lung  is  characterized  by  extensive  leading  to  defective  oxygen  exchange  due  to  thickening  of  the  alveolar  membrane. Currently there are no curative drug therapies for IPF.  The IPF lung is characterized by extensive  changes  in  histological  changes  that  include  formation  of  fibroblastic/myofibroblastic  foci,  accumulation  of  extracellular matrix and areas of aberrant remodeling interspersed with normal lung parenchyma. Molecularly,  the  IPF  lung  exhibits  significantly  altered  patterns  of  mRNA  and  microRNA  expression  and  DNA  methylation  and  aberrations  in  coagulation,  apoptosis,  oxidative  stress,  endoplasmic  reticulum  stress  and  activation  of  developmental pathways.    MicroRNAs  are  of  particular  interest  because  they  act  as  negative  regulators  of  gene  expression  by  inhibiting the translation or promoting the degradation of target mRNAs.  Because individual microRNAs often regulate the expression of multiple target genes with related functions, modulating the expression of a single microRNA can, in principle, influence an entire gene network and thereby modify complex disease phenotypes.  The  mir-29  family  is  among  the  key  microRNA  families  implicated  in  liver,  kidney,  heart  and  lung  fibrosis.  Proven  targets  of  the  mir-29  family  include  mutiple  extracellular  matrix  molecules,  including  fibronectin,  collagens 1 and 3 as well as profibroti molecules such as IGF1 and CTGF. With specific relevance to IPF, expression of members of the mir-29 family is decreased in the human IPF lung as well as in animal models of lung fibrosis and expression of mir-29 targets is increased. Introduction of mir-29 to the lung blunts the fibrotic response in animal models of disease. More recently, a miR-29 mimic (developed by miRagen) that exhibits  preferential  lung  distribution  when  administered  systemically,  was  shown  to  blunt  bleomycin-induced  pulmonary fibrosis in mouse.      The overall objective of this proposal is to facilitate the development of mir-29 mimicry as a novel long- term, efficient and personalized anti-fibrotic therapy building on the complementary expertise of Yale School of Medicine, miRagen Therapeutics and the Lovelace Institute.  We will achieve this objective by performing the  steps  required  for  a  successful  IND  application,  including  the  determination  of  best  route  of  delivery,  absorption, metabolism, distribution, of the mir-29 mimic, performance toxicology and bioavailability studies in  larger  animals,  Scaling  up  production  and  manufacturing  and  development  and  validation  of  biomarkers  for  need and efficacy.

"9385023","Project Summary The promise of marrow transplantation has been diminished by the development of relapse, opportunistic infection and GVHD. These three complications interlock in a Gordian knot that precludes independent resolution strategies. Immunologic approaches to relapse result in more GVHD. Conventional pharmacologic approaches to treat GVHD with increasing immunosuppression result in more opportunistic infection. This is particularly a concern in non-malignant disease where relapse is less concerning. Our group has adopted an alternative strategy to treat GVHD, by emphasizing approaches that enhance immunoregulatory networks, rather than brute force immunosuppression. Our laboratory research has identified several exploitable targets to control GVHD without global immunosuppression. In this project we focus on chronic GVHD. First, we specifically expand on our prior work demonstrating that regulatory T cells (Treg) can be selectively expanded in patients with cGVHD using very low doses of interleukin-2 (IL-2). We demonstrated previously that Treg are depressed in patients with cGVHD. While infusion of Treg may transiently increase Treg numbers, infusions are by their nature expensive, time consuming, and logistically complex. Alternatively, Treg can be expanded in vivo with daily subcutaneous injections that maintain Treg levels at 9-fold above baseline, reverse the ratio of Treg to conventional CD4+ T cells (Tcon), and ameliorate the manifestations of steroid resistant cGVHD in a clinically relevant and significant fashion. Moreover, this approach also allows a substantial reduction in immunosuppressive medications. We hypothesize that expanding Treg at the outset of cGVHD therapy will allow more effective control of cGVHD manifestations with lower cumulative steroid utilization. Second, we have demonstrated the critical role of humoral immunity in cGVHD. Basic studies in mice and in humans indicate that germinal center formation, the development of autologous and allogeneic antibodies, and B cell cytokines are all important in the generation of cGVHD. Moreover we and others have demonstrated the benefit of anti-B cell approaches in the therapy (rituximab, ibrutinib) and prophylaxis (rituximab) of cGVHD. We propose a 3-armed randomized trial comparing the use of the combination of prednisone alone with prednisone and low dose IL-2, to prednisone, IL-2, and rituximab as primary therapy for cGVHD. The intermediate goal is to compare the ability of each therapy effectively treat cGVHD. The long-term goal is to allow us to pick-the-winner for a phase 3 trial and develop an effective, non-toxic, and physiologically relevant therapy for cGVHD.  "
"9277659","MANAGEMENT, DISSEMINATION AND TRAINING - PROJECT SUMMARY The management, dissemination and training planned for the next four years of GENCODE will largely continue the practices found to be successful in the current project. The major difference for this proposal is the transition of the project to EMBL-EBI. The date of final transition for the WTSI HAVANA team is set for 1 April 2017, coincident with the start of the proposed funding from this application, and will follow an orderly process informed by previous resource transitions from WTSI to EMBL-EBI. As the technical transition proceeds, we will move computational and software infrastructure from WTSI to EMBL-EBI through 2016 and early 2017, and provide HAVANA staff with guest logins to for testing before transition. The staff and physical transition will occur in 2017. All HAVANA staff moving to EMBL-EBI will be offered EMBL contracts with a start date of 1 April 2017. In terms of project management, the Scientific Advisory Board (SAB) will continue to provide advice on all aspects of the project, including progress, priorities, new technologies, operational processes of the consortium, and will also serve as representatives of the user community. The SAB will meet annually. A Research Support Officer will be deployed at 0.5 FTE on the project to organize the annual SAB meetings, and also to ensure regular meetings and teleconferences between the partners, as well as regular updates and reports. In terms of access, the major aims for GENCODE are regular releases of annotation; maintenance and extension of the existing GENCODE portal website (http://www.gencodegenes.org) providing information to the research and clinical community working on human and mouse genetics and genomics; and the design and implementation of new web interfaces. Annotation will be released through the Ensembl and UCSC browsers, as well as via FTP and HTTP, and Track Hubs. The GENCODE portal, used for dedicated data download and specific project news, will be expanded to provide in-depth documentation and details of the processes used within the GENCODE consortium. To further aid data access and discovery via the Ensembl website, new views of visually highlighting the differences and similarities in annotation for different strains of mice will be developed. The training plans for the next phase of GENCODE include extensive workshops, on the use of GENCODE annotation, how to use GENCODE tools, and how to submit annotation to the public genomic archives. Support for users will also be provided remotely by an email Helpdesk, where queries will be tracked by Request Tracker."
"9385524","PROJECT SUMMARY This grant application seeks to renew our status as a Core Clinical Center and member of the Steering Committee of the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN). The City of Hope Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation Program has focused its efforts over the last 40 years on the development of laboratory-based translational research and Phase I, II and III clinical trials leading to improvements in hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) for the treatment of malignant and non-malignant hematologic disorders. During our 15 years as a member of the BMT CTN, we have participated in the development of clinical trials focused on important questions confronting HCT patients, several of which were derived from early phase studies conducted in our program. Many of our faculty members significantly contributed to the successful conduct of the BMT CTN trials and will continue to collectively work toward the common goal of improving outcomes of HCT. As the largest and oldest HCT center in California we offer unique and highly qualified capabilities for accruing diverse patients and supporting multi-center HCT trials, including cellular therapeutics. City of Hope has a longstanding research focus on cytomegalovirus (CMV), the most significant infectious complication post-HCT, addressing the unmet need to improve the current shortfalls of anti-viral drug-based approaches. Our laboratory collaborators have developed and manufactured a CMV vaccine (CMVPepVax) utilizing the HLA A*0201 pp65495-503 CD8+ T cell epitope fused to a universal TH epitope (a natural Tetanus sequence) that is co-injected with the CpG adjuvant PF-03512676. This vaccine has demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in a phase Ib trial of healthy volunteers and in HCT recipients, with promising efficacy signals in reducing CMV reactivation. The placebo-controlled randomized phase II trial of CMVPepVax is currently underway and accruing well. As part of this application we propose that the BMT CTN, in collaboration with City of Hope and the license holder Helocyte, conducts a prospective Phase III randomized, double-blind, multi- center trial of CMVPepVax versus placebo in patients receiving HCT from matched related or unrelated donors. Our study hypothesis is that use of CMVPepVax on days 28 and 56 post-HCT will improve the 12-month CMV- free survival in the vaccine arm compared to the placebo arm."
"9316601","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are associated with several syndromes and diagnoses in women, including urinary incontinence, overactive bladder, voiding dysfunction, urinary tract infections, and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome. These syndromes/diagnoses are common, costly, and lead to significant decreases in quality of life. Despite their common occurrence, however, many of these LUTS are readily preventable and treatable through behavioral or medical/surgical therapy. Several risk factors have been identified for LUTS (e.g., pregnancy and childbirth, later-life overweight/obesity) and several behavioral therapies have been developed to prevent these LUTS in high-risk women (e.g., pelvic floor muscle training in pregnant women) and to reverse or reduce LUTS (e.g., weight loss), offering the promise of both primary and secondary LUTS prevention. However, before we can achieve LUTS prevention, we must address several critical knowledge gaps. These include identification of risk factors for early-onset LUTS to allow prevention opportunities earlier in life; confirmation of additional under-studied risk factors to expand opportunities for prevention; synthesis of the existing literature to highlight research gaps and to help prioritize future research efforts; establishment of healthy bladder behaviors and normal voiding function as a basis for future interven- tions; and a better understanding of patient, provider, and structural barriers (e.g., unclean restrooms) to LUTS prevention to increase the reach and effectiveness of prevention strategies. To address each of these research gaps, we have assembled a portfolio of innovative, collaborative, and multi-site studies (in design or potential) drawing upon the diverse expertise of our multidisciplinary team. Together, our aims address a wide range of risk factors, the full spectrum of LUTS, each of the four lifestages of interest, and each of the objectives for this FOA. Specifically, we propose to: 1) identify risk factors for LUTS (overweight/obesity, habitual amateur high impact physical activity, habitual intake of caffeinated, carbonated, and artificially-sweetened beverages, and traumatic events and abuse) in adolescent girls and young, reproductive age women in the large, unique Growing Up Today Studies 1 and 2; 2) synthesize the existing epidemiologic literature on LUTS risk factors, both qualitatively and quantitatively, and then use this information to highlight remaining research gaps, and identify the most important populations and risk factors to target for prevention; 3) establish the evidence base for normal voiding behaviors and function, document the voiding environment, and examine the influence of acute, modifiable (bowel function, voiding behaviors) and structural factors (voiding environment) on voiding characteristics/acute LUTS; and 4) identify patient, provider, and structural barriers to LUTS prevention across the lifespan through focus groups of patients and providers, and through surveys. Together, our aims will establish the necessary evidence base to initiate future interventional studies of primary and secondary LUTS prevention in adolescents and women, which is the ultimate goal of the Trans-Prevention of LUTS Consortium."
"9323440","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is for the Continuation of the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Clinical Research Network (NASH CRN) - IU Clinical Center. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one out of every three adults and five children in North America and is a growing public health issue in the United States. NAFLD, and especially nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), may lead to end-stage liver disease and primary liver cancer, as well as liver-, cardiovascular-, and cancer- related mortality, resulting in major increases in health burdens and costs. The NASH CRN is ideally and uniquely positioned to impact the growing public health significance of NASH that can only be addressed via a large research consortium. The primary objective of the NASH CRN is to perform clinical research on NASH and NAFLD in adults and children. A closely linked and high priority secondary objective is to conduct translational research in NASH and NAFLD focusing on the pathogenesis that will provide the basis for understanding the natural history and developing means of better diagnosis, treatment, and clinical management. In the next phase of the NASH CRN, the adult and pediatric therapeutic trials initiated during the previous funding cycle will be completed, and new therapeutic trials, including phase 2a proof of mechanism and phase 2b clinical trials will be initiated, to develop evidence-based treatment options that are safe, effective, simple, and inexpensive. The longitudinal cohort of adults and children with NAFLD will be extended, which will prospectively define the natural history of the disease, the cardiovascular and metabolic risk factors, and will aid in biomarker discovery and validation, and development and validation of non-invasive techniques to evaluate and identify those with NASH/NAFLD, who will respond, and how quickly the disease is progressing. IU Clinical Center will actively participate in the (a) successful completion of the ongoing studies, (b) successful launching of new therapeutic trials and (c) development of new ancillary and publication proposals. In addition, IU Clinical Center investigators will actively participate in various committees including the Steering Committee, Ancillary Studies Committee, Genetics Subcommittee, Pediatrics Committee, Pathology Committee and Imaging Committee. IU Clinical Center is eager to continue its collaboration with other clinical centers, data coordinating center, NIDDK program staff, and private sector partners to complete these very important research objectives. The NASH CRN is poised to continue its major impact on the field and directly advance the mission of the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of the public."

"9313002","PROJECT SUMMARY (HOST-MICROBIAL ANALYTICS & REPOSITORY CORE) There is growing evidence for the importance of environmental factors, such as the microbiome, playing a critical role in the pathogenesis of many digestive, liver and pancreatic diseases. There is much interest in the characterization of the microbiome to identify potential biomarkers relevant for precision medicine as well as the modification of the human microbiome as a modality to prevent and/or treat diseases. To facilitate research focused on host-microbial interactions and their relevance to digestive, liver and pancreatic diseases, the Center for Molecular Studies in Digestive and Liver Diseases (CMSDLD) has developed a Host-Microbial Analytic and Repository Core (H-MARC) with the following two Specific Aims: 1) To provide critical analytic services the characterize analytes (i.e. genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics) in both microbes and their mammalian hosts and 2) To provide expertise that will allow CMSDLD members to extend pre-clinical in vitro and animal model research into the human clinical domain. In Specific Aim 1, to support the analysis of the mammalian host, H-MARC will provide access to high-end instruments designed to quantify gene expression at the mRNA and protein levels as well as access to FACS for the characterization of mammalian cell populations. Genomic analysis will be provided via Penn's Next Gen Sequencing Core. To support the analysis of the microbiota, H-MARC will support experiments involving microbial cultures as well as the analysis of metabolites via targeted metabolomics. Computational and biostatistical support to analyze microbiome datasets associated with clinical metadata will also be provided through full time biostatisticians in H-MARC who will interface with the PennCHOP Microbiome Program. In Specific Aim 2, H-MARC will support human subject research by providing a robust Human Biospecimen Repository via a LabVantage-based LIMS system as well as the collection of robust annotated clinical data for IBD phenotyping via the EPIC EMR. Importantly, to facilitate human subject research translating preclinical research into the clinical domain, H-MARC will provide advice and expertise in the development of human intervention studies. Ultimately, H-MARC services are designed to facilitate integrated analyses of host-microbial interactions at the preclinical and clinical interface."
"9359401","Project Summary  The Tobacco and Environmental Carcinogenesis Program, which received ?Outstanding? merit in its first  CCSG submission in 2010, assembles researchers committed to elucidating how exposures to tobacco and  environmental carcinogens cause cancer and how these exposures can be mitigated by risk reduction,  intervention, and communication strategies. Exposure to carcinogens represents a major cause of human  cancers yet individuals who have the same exposures do not all get cancer in the end-organ. This suggests  that significant inter-individual differences exist in cancer susceptibility. Understanding the basis of these  differences can lead to precision risk reduction, which represents the translational impact of the Program. The  foci of the Program is tobacco related cancers (e.g., lung) and asbestos exposure and mesothelioma, with a  developing effort in UV/light exposure and melanoma. Each area provides rich opportunities for inter-  Programmatic research. The Program owes its translational and transdisciplinary vision to Co-Leaders Drs.  Robert Schnoll, a leader in tobacco control, and Trevor Penning, an expert in environmental carcinogenesis.  The scientific aims of the Program are to: 1) Elucidate the pathways underlying exposure risk (e.g., risk factors  for tobacco dependence; environmental exposures and risk for mesothelioma and melanoma); 2) Identify the  mechanisms linking exposure to disease (e.g., steps in multi-stage carcinogenesis); 3) Evaluate methods for  exposure and risk reduction (e.g., tobacco cessation treatments; asbestos remediation; UV light protection);  and 4) Test methods of risk communication (e.g., tobacco marketing, regulatory science). Program members  collaborate extensively, particularly with the Cancer Control and Cancer Therapeutics Programs, on studies of  tobacco use, health communication, and smoking cessation, with the Cancer Therapeutics and Immunobiology  Programs on investigations in thoracic oncology and immunotherapies, and with the Melanoma and Cutaneous  Malignancies Program on UV/light issues. Seminal contributions during the project period include validating the  first genetically-informed biomarker for personalized smoking cessation treatment and identifying novel  mechanisms by which multi-organ carcinogens (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) in tobacco smoke and  the environment are metabolically activated. The intra- and inter-Programmatic environment is facilitated by  active mentoring, symposia, working groups, and pilot grants. The 15 members, who are from five departments  and two schools, have $5.9M in external funding (annual direct costs); $5.8M is peer-reviewed and $2.6M is  NCI-funded. Collaborative grants include an NCI P50 Tobacco Center of Regulatory Science (with Cancer  Control), a P30 Center of Excellence in Environmental Toxicology (CEET; with Cancer Control), a  Pharmacogenomics Research Network U01 (with Cancer Control), and an NIH P42 Superfund Research  Program on asbestos. Members authored 263 cancer-related publications (21% intra-Programmatic; 30%  inter-Programmatic; 46% multi-institutional) during the project period."
"9384516","Fragile X syndrome is the most common heritable form of intellectual disabilities and a leading genetic cause of autism. An effective treatment for the cognitive and social interaction deficits associated with FXS is an unmet need. The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway is a central regulator of cell metabolism, growth, proliferation, survival, cap-dependent translation and the actin cytoskeleton. Whereas dysregulation of mTOR Complex 1 (mTORC1) in Fragile X is well established, a role for mTORC2 is, as yet, unclear. mTORC2 is a central regulator of actin polymerization and spine structure and acts on the actin-depolymerizing factor cofilin implicated in synaptic plasticity and memory. Our finding that cofilin and its upstream regulator Rac1, a small Rho GTPase and direct target of mTORC2 implicated in actin remodeling and spine structure, are impaired in a mouse model of Fragile X provides a functional link between FMRP, mTOR, and cofilin signaling and underscore the clinical relevance of this work. The overall goals of the proposed research are to examine whether overactivated mTORC2 signaling is causally linked to cofilin signaling, spine structure, and synaptic maturation in Fmr1 KO mice, and establish mTORC2 as a novel therapeutic target for the amelioration of FXS. The underlying hypothesis is that loss of FMRP leads to overactivated mTORC2 and cofilin signaling, which induce spine abnormalities, impaired synaptic maturation, sensory processing and autism-relevant behaviors. We seek to test this hypothesis in the following Aims: 1. Examine a causal relation between dysregulation of cofilin signaling and the synaptic phenotype in the somatosensory cortex of young Fragile X mice. Experiments will examine 1) ability of a constitutively active cofilin mutant (S3A) delivered directly into the somatosensory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice via the lentivirus expression system to rescue spine defects; 2) ability of cofilinS3A to rescue delayed synaptic maturation of layer V neurons in the somatosensory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice during the critical period; 3) ability of cofilinS3A to rescue impaired spike- timing LTP at excitatory synapses in the somatosensory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice: 4) ability of a phospho-cofilin peptide, which inhibits endogenous cofilin, to phenocopy aberrant actin polymerization, spine defects and impaired synaptic maturation in somatosensory cortex of WT mice. 2. Identify signaling pathways upstream of aberrant cofilin signaling and ability of pharmacologic and genetic manipulation of mTORC2 signaling to rescue the FXS phenotype. Experiments will establish 1) mTORC2 as an upstream effector critical to aberrant cofilin signaling; 2) Rac1/PAK signaling as a potential pathway upstream of cofilin and downstream of mTORC2 and ability of PAK inhibition to rescue impaired spine structure, synaptic maturation and spike timing LTP; 3) deficits in sensory perception in FXS mice and ability of PAK inhibition to rescue impaired perception; 4) ability of shRNA to Rictor delivered into the somatosensory cortex of Fmr1 KO mice via the lentivirus expression system to correct neurologic defects. These experiments will document the ability of therapeutic strategies targeting mTORC2, Rac1/PAK and cofilin signaling to rescue spine defects, impaired synaptic maturation and autism-relevant behaviors in young Fmr1 null mice."
"9493796","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The urgent need to develop low-cost and high-quality revolutionary technologies for sequencing mammalian-sized genomes has inspired many experimental strategies. Chief among these is the nanopore-based electrophoresis. While excellent progress is continuously being made with this technique, there are many challenges in reaching the goals of very high quality sequencing and fabricating massively parallel sequencing devices. These challenges stem from the physics of nanopore-based electrophoresis of DNA which needs to be understood from a fundamental scientific point of view. The proposed research deals with fundamental understanding of the behavior of DNA in nanopore environments under the influence of electric and hydrodynamic forces, and ratcheting forces from enzymes. We will investigate the challenges underlying several key system components in the goal of reducing the cost, increasing the speed, and increasing the accuracy of sequencing mammalian-sized genomes. The major challenges deal with slowing down DNA through nanopore, effects of specific ions, conformational fluctuations of DNA, effects of flow fields arising from hydrodynamics, salt concentration gradients, and electroosmotic flow, and fluctuations in the processivity of enzymes. We will use a combination of concepts from polymer physics, statistical mechanics theory, computer simulations, and numerical computation of coupled nonlinear equations to address polyelectrolyte statistics and dynamics, electrostatics, and hydrodynamics in the phenomena of DNA translocation. The proposed research, while being generally relevant to all nanopore-based experiments, will be hinged specifically on: (a) slowing down DNA and fundamental understanding of translocation, mediated by voltage, temperature, identity and amount of electrolyte, salt concentration gradient, and patterns on pore surface, (b) controlling the stochasticity in enzyme-ratcheted translocation and fundamental understanding of coupling among fluctuations in enzyme processivity, DNA conformational fluctuations, and electrophoretic drift-diffusion, and (c) designing optimum configuration of compact arrays of thousands of nanopores for massively parallel DNA sequencing without crosstalk between the units."
"9324984","Project Summary / Abstract Core E - Microvascular Complications Core The microvascular complications of type 1 and 2 diabetes are major causes of morbidity and mortality. Adequate murine models of these complications are critical to their understanding, treatment and prevention. Development and testing of murine models of diabetic microvasular complications has been slowed by the relative paucity of uniform phenotyping standards and methods. The Complications Core will help to overcome this barrier by providing validated, reproducible and standardized phenotyping of the 3 major microvascular complications: diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN), nephropathy (DN) and retinopathy (DR). The Microvascular Complications Core will make the phenotyping of mouse models of diabetic complications available, expeditious, affordable, effective, and convenient for individual investigators. In addition to providing education, consultation and advice regarding the analysis of mouse models of complications, the Core will provide phenotyping services using the specialized equipment that it operates. Specifically, the Core will provide assessment of murine DPN, DN and DR using clinical and anatomical assays for each complication and will also offer advanced phenotyping of models exhibiting each complication. DPN advanced testing will include phenotyping of models exhibiting neuropathy such as measures of cell death and oxidative stress in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) and peripheral nerve. DN advanced phenotyping will include measures of podocyte number, precise morphometric analysis of glomerular expansion, glomerular volume and tubulointerstitial fibrosis, EM morphometry of podocyte foot processes, immunohistochemical analysis of podocyte specific proteins, and glomerular isolation. DR advanced testing will include measures of retinal vascular permeability, retinal cell death and non-lethal measures of retinal morphology using optical coherence tomography and visual function using optokinetic response. A significant strength of the Complications Core is that all testing methods will be housed within one laboratory and that all three complications can be assessed in a single mouse. This will allow for the efficient flow and coordination of animal testing, data collection and ultimately tissue harvest. Many assays performed in conscious animals may be repeated over the course of the experiment while others will be performed immediately prior to euthanasia. All components of the Complications Core will work closely together and with client investigators to coordinate the phenotypic characterization of microvascular complications. This comprehensive approach will reveal commonalties and differences among complications as well as addressing the impact of specific gene alterations and treatment regimens."
"9220741","Project Summary The Clinical Cell and Vaccine Production Facility is a Shared Resource of the Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) that is jointly managed with the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Bruce Levine, PhD, Barbara and Edward Netter Professor in Cancer Gene Therapy, has overseen the Facility since its inception, initially as a pilot Facility and then a developing Facility in 1999. The mission of the Facility is to facilitate translation of bench-to-bedside research in novel allogeneic and autologous cell-based vaccines and experimental gene therapies. The Facility performs cell and biologic processing and expansion on a range of different cell types, including peripheral blood and umbilical cord blood derived CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, monocyte derived dendritic cells, and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in support of first-in-human and early Phase I and II cell and gene therapy clinical trials, with an emphasis on cancer. The Facility provides a range of services to ACC investigators to support preclinical process development and validation experiments for successful Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) clinical translation, clinical trial manufacturing, and specified testing for cell and gene therapy products for human administration. Notable accomplishments facilitated by the Facility have been first-in-human trials, including the first use of a lentiviral vector, the first infusions of zinc finger nuclease genome-modified cells, and the first use of lentivirally-modified cells to treat cancer. In 2005, with a considerable investment of non-Core Grant Funds from the University of Pennsylvania Health System, the Abramson Cancer Center and the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine, this facility expanded into a newly renovated 10-room GMP suite within the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). In 2013, demonstrating continued and significantly increasing investigator usage of the Facility the Facility opened a second 10-room GMP suite in HUP (with additional investment of non-Core funds), effectively doubling capacity. These facilities are the only spaces on campus that can perform cell and tissue processing in compliance with FDA regulations 21 CFR Parts 210 and 211. Since 1999, Dr. Levine and the Facility have supported >30 FDA Investigational New Drug Applications at Penn and external institutions and produced over 2000 cellular vaccines that have been safely administered to more than 700 patients. The Facility currently supports manufacturing for 18 investigational new drug applications (INDs). The quality and the quantity of projects and clinical products generated in the Facility are recognized among collaborating institutions and pharmaceutical partners. In the reporting period (10/01/13-09/30/14), 19 investigators used the Facility, of which ACC member usage represents 58%. CCSG support represents 2% of the proposed Facility budget with the remaining funding coming from charge backs and other grants/contracts."

"9511532","?    DESCRIPTION:  Changes in the healthcare delivery system have been brought about nationally by the Affordable Care Act and the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act and locally by a number of Washington State initiatives. As part of these changes substance use disorder (SUD) treatment is being expanded beyond specialty care and integrated into primary care and acute care medical settings where SUD prevalence rates are high. These initiatives have led to an increased focus on SUD screening, brief intervention, and referral to treatment (SBIRT) in these settings. These integrative initiatives are based on collaborative care and chronic disease management approaches. There is an increased need for future research to develop and test the effectiveness of SUD interventions implemented in healthcare settings and linked to specialty SUD treatment programs. This viewpoint also reflects the future direction of the NIDA National Drug Abuse Treatment Clinical Trials Network (CTN) as it expands its research focus beyond community-based specialty treatment programs (CTPs). In order to contribute to the CTN's expanded objectives and research priorities, the Pacific Northwest (PNW) Node proposes the following Specific Aims: (1) Increase the capacity of the PNW Node research team by adding investigators with demonstrated practical and research expertise in developing and coordinating primary care practice-based research networks and collaborative care models, integrating behavioral health and SUD treatment components into primary and acute care settings, and harmonizing and using electronic medical record systems across multiple health care systems; (2) Expand the scope, population, diversity, and focus of research and clinical practice settings affiliated with the PNW Node by adding to our current CTPs a number of large state-wide and regional practice-based primary care clinical and research networks and programs involved in integrated behavioral health collaborative care; (3) Design and conduct pragmatic, comparative effectiveness, registry, and other types of innovative studies, informed bidirectionally by SUD researchers and clinicians and primary and acute care providers, that evaluate SBIRT, integrated behavioral and pharmacological treatments, and components of collaborative care for tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and misused prescription opioid medications and (4) Through the CTN National Dissemination Library, the Northwest and the Central Rockies Addiction Technology Transfer Centers, and resources within the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Institute provide training to health care and SUD providers about SUDs, collaborative care and chronic disease management models, the integration process, and methods of effective linkage between primary care and specialty SUD CTPs. Such training also provides opportunities for dissemination research."
"9298707","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The incidence of IPF and other pulmonary disorders increases with age independent of exposure to common environmental risk factors. Little is known about how age increases the risk for lung diseases. The lack of understanding the relationship between aging and the inability of the lung to repair after injury, as occurs in IPF, leads to an urgent need for more research in the field.  Our own work has demonstrated an increase of susceptibility to chronic lung injury in aged mice. Additionally, we have described that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (B-MSCs) obtained from old mice are deficient in their multi-linage potential and in their capacity to respond to soluble factors. However, what are the biological consequences of an aged endogenous B-MSCs and why they exhibit a functional impairment is not well known. Our published and preliminary data supports the overarching and unique hypothesis that defective lung repair in aging is associated with dysfunctional activation, proliferation, and mobilization of B-MSCs. In the present revised project, we will focus on the effect of age on B-MSCs biology by comparing B-MSCs isolated from young and old donors and in the characteristics of B-MSCs during chronic Injury, by comparing B-MSCs isolated from IPF patients and age-matched and young controls. We are confident this will help us to understand the pathogenesis of other age-associated lung diseases and provide insights for the development of novel strategies for tissue repair."
"9319040","Na-H exchanger NHE3 is responsible directly and indirectly for the majority of NaHCO3 and NaCl reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Phosphorylation sites mediating NHE3 inhibition in response to PKA (S552 and S605), and stimulation in response to SGK1 (S661) and CK2 (S716) have been described. We have recently identified an additional novel phosphorylation site (S791) that stimulates NHE3 activity. The general goal of this project is to elucidate how combinatorial patterns of NHE3 phosphorylation integrate to alter NHE3 trafficking and activity. To accomplish this goal, we will pursue the following specific aims: Aim 1. Generate and confirm specificity of new phosphospecific polyclonal and monoclonal anti-NHE3 antibodies raised against S661, S716, and S791 containing phosphopeptides. Together with our previously generated antibodies to the two PKA sites, these new antibodies will provide us with a unique set of reagents to understand the integrated regulation of NHE3 by phosphorylation in response to physiologic stimuli that regulate proximal tubule transport. Aim 2. Use this panel of phosphospecific antibodies to evaluate the combinatorial patterns of phosphorylation of endogenous NHE3 at multiple residues in native rat kidney in vivo at baseline, and in response to stimuli that either inhibit (e.g. dopamine, PTH) or enhance (e.g. dexamethasone, angiotensin II) NHE3 activity. Compare subcellular localization of phosphorylated NHE3 and total NHE3 in response to these stimuli by immunoblotting of subcellular membrane fractions and by immunofluorescence microscopy. The data from these studies will allow us to generate mechanistic hypotheses concerning the roles of phosphorylation at specific sites or combinations of sites in governing activity and trafficking of NHE3 in vivo. Aim 3. Use OKP proximal tubule cells as a model system to refine and test the hypotheses generated in the preceding aim concerning the roles of phosphorylation at specific sites or combinations of sites in regulating NHE3. Verify changes in patterns of phosphorylation of endogenous NHE3 in OKP cells in response to those stimuli found to alter phosphorylation of NHE3 in vivo. Evaluate temporal sequence of phosphorylation at different sites in NHE3. Compare patterns of phosphorylation of surface and intracellular NHE3 by use of biotinylation studies. Correlate the kinetics of phosphorylation changes with changes in transporter surface expression and activity. Perform mutagenesis studies using transfected NHE3 to test the roles of phosphorylation at specific sites or combinations of sites in governing NHE3 intrinsic activity and trafficking. Aim 4. Identify downstream effector proteins that associate with NHE3 phosphorylated at specific sites or combinations of sites and that mediate changes in NHE3 intrinsic activity and trafficking. Perform co-precipitation studies with antibodies against known NHE3- associated proteins (e.g. megalin, NHERF1, ezrin, PP2A) to determine possible selectivity for NHE3 phosphorylated at specific combinations of residues. Use affinity chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify novel proteins that associate with NHE3 phosphorylated at specific sites or combinations of sites."
"9328345","PROJECT SUMMARY  Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disorder that is characterized by pathogenic autoantibody production and is associated with prevalent hypertension, renal injury, and cardiovascular disease. Our laboratory has shown that female NZBWF1 mice, an established mouse model of SLE, develop hypertension and exhibit impaired renal hemodynamic function, including increased renal vascular resistance and impaired renal sodium excretion. Recent studies by our laboratory have shown that chronic B cell depletion with anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody reduces autoantibody production and prevents the development of hypertension; however, the treatment was only effective when administered before the onset of autoantibody production. Additional preliminary data indicates that treatment with the immunosuppressive drug mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) resulted in B cell depletion, lowered anti-dsDNA autoantibody production, and attenuation of hypertension. While these data support the concept that autoreactive B cells and the associated autoantibodies contribute to SLE hypertension, it is important to recognize that the majority of serum immunoglobulin is secreted by long-lived plasma cells that are differentiated from B cells and not affected by either MMF or anti-CD20 therapies. Initial studies with the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib reveal that this drug depletes plasma cells and lowers autoantibody production in NZBWF1 mice. Based on these preliminary data, my central hypothesis is that pathogenic autoantibodies produced by plasma cells during SLE impair renal hemodynamic function, causing a shift in the pressure natriuresis relationship, resulting in the development of hypertension. Aim 1 of the proposal will test the hypothesis that production of autoantibodies by plasma cells promotes the development of hypertension during SLE and aim 2 will test the hypothesis that autoantibodies impair renal hemodynamic function causing a hypertensive shift in the pressure natriuresis relationship. The proposed studies have clinical relevance because they examine the link between autoantibody production and the development of hypertension in SLE, which may help to improve therapies for these patients. Furthermore, the presence of pathogenic autoantibodies in essential hypertension; thus, studies aimed at understanding the mechanistic role that autoantibodies have in hypertension may have broad implications for blood pressure control in multiple patient populations.  "

"9312908","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The purpose of this RFA is to promote the integration of experimental, analytic and theoretical capabilities for the examination of neural circuits and systems. This proposal is highly responsive to the RFA in that it links several different neuroscience labs to develop new technologies that provide for simultaneous multistate imaging and applies these technologies to the examination of how neuronal dynamics in mammalian cortex varies as a function of brain state and development. Paired imaging modalities will bridge the gap from imaging activity in individual neurons to whole brain circuit level analyses. The different scales will be linked with a comprehensive model such that each level of experimentation can inform the other. We will develop the technology to allow simultaneous single cell (two-photon) Ca2+ imaging of a local circuit and cortex-wide mesoscopic (single-photon) Ca2+ imaging across the entire neocortex. In separate paired studies in the same animals we will develop simultaneous mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging across the cortex with whole-brain functional MRI. Whole cortex mesoscopic Ca2+ imaging represents an innovative technology developed by one of the PIs (Crair) that uses mice expressing a genetically encoded Ca2+ indicator (GCaMP6) in all neurons or in select populations of neurons to allow both local neuronal and transcranial population level mesoscopic scale imaging across the cortex in the intact, unanesthetized developing mouse brain. This Ca2+ imaging technique will allow us to directly link single cell imaging to gross circuit level activity across the cortex and whole brain An integrative model is proposed to link these different modalities in order to understand the neural source of macroscopic circuit changes and the factors that influence this organization through development and as a function of behavioral brain state. This work is innovative in the novel Ca2+ imaging strategies to be further developed, and in the design of paired scale imaging to establish links between single neuron activity and circuit level organization. The work is significant in that it will provide a set of tools for detailed investigations of the impact of specific neuronal cell populations on brain circuit functional organization in healthy development and disease models. It is also significant in that new insights into the source and flow of neuronal activity will be obtained that will improve our understanding of the principles guiding self-organization in the developing brain and its dynamic modulation by brain state."
"9363788","Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome (SLOS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder that is caused by the most common inborn error of cholesterol biosynthesis at the step of 3?-hydroxysterol-?7-reductase (DHCR7). This defect leads to decreased levels of cholesterol and accumulation of its precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC), in affected individuals. SLOS phenotype manifests as multiple congenital malformations, neurological defects, and autistic behavior. Conventional therapy for SLOS is supplementation of cholesterol, with or without simvas- tatin, but these approaches do not improve neurological defects in patients. Recent findings suggested oxida- tive metabolites of 7-DHC, oxysterols, are important contributors to the pathogenesis of SLOS, but the patho- logical roles of these oxysterols in SLOS neurodevelopment have not been systematically studied, which is the gap that this project is expected to fill. The central hypothesis is that 7-DHC-derived oxysterols are causative factors for neurodevelopmental defects in SLOS. The long-term goals of this project are to elucidate the con- sequences of disrupted cholesterol homeostasis during neurodevelopment and to develop therapies that can ameliorate the neurological defects. In Aim 1, mechanisms of action of 7-DHC-derived oxysterols in neurogen- esis will be elucidated using neural progenitor cells (NPCs) derived from WT and Dhcr7-knock out (KO) mice and from WT and SLOS human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). The effects of Dhcr7 KO on neurogen- esis will be compared with the effects of 7-DHC oxysterols. Protein targets of 7-DHC oxysterols will be pulled down using synthetic tagged analogs of these oxysterols. In Aim 2, consequences of 7-DHC oxysterols on neural development will be determined in vivo using WT and Dhcr7-KO mouse models. The effects of Dhcr7 KO and those of oxysterols on neurogenesis in vivo will be compared using immunohistochemistry. Temporal and spatial distribution of sterols, oxysterols, and other lipids in both WT and Dhcr7-KO brains will be analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS) techniques, such as high-resolution ion mobility-MS and imaging MS. In Aim 3, effectiveness of blood-brain-barrier-permeable small molecules against neurological defects in SLOS will be evaluated using animal models and NPCs derived from SLOS iPSCs. The hypothesis here is that neurological defects in SLOS can be ameliorated by inhibiting the formation of 7-DHC-derived oxysterols with antioxidants and/or counteracting their effects using agonists of Hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway because some 7-DHC oxysterols antagonize Hh signaling. In addition, sterols, oxysterols, and other lipids in blood and fibroblast samples of SLOS patients from an ongoing antioxidant clinical trial will be characterized, aiming to identify bi- omarkers for assessing SLOS severity and therapy effectiveness. This project represents a new angle to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying the neurogenesis defects in SLOS and develop therapies for SLOS by targeting 7-DHC-derived oxysterols. The knowledge obtained from this project is expected to benefit other diseases associated with abnormal cholesterol biosynthesis or metabolism."

"9395557","Project abstract  Anthracycline (e.g. doxorubicin) induced cardiomyopathy (AIC) is a condition in which anthracycline toxicity leads to impaired myocardial function by causing direct myocardial toxicity. Anthracyclines are routinely used to treat breast cancer, lymphoma, and leukemia and carry a 7.8-8.8% risk of causing cardiomyopathy. Though therapies such as beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors can offer significant myocardial protection, AIC is associated with a 3.5 times greater relative risk of death than ischemic or idiopathic cardiomyopathy. New therapies are desperately needed and stem cell based technologies offer a novel approach to myocardial protection and repair.  This document proposes a study evaluating the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to preserve viability and function in AIC patient-specific induced cardiomyocytes (iCMs) after exposure to doxorubicin. For this study I am recruiting five AIC patients. Aim 1 will be to adapt an innovative iCM platform to predict the efficacy of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in treating AIC. To test this, MSCs will be co-cultured with AIC patient-specific ICMs in the presence of doxorubicin. iCM function and viability will then be rigorously assessed. Aim 2 will be to elucidate the mechanisms by which MSCs preserve myocardial viability and function after exposure to doxorubicin. To test this we will isolate exosomes from MSC culture and compare their ability to preserve AIC patient-specific iCM viability and function after exposure to doxorubicin to that of MSCs in co- culture. Lastly, I will sequence exosomal miRNAs to identify the specific mechanisms of endogenous repair utilized by MSCs and exosomes. This proposed study will improve our understanding of the role of MSCs in treating AIC and could potentially open doors for the development of much needed novel therapies for AIC."
"9359400","Project Summary  The Radiobiology and Imaging Program has been continuously approved by the NCI Cancer Center Support  Grant since 1987. The Program seeks to improve patient outcomes through the advanced understanding of  how ionizing and non-ionizing radiation interacts with cancer and normal tissues. The Programmatic goals are  to: (1) Study molecular mechanisms of radiation response and identify targets to improve radiotherapy. (2)  Elucidate mechanisms underlying use of Photodynamic Therapy (PDT) and translate to the clinic. (3) Develop  methods for measuring and altering tumor oxygenation and metabolic status; understand the molecular  events governing cell death by IR and physiological stresses. (4) Develop novel techniques to image the  interaction between radiation, PDT and tissues. (5) Understand the biological effects of protons to inform their  effective clinical use. The Program was rated as ?Exceptional? at the time of the 2010 CCSG renewal  application and is led by Constantinos Koumenis, PhD, Professor and Director of the Research Division of  Radiation Oncology and Amit Maity, MD, PhD, Professor of Radiation Oncology. Drs. Maity and Koumenis are  NCI-funded researchers who bring their scientific vision to this Program, which is focused on basic and  translational research and the development of investigator-initiated trials. Since the last renewal, the Co-  Leaders have recruited new junior and senior scientists, enhanced collaborative peer-reviewed funding and  increased the number of investigator-initiated clinical trials involving radiotherapy and imaging. Moreover, Drs.  Koumenis and Maity have steered the Program towards new areas of emphasis including combined radiation  and immunotherapy modalities and precision medicine and they have expanded the incorporation of imaging  modalities into basic and translational efforts. Through this process, they increased interactions with the  Immunobiology, Cancer Therapeutics, Breast Cancer and Cancer Control Programs. A major development  has been the substantial expansion of both translational and clinical studies of proton therapy. Program  members represent six departments from four schools at Penn. During the past five years, translational  research has continued to be a major focus. The 33 Program members have $7.7M in research grant funding  (annual direct costs), of which $7.5M is peer-reviewed and $3.7M is NCI-funded. There were a total of 405  cancer-related publications authored by Program members during the project period. Of these, 19% are intra-  Programmatic, 28% are inter-Programmatic and 53% are multi-institutional.      "
"9385247","PROJECT SUMMARY Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) is an essential therapeutic procedure used to enhance the outcome of patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplasia (MDS). Recent advances in alternative donor transplantation and supportive care have allowed for a greater number of older adults and those with co-morbidities to pursue potentially curative transplant procedures. In addition, the emerging era of targeted therapy allows for the development of novel disease remission induction regimens as well as transplant conditioning regimens that can enhance outcomes. However, relapse after allogeneic HCT remains a major barrier to successful outcomes, with recent data suggesting that up to 50% of allogeneic HCT failure and mortality relate to persistence or relapse of underlying disease. Recent advances in the detection of minimal residual disease (MRD) have enhanced the capacity of identifying some patients at risk of relapse after HCT. Using information obtained by cytogenetics, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and genomics, successful outcomes can still be achieved in a subset of myeloid malignancy patients transplanted in the setting of morphologically active or MRD-detectable disease at the time of transplant. This proposal is a pilot study to determine whether augmented genomic MRD assessment both before and after transplant for myeloid malignancies can be used to guide clinical investigators into offering post-HCT therapy. In so doing we hope to establish the importance of both pre- and post-HCT MRD and to begin to explore novel interventions for post-HCT MRD using a variety of cellular and/or pharmacologic-targeted approaches."
"9279241","Project summary  The use of chest auscultations to ?listen? to and diagnose lung infections has been in practice since the invention of the stethoscope in the early 1800s. While it is a versatile tool that is universally used to complement clinical observation and other diagnosis methods (e.g. chest palpation, X-rays), it remains an outdated technology that has not evolved much beyond its early design. Its use is limited by subjectivity and inconsistency in interpreting chest sounds, inter-listener variability, need for advanced medical expertise as well as vulnerability to ambient noise that masks the presence of sound patterns of interest.  In the current project, we propose to design a novel smart stethoscope to automate diagnosis of chest auscultations; especially for pediatric use. Over 2 million children die every year of acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI), the leading cause of childhood mortality worldwide. Our hypothesis is that if lung sounds are robustly acquired and analyzed, they are sufficiently informative to result in quantifiable improvements in detection accuracy of lung pathologies. By improving diagnosis capability using a low-cost technology, the proposed smart stethoscope will enhance resource and case management of ALRI, especially in impoverished settings that lack alternative diagnosis tools such as X-rays.  This proposal focuses on two key components for improving efficacy of lung auscultation diagnosis:  Aim 1: Designing the smart stethoscope technology. This effort takes a different engineering direction than devices currently on the market by employing novel transducer and microphone arrays in a layout that mitigates issues with ambient noise and signal stability. The expected outcome is to provide medical practitioners with a low-cost device that offers noise-control, signal amplification and stable recordings. We will test this technology at the Johns Hopkins Pediatric Emergency Hospital.  Aim 2: Augmenting the smart stethoscope with computer-aided diagnosis. We propose adaptive signal processing methods for analyzing lung signals to enable differentiating normal from pathological cases. The expected outcome is to improve the specificity and sensitivity of lung diagnosis using computer-aided analyses, and help inform clinical decisions and ALRI case management. The efficacy of the algorithm is directly evaluated in a study at a children's hospital in Peru, using radiographic pneumonia as benchmark. The site is chosen as representative of applicability of the proposed device in a low-resource setting.  The proposal is a multidisciplinary effort that draws upon the expertise of engineers and medical experts, with close interaction and ongoing validation in patient populations. Its overarching goal is to improve sensitivity and specificity of pulmonary diagnosis using auscultations. The overall outcome of this effort is a point-of-care technology that is effective, low-cost, and deployable for pulmonary-health monitoring in hospitals, clinics, low resource community centers, and potentially home-based monitoring."
"9312973","The objective of the In Vivo Animal and Human Studies core is to provide a venue for focusing human resources, facilities, new technology and equipment necessary for the in vivo study of humans and animals. The core serves to fully integrate investigations at the molecular, cellular, and organ system levels that are currently being performed within other cores of the Center and enhance rapid translation of basic discoveries into clinical application. The major services provided by the In Vivo Animal and Human Studies core are as follows:1. To provide a variety of acute and chronic animal models as well as state-of-the-art in vivo technologies to enhance rapid translation of basic discoveries to physiological and clinical applications; 2. To develop an organoid and enteroid program in which these preparations grown from mucosa biopsies and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) may be used to study epithelial cell biology and provide therapeutic targets for clinical intervention; 3. To support a clinical study program which will provide consultation and technical support to Center investigators on design and statistical data analysis; and 4. To provide a user friendly, one-step service to access digestive disease-related biospecimens for Center members. Since its inception in 1984, the In Vivo Animal and Human Studies core has evolved to meet the needs of Center investigators. Over time, older techniques which are readily available in clinical facilities have been discontinued by the Center. We have streamlined our animal studies to include ones that are frequently utilized by Center investigators. These include mice endoscopy, in vivo cellular and molecular imaging studies in small animals, fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, and electroporation for direct transfer of siRNA into targeted neuro-tissue or GI organs. The recent development of the Enteroid and Organoid core enables Center investigators to conduct research on in vitro models of human iPSCs, directed differentiation of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs), and 3-dimensional growth of primary human and mouse tissue delivered from the GI tract. These preparations may be used to study human GI development, homeostasis and disease in vitro. To enhance the rapid translation of basic science findings to clinical applications, the In Vivo Studies core has spent much of its efforts and resources to upgrade its infrastructure. The Clinical Design Program provides consultation regarding clinical study design, subject specification and sampling techniques, measurements and instruments, sample size estimation, power analysis, as well as data management and statistical analysis. The Biospecimen Banking service will provide support to enhance existing individual GI- related biobanks and develop future repositories. This service also centralizes, expedites, and facilitates access to GI-related biobanks and utilization of GI biospecimens to translate basic research within the paradigm of human specimens. During this funding period, the In Vivo Animal and Human Studies core has been used by 60% of its Center members, has supported 166 publications, with 55 being collaborative."
"9374958","Abstract Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that primarily affects the joints. Autoreactive immune cells enter articular joints as well as skeletal muscle, and inflammation of the synovial membrane damages the cartilage causing pain and discomfort. Disability rates from RA reach 40% from 5 to 10 years after diagnosis. In addition to disease activity and pain, muscle strength has a major impact on disability in RA patients. Skeletal muscle clearly contributes to RA disability, but the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. Since animal models and cell culture systems are imperfect replicates of human disease and do not recapitulate biologic and physiologic features of human skeletal muscle, we propose to use a recently developed engineered electrically responsive, contractile human muscle tissues (myobundles) to model RA in vitro and identify features of the disease phenotype. These human myobundles exhibit structural hallmarks of native skeletal muscle including aligned architecture, multinucleated and striated myofibers, and a satellite cell pool. Over four weeks in culture, they contract spontaneously and respond to single or high frequency electrical stimuli with twitch and tetanic contractions; myobundles maintain functional acetylcholine and ?-adrenergic receptors and undergo structural and functional maturation. Preliminary data with myoblasts derived from RA patients indicate that RA reduces the ability of myofibers to form and produce significant contractile force, even after removal of excess fibroblasts. To establish the in vitro system as a model to test therapies for the disease in skeletal muscle, we will extend our preliminary results and test the hypotheses hypotheses that (1) engineered skeletal muscle myobundles derived from cells of rheumatoid arthritis patients show reduced capacity for repair and differentiation and reduced force production; (2) the decrement in differentiation and function is due to select myokine and cytokine production; and (3) addition cytokines and myokines secreted by RA skeletal muscle myofibers can induce the RA phenotype in healthy myoblasts. In Aim 1, we will extend our preliminary results to show that the engineered skeletal muscle myobundles reproduce the disease phenotype and exhibit reduced maturation and capacity for force generation. Myobundles prepared with myoblasts from healthy aged-matched individuals will serve as controls. Results will be compared to immunohistochemical staining of biopsy samples to establish cellular changes in RA muscle. In Aim 2, we will use an unbiased approach and measure proteins and cytokines released from RA myobundles and apply statistical model to determine the relationship between features of RA phenotype identified in Aim 1 and the levels of myokines and cytokines. In Aim 3, we will that the hypothesis that the abnormal secretion of myokines and cytokines by RA muscle is responsible for the disease phenotype."
"9429172","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Giant Axonal Neuropathy (GAN, OMIM #256850) is a rare chronic neurodegenerative disease characterized by enlarged axons with disordered microtubules and intermediate filaments (IFs), which is fatal by the third decade of life. The disease pathology is due to homozygous loss-of- function mutations in the GAN gene, which encodes the protein gigaxonin. The underlying pathology is due to the disorganization and accumulation of IFs, including vimentin, alpha- internexin, neurofilaments, peripherin, and GFAP. GAN patients have normal cognitive function, and the most severe (and fatal) symptoms of GAN are the result of dysfunction and death of motor and sensory neurons in the spinal cord and DRG. The phenotypic contribution of IF dysfunction in other tissues such as the brain, autonomic nerves, and peripheral organs is poorly understood. Since 2008 we have been developing a gene transfer approach to treat GAN using intrathecal delivery of AAV9/GAN vectors, funded entirely by a small non-profit foundation called Hannah's Hope Fund. This effort culminated in a preIND (investigational new drug) meeting with the FDA in January 2012, and a RAC meeting for a proposed clinical trial in June 2013. Submission of an IND for a Phase I safety GAN gene therapy clinical trial is expected in summer of 2013, focused on rescuing spinal cord motor and sensory neurons. Sponsored by Hannah's Hope Fund, this trial will occur at the NIH Clinical Center under the direction of Dr. Carsten Bonnemann. This Phase I trial is aimed at establishing the safety of our general gigaxonin gene transfer approach in older patients that are eager to participate and otherwise untreatable. This patient population is made up of individuals that will be dead or too far progressed in their disease to participate in a late trial. While the Phase I trial is underway, this proposal aims to better characterize GAN in ways that could inform a Phase II/III trial and also identify new therapeutic targets if our approach needs to be modified. Further, it aims to optimize the gene transfer approach and develop a GAN knock-out rat."
"9287939","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Enhancement of Thai nurses' research capacity will successfully harness their roles as knowledge providers who can address critical health priorities in Thailand. Those priorities in Thailand are non-communicable diseases (NCDs) as they are projected to soon become the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in that country. There is a need for nursing and health systems research aimed at improving prevention, primary care, and long-term chronic disease management. The proposed program builds on a long standing collaboration between the UMSN and an institute within the MOPH, the Praboromarajchanok Institute for Health Workforce Development (PBRI). Instructors, mentors and advisors from both organizations will contribute to a varied and integrated training plan. The Specific Aims of this 5 year proposed training program are: 1. Provide a two year post-doctoral research training program in NCDs for 10 PhDs in nursing or related discipline; 2. Expand short term training (one to three months) for 40 PhD prepared investigators to strengthen their understanding of methodology, analysis and policy applications for NCDs research; 3. Provide forums for mid- and high- level research administrators within the MOPH and in universities and institutes of Thailand, to discuss methods and means to enhance and expand research capacity for NCDs in Thailand; 4. Provide a foundation of NCD research capacity in Thailand for potential expansion to the SEAR region.  Specific components of the program include: 1) A long-term postdoctoral research training program for 2 trainees per year including one year mentored research at the UM campus and one year mentored research project implementation in Thailand; 2) Short-term training of 1- 3 months for 8 trainees each year offering specific training options tailored to the trainees; and, 3) A yearly three- day research workshops in different geographical regions of Thailand.  The MOPH health delivery system, which encompasses nearly 90 percent of the Thai population, will be strengthened through nurse-led research with a focus on prevention, health promotion across the lifespan, and interventions at the individual, community, population and policy levels for NCDs. Specific emphasis will be on the most significant NCDs in Thailand at this time; cardiopulmonary and cardiovascular ischemic diseases and cancer with supporting areas such as pain management, clinical protocols for NCDs, and models of care delivery (e.g. implementation and effectiveness methodologies)."
"9389736","Project Summary Skeletal muscle atrophy is a major cause of disability and death in many chronic diseases, e.g. cancer, diabe- tes, and heart failure. Despite diverse etiology, atrophying muscles share many common features, like loss of mitochondrial content and depressed energetic state. One probable regulator of muscle mass and mitochon- dria during atrophy is the metabolic enzyme AMP deaminase (AMPD), which isoform 3 is increased up to 100- fold during atrophy. AMPD catalyzes the thermodynamically irreversible degradation of AMP and thereby also controls the size of the adenine nucleotide (ATP ? ADP ? AMP) pool. Binding or degrading AMP is particu- larly important since its free, cytosolic levels are detected by the energy sensing enzyme AMP-activated pro- tein kinase (AMPK), a well-described inducer of mitochondrial content. Thus, AMPD3 is uniquely positioned to modulate a major intracellular energetic signal, [AMP]/[ATP] ratio. To date, the molecular mechanisms that link muscle atrophy, cellular energetics, and mitochondria biogenesis are largely unknown. The long-term goal of this project is to identify new targets to increase muscle mass, mitochondrial content and perhaps improve the energetic state and function of atrophic muscle. The objective of this application is to determine whether during muscle atrophy AMPD3 decreases mitochondrial production and accelerates muscle protein loss. The central hypothesis is that high levels of AMPD3, which degrades the adenine nucleotide pool, triggers loss of mito- chondria and increases the rate of protein degradation. This is based, in part, on exciting preliminary data from cultured muscle showing that overexpression of AMPD3 mimics the energy deficit of atrophy, increases prote- olysis rate, and decreases protein content; while knockdown of AMDP3 in adult muscle protects against mus- cle weight loss of denervation atrophy. To test the central hypothesis, we propose to knockdown or remove AMPD3 in skeletal muscle fibers/cells that are non-atrophying or atrophying due to various energetic insults: either surgical denervation of one hindlimb (decreased energy demand), food deprivation (decreased energy supply), and glucocorticoid treatment (increase in demand and decrease in supply). The Aims of this proposal are to 1) To determine the role of AMP deaminase as a mediator of mitochondrial loss during skeletal muscle atrophy, and 2) determine the role of AMP deaminase as a mediator of protein loss during skeletal muscle at- rophy. The working hypotheses are that loss of AMPD3 during atrophy will increase [AMP], mitochondrial bio- genesis, and mitochondrial content. Conversely, overexpression of AMPD3, because of impairment in cellular energetics, will trigger accelerated protein degradation and muscle fiber size loss. The expected results of this proposal, demonstrating the energetic control of muscle atrophy, will not only provide novel insights into how energetics/metabolism and muscle mass are linked mechanistically, but will also be expected to reveal novel therapeutic targets to slow or stop muscle mass loss in most, if not all, atrophy conditions."
"9357648","Project 2 Summary   Genetic studies from our group has shown that mutations in the genes encoding either of two type I procollagen chaperones, FKBP10 (which encodes the FKBP65 protein) or SERPINH1 (which encodes HSP47), produce severe, recessively inherited forms of OI. Furthermore, we have determined that the two proteins form a complex acting on type I procollagen trimers in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and whose function is essential for normal type I procollagen biogenesis. Abrogation of the complex function leads to an altered cellular phenotype with dilated ER, aggregates of intracellular type I procollagen, sequestering of chaperone complex components and abnormal PLOD2-dependent cross-linking. Through the use of mutant FKBP65 and HSP47 cell lines, we have established that PLOD2 is also a member of this newly identified chaperone complex and identifies chaperone dysfunction as a new mechanism of disease in OI. These studies will primarily use newly generated mouse models, complemented by studies in human OI tissues to establish a currently unappreciated mechanistic paradigm for type I procollagen synthesis and a detailed understanding of how OI results from defects in this process. This is a paradigm shift in our understanding of type I procollagen synthesis from the viewpoint of how LH2 modifies or has access to type I procollagen and provides insight into how OI with contractures, also known as Bruck syndrome, can result from mutations in either FKBP10 or PLOD2. The proposed experiments are significant because they have the potential to have an extensive impact on our understanding of the role of telopeptide cross-linking plays in the generation of a functional extracellular matrix and will be essential to understanding and tailoring therapeutics in the context of altered bone matrix on downstream function of bone and associated tissues.      "
"9354203","Abstract: Prednisone and other glucocorticoids are considered standard of care for many chronic inflammatory states, and have been approved for some conditions since the 1950s. Prednisone also has a large side effect profile that can limit quality of life, particularly in children. Sleep disturbances are one of the known side effects, as pharmacological doses of prednisone disrupt normal circadian rhythms of endogenous cortisol (the day/night hormone of most organisms).The goal of this Pilot Project it to carry out two specific aims. The first aim will be to carry out a broad pharmacodynamic biomarker discovery, after a single dose of different doses of prednisone in young adult volunteers (1 mg, 2.5 mg, 10 mg dose groups; 10 subjects/dose), using day -1 time series samples as longitudinal controls. This will initiate defining a systems biology model of the pharmacodynamic effects of prednisone, and will test these at doses lower than have been reported for acute pharmacodynamic biomarkers in the literature (10 mg by Kauh et al. 2012), using a much broader biomarker discovery platform (1,300 proteins tested via SomaScan aptamer platform), and a much denser time series. This will initiate resolving cause/effect aspects of safety that have not been previously attempted via the time series approach. This will also aid in determining the subset of chronic pharmacodynamic safety biomarkers described in U54 RPDP Projects 1 and 2, that are acutely responsive to prednisone (within hours of a single dose). Aim 2 will query the effect of this single dose of prednisone on sleep patterns, using newly emerging mobile health devices (Microsoft Band). Through previous support of the Clark Charitable Trust Pilot Program, Drs. Hiroki Morizono (CNMC; bioinformatics), Roxanna Bendixen, MD (University of Pittsburgh, Occupational Therapist), and Mr. David Lorenzin (Florence, Italy; app developer) have piloted the Microsoft Band as a clinical outcome device in the community setting, including release of a novel app (CNBandDevice version 1.7.0.0). Here, we will study the sleep patterns of 30 adult volunteers using the Band device for 1 week prior to dosing, the evening of a single prednisone dose, and 1 week after dosing. This will begin to establish baseline data for sleep health of normal volunteers using the Microsoft Band, and determine if a single dose of prednisone induces a dose-response of sleep disturbances. Completion of this Pilot Project will train Dr. Benny Klimek in clinical research (she is currently a basic scientist). While the cost of this pilot cost surpasses the budget permitted in the U54 RPDP pilot, Dr. Benny Klimek received a $70,000 planning grant for this Pilot from the Clark Charitable Trust Pilot Program in 2015, enabling writing of protocols and IRB submissions, and initial training in clinical research. Thus, with the 2 yr pilot funds (@$50,000/yr), completion of this ambitious pilot is feasible."
"9359530","Summary Core D will conduct all protein-related analyses for Projects 1, 2, and 3. Human urine samples will be collected by Projects 1 and 2 from highly selected and well-characterized stone-former and normal patient pools. Human kidney interstitial tissue will be collected by biopsy (Project 2) and subsequent laser microdissection (LMD) (Project 3) from those same patient pools. We will quantify inflammation in the urine samples using high sensitivity multiplexed magnetic particle-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (MP-ELISA) assays in 1) idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH) of both papillary types and in normal subjects with high salt diet; 2) conditions of high and low sodium diets with and without potassium citrate; 3) whether high papillary injury scores correlate with inflammation in either urine or LMD samples; 4) patients with and without non-obstructive stone pain; and 5) patients with non-obstructive stone pain before and after surgical removal of collecting duct plugs. Exploiting our ability to obtain highly homogeneous LMD samples, we will use MP-ELISA to measure key toll-like receptor pathway-related molecules in the interstitium and thin limb cells away from and near plaque. We will measure osteopontin, THP, CD59, bikunin, and calgranulin (A, B and C) expression in regions of plaque and crystal-free interstitium near plaque and compare them to non-stone forming controls. We will assess oxidative injury in areas near or distant from plaque compared to plugging by targeting oxidized proteins and quantifying them by LFQMS of biotin hydrazide-derivatized protein carbonyls. We will also exploit our unique ability to combine sensitive LFQMS with the specificity of LMD to investigate currently unknown pathways or cellular mechanisms of plugging or plaque that could serve as biomarker panels or drug targets. We will analyze regions of interstitium from papillary biopsies that do and do not contain apatite plaque comparing affected areas to non- affected sites within the same individuals in the papillae with plaque and/or plugging calcium stone disease and extend these investigations to plaque overgrowth sites to identify and quantify proteins unique to Randall's plaque to examine the protein content of the plaque-stone interface"

"9320738","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Age-related macular degeneration and other macular diseases commonly lead to irreversible loss of the central visual field. In these cases of central field loss (CFL), patients must rely on peripheral vision to recognize objects, identify faces, and read. However, performance on these form vision tasks is far worse than the reduced spatial resolution in peripheral vision predicts. The causes of this excess impairment are not well understood. Further, we do not know to what extent changes can be induced in the peripheral visual system to alleviate these impairments over the long term, nor do we understand the nature of such plasticity.  A basic understanding of peripheral form vision is necessary if we are to develop effective rehabilitation regimens and adaptive technologies for patients with central vision loss. An equally important advance would be to understand why form vision is qualitatively inferior in peripheral compared to central vision. The proposed study aims to make foundational advances in our understanding of peripheral form vision, and does so in a way that is relevant for the condition of CFL. We propose to study peripheral form vision from the perspective of active vision, where oculomotor control plays a central role. Specifically, we will focus on the interaction between plasticity in visual crowding, a key form vision deficit in the periphery, and changes in oculomotor strategy induced by CFL. We will begin by testing a novel theory that links crowding in normal peripheral vision to image statistics that have been acquired under the influence of saccadic eye movements. We will build an image-encoding model of early visual processing stages based on the theoretical framework we recently developed. This model of peripheral form vision will be validated quantitatively against a diverse set of findings on crowding in the literature. Separately, we will test a new theory of oculomotor development that describes the formation of the preferred retinal locus (PRL), which is a common adjustment in CFL. The image-encoding model will enable us to predict the nature of form vision plasticity given a PRL. This research project thus stands to provide the first comprehensive theory of peripheral form vision in the context of central field loss. In addition, it will produce a rich an unique data set on peripheral form vision and oculomotor adaptation that will inform other investigations of peripheral form vision."

"9385387","Abstract  To address the concern that few hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) patients, especially allogeneic HCT patients, enter clinical trials to explore strategies to improve outcomes, the NHLBI and NCI chartered the Blood and Marrow Clinical Trials Network (BMT CTN) in 2001. Aim 1of this application proposes continuation of participation of the UF Consortium, consisting of the University of Florida (UF) and Emory University (EU), as a core consortium of the BMT CTN for continued participation in multiple ongoing trials and trials to be implemented in the next funding cycle. The UF Consortium performs >600 HCTs annually. The UF Consortium has been a highly effective core center since the BMT CTN's inception in 2001 with a proven track record of consistently meeting or exceeding all annual BMT CTN performance standards. The UF Consortium has participated in 41 of 42 BMT CTN trials, has consistently exceeded annual target enrollments, has been in the top 25% of core centers/consortia in enrollment during the current funding cycle, and has doubled its enrollments to BMT CTN trials during the past funding cycle. Drs. Wingard and Waller and other UF consortium investigators have provided strong scientific leadership, authoring 25 publications (4 as first author and 3 as senior author), serving on 14 Protocol Committees (2 as PI), 6 Endpoint Review Committees, and 7 Administrative and Technical Committees (serving as chair of 3). Both have served in leadership roles in the NIH State of Science Symposia. Data reporting error rates have been well below the targeted error rate for the BMT CTN studies (2.0 % or lower). Similarly, timeliness of reports has exceeded CTN acceptance standards. The advantage of the UF Consortium is that this core will be able to continue to expand its accrual to BMT CTN trials. Unique strengths the UF Consortium brings to this next cycle of funding is access to large numbers of Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) patients, robust interactions of each HCT team with SCD collaborators, an experienced immune reconstitution laboratory, dendritic cell manufacturing and other novel cell therapy manufacturing capacity at both sites with multiple ongoing cell vaccine/HCT trials at both sites.  Aim 2 of this application proposes a protocol concept to address 2 high priority research topics identified in the States of Science Symposia: graft versus host disease (GVHD) and infection. Alterations in the diversity of the gut microbiota after allogeneic HCT are associated with risks for serious infections, GVHD, treatment- related mortality, pulmonary complications and relapse. Indole compounds, produced by the intestinal microbiota, have immunoregulatory properties. Pilot murine studies by us indicate the ability of an indole prebiotic to reduce the risk for GVHD while preserving graft versus leukemia effects. In this application we propose to test an indole prebiotic intervention to prevent GVHD and serious infection, first in a randomized phase 2 trial to assess feasibility in a multicenter setting, then in a phase 3 randomized trial. This novel approach to prevent GVHD offers the prospect to avoid toxicities of current immunosuppressive regimens."
"9397228","Project Summary The human gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori infects half the world?s population and is remarkably persistent, able to avoid clearance by the immune system for the duration of an individual?s lifetime. Chronic infection by the bacterial pathogen is now known to be the major cause of peptic ulcers and is associated with the development of adenocarcinoma. A simple chemotaxis system allows H. pylori to survive in the harsh environment of the stomach by navigating toward beneficial chemicals and away from harmful ones, yet the mechanism of this process is poorly understood. Emerging evidence has unexpectedly revealed that chemotaxis by a cytosolic receptor TlpD plays an important role in H. pylori colonization. Most previous work has focused on membrane-bound chemoreceptors, even though cytosolic chemoreceptors are common amongst prokaryotes. The cytosolic receptor TlpD has been shown to sense reactive oxygen species (ROS) and is essential for H. pylori to colonize and grow normally in the stomach antrum. We hypothesize H. pylori uses its cytosolic chemoreceptor TlpD to sense ROS excreted by immune cells and that this allows it to avoid killing by host macrophage and neutrophils. We propose to test this hypothesis with a combined molecular-level and cellular- level approach. Specific Aims: (1) Test the hypothesis that hydrogen peroxide induces a structural change in TlpD that facilitates signal transduction. (2) Test the hypothesis that ROS-sensing by TlpD provides a survivorship advantage by detecting and evading host immune cells. Research Design: To understand the function of TlpD, we will use biophysical approaches like fluorescence anisotropy, analytical ultracentrifugation, and protein crystallography to examine the interactions of the receptor with other chemotaxis proteins, and determine the molecular mechanism by which the receptor senses ROS and transmits this signal to chemotaxis kinases. We will apply this knowledge to understand the pathogen?s behavior in vivo by engineering mutant H. pylori strains and testing their ability to sense ROS. I will assess whether immune cells produce a chemical signal detectable by H. pylori, and if TlpD confers a survivorship advantage by facilitating chemorepulsion from neutrophils and macrophage. This research will improve understanding of the biologically and medically important process of chemotaxis for H. pylori, and lay the foundation to target elements of the chemotaxis system with novel therapeutics. Our broad long term goal is to advance the field of bacterial chemotaxis by elucidating the mechanism by which a cytosolic receptor can sense an extracellular signal."
"9314570","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lack of haptic feedback has been identified as a barrier to adoption of robotic platforms, particularly during gastrointestinal procedures as they require both grasping and shear sensation to perform delicate anastomoses and dissections. The present proposal will further develop the capabilities of a Haptic Feedback System (HFS) to deliver this bi-axial sensory information from the surgical graspers to the fingertips of the operating surgeon in a robotic platform. The current HFS detects grasping forces via piezoresistive sensors, delivering this signal wirelessly through pneumatic balloon actuators. Previous results have shown that when using the HFS surgeons perform tasks more quickly with decreased grasping force, thereby resulting in decreased tissue damage. However, the current system is limited by its size and its uniaxial capabilities. Thus, novel capacitive tooth sensor microarrays were developed resulting in a wider range of force sensation along with an improved ability to withstand biological environments. Based on this superior performance, we have designed a bi-axial microarray to accommodate both grasping and shear forces. The present studies will fabricate these sensor arrays, characterize and integrate them within the current HFS framework, and evaluate their impact in gastrointestinal procedures. Specifically, we focus on the RouxenY Gastric Bypass as it has recently garnered more support in translation to the robotic platform. We will evaluate the effect of auxiliary haptic feedback on grp force, shear force, anastomosis integrity, surgical duration, surgical complications, and tissue damage in a porcine model. In addition, we will perform human feasibility trials for Totally Robotic RouxenY Gastric Bypass with haptic feedback to further translate the HFS towards comprehensive clinical trials."
"9387489","ABSTRACT There are over 2.5 million patients with cirrhosis, with an annual incidence of 40,000 and about 27,000 deaths per year. Most patients do not get transplanted and management of complications remains the mainstay of therapy for cirrhosis. Skeletal muscle loss is the most frequent complication in cirrhosis and results in reduced quality of life, increased morbidity and mortality. Despite the high clinical significance of muscle loss in cirrhosis, there are no established therapies because the underlying mechanisms are not known. Identifying the mechanisms of skeletal muscle loss in cirrhosis is therefore of high clinical significance. Hyperammonemia is a consistent abnormality in cirrhosis because of reduced hepatic ureagenesis and portosystemic shunting. We have previously reported that ammonia decreases muscle protein synthesis. In preliminary studies, we show that hyperammonemia results in impaired ?-catenin signaling and decreased expression of its target, c- MYC. Canonical regulation of ?-catenin is mediated by GSK3? mediated phosphorylation. Interestingly, we noted that ammonia activates IKK? and decreases ?-catenin expression and transcriptional activity independent of GSK3?. We also showed that ammonia inhibits ?-catenin by a novel, non-canonical IKK? dependent mechanism. In the muscle, cMYC increases protein synthesis and muscle hypertrophy via activation of ribosomal biogenesis. However, whether lower ?-catenin and consequent reduced cMYC expression and activity result in muscle loss is not known. The studies proposed in this application will aim to identify the molecular mechanisms by which ammonia impairs ?-catenin signaling and the perturbations in the ribosomal biogenesis pathways. Based on compelling preliminary data generated in a comprehensive array of models with muscle hyperammonemia including human cirrhosis, portacaval anastamosis (PCA) rat and C2C12 myotube cultures, we hypothesize that reduced skeletal muscle ribosomal biogenesis and protein synthesis during hyperammonemia are mediated by a non-canonical IKK? dependent impaired ?-catenin signaling. We will examine this hypothesis by loss and gain of function studies in rodent and cell culture models by the following aims: First we will identify the mechanism by which hyperammonemia impairs ?- catenin signaling by a non-canonical IKK?-mediated mechanism. In-vivo silencing of IKK? in the PCA rat and molecular studies in myotubes will be used to dissect the mechanisms of inactivation of ?-catenin. Second, we will determine the mechanism by which hyperammonemia decreases ribosomal biogenesis, the critical step in protein synthesis, via the c-MYC transcriptional complex of ribosomal proteins. We will determine the mechanism by which ammonia inhibits the ?-catenin-cMYC-ribosome biogenesis in murine myotubes and C2C12 myotubes by loss and gain in function studies. Our studies will determine the molecular mechanisms responsible for impaired muscle protein synthesis and provide the basis for developing novel interventions to reverse muscle loss in cirrhosis and other chronic diseases with hyperammonemia including heart failure."
"9531755","Peripheral nerve injury is common and occurs due to a variety of causes including trauma, diabetes, cancer chemotherapy, autoimmune reactions, and genetic disorders. Although peripheral neurons are capable of regenerating, this process is generally incomplete. It is therefore crucial to determine ways in which regener- ation can be enhanced. Macrophages are thought to promote peripheral nerve regeneration after an acute injury due to their accumulation in the distal nerve where they phagocytize axonal debris and myelin thereby creating an environment through which axons can grow. In addition, macrophages secrete cytokines that trigger growth factor synthesis in non-neuronal cells in the nerve. The absence of these actions has been assumed to be the basis for the slow regeneration that occurs in the slowly degenerating Wlds mouse. How- ever, it has been known for 20 years. In part due to our studies. that there is a second, distinct, site of mac- rophage accumulation after injury, namely, peripheral ganglia such as dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) where the axotomized cell bodies reside. What has remained unknown is what function these macrophages subserve. Recent studies from our lab represent a major advance in answering this question. Work with two mutant mouse strains, a knockout for the chemokine receptor CCR2 and the Wlds mice led to the hypothesis that macrophage accumulation in ganglia is required for the occurrence of the conditioning lesion (CL) response, the response in which neurite outgrowth after a lesion is increased as a consequence of an earlier condition- ing lesion. This application is designed to test the following overall model: macrophages brought into the DRG by the chemokine CCL2 trigger the expression of regeneration associated genes (RAGs) via the secretion of cytokines around axotomized cell bodies and this promotes the CL response and regen- eration in addition to any effects macrophages have on the distal nerve. To establish beyond doubt that CCL2-dependent macrophage accumulation and the CCL2-dependent CL response are causally related, we will use an inhibitor of colony stimulating factor 1 receptors to deplete circulating monocytes. To deter- mine whether macrophages act directly on neuronal cell bodies, we will use microfluidic chambers in which a neuron?s cell body and axon can be separated. Gene expression using RNAseq will be compared after ax- otomy in CCRs -/- and wild type animals to determine which axotomy-induced genes are dependent on mac- rophage accumulation. Since we have shown that Wallerian degeneration is normal in CCR2 -/- mice but monocyte infiltration into DRGs is blocked, these animals will allow us to determine whether macrophage accumulation in DRGs is required for sensory nerve regeneration in vivo. Using these novel approaches, we will examine the mechanisms underlying the relationship between macrophage accumulation near axoto- mized cell bodies and axonal growth. Emphasizing ganglia, unexplored sites of neuroinflammation, repre- sents a paradigm shift from the traditional view that focuses on macrophage effects on the distal nerve."
"9313004","PROJECT SUMMARY (GENETICALLY MODIFIED MOUSE CORE) The significant incidence of digestive, liver and pancreatic diseases in the American population demands continued exploration of a broad array of corresponding mechanistic pathways, pathophysiologic sequelae, and potential therapeutic approaches. In many cases these investigations can only be accomplished, or can be accomplished most efficiently and relevantly, using model systems established in intact animals. The use of mouse models in these pursuits is now well established for their power, feasibility, flexibility, and enormous potential. Creation of such models, by targeted alterations of the mouse genome, is an essential component of an overall research effort in understanding normal functions and pathologic perturbations in the digestive tract, liver, and pancreas. The Genetically Modified Mouse Core (GMMC) provides investigators of the University of Pennsylvania Center for the Molecular Study of Digestive and Liver Diseases (CMSDLD) with the ability to carry out these technologically-demanding studies in a cost effective and efficient manner and enhance the rigor and relevance of these approaches. The GMMC has a dedicated and highly skilled staff that applies state-of-the-art equipment and techniques, and the facility consists of a microinjection suite, an adjacent dedicated cage room, and an off-site and highly secure cryopreservation storage facility. Major services available to CMSDLD investigators include the generation of transgenic mice by DNA pronuclear injection, creation of chimeric mice by ES cell injection into blastocysts, and direct genome mutation, editing, and modification via the use of targeted endonuclease (TALEN and Crispr-CAS technologies); these are complemented by the genotyping of founder mice, assisted (in vitro) fertilization, cryopreservation, long-term cryostorage, and shipping of frozen embryos or sperm to/from other facilities. To provide these services, the GMMC utilizes multiple microinjection platforms, laser-assisted technologies, state-of-the-art cryopreservation approaches, and highly efficient line re-derivation pipelines. All functions, from ordering services, to following workflow, to storing and sending out lines, are on-line and can be monitored in real-time. These efforts by the GMMC contribute substantially to the overall productivity of CMSDLD investigators and enhance the rigor and relevance of their studies to the mechanisms of digestive, liver, and pancreatic diseases in physiologically- intact mammalian systems. Moreover, the GMMC enhances interactions and collaborations for CMSDLD investigators and lowers the technical and financial barriers that would otherwise impede the application of these approaches for individual investigators. Thus the Genetically Modified Mouse Core contributes greatly to the research efforts of the CMSDLD."
"9280991","Differential mechano-signaling in vascular endothelium by varying degrees of mechanical stretch Excessive mechanical forces imposed on the microvascular endothelium lead to increased microvascular permeability accompanying life-threatening conditions such as stroke, pulmonary hypertension, or ventilator induced lung injury, to name a few. We have previously characterized signaling pathways induced in vascular endothelium by high magnitude cyclic stretch (CS) and described a key role of Rho GTPase in high CS- induced endothelial barrier dysfunction. However, cellular mechanotransduction complexes which transform mechanical signals to cellular responses remain to be characterized. Our unpublished pilot studies indicate that Rap1 signaling is activated by physiologically relevant low magnitude (5%) CS and promotes re-assembly of tight junctions disrupted by cell preconditioning at pathologically relevant high magnitude (18%) CS. The preliminary data also suggest that low CS-induced EC barrier restoration is associated with accumulation of adaptor protein cingulin at the tight junctions and formation of cingulin-GEF-H1 complex. The central hypothesis tested in this application is that recovery of vascular endothelial barrier after pathologic mechanical stress may be accelerated by cell exposure to physiologic CS levels and involves Rap1-dependent reassembly of endothelial tight junctions, recruitment of cingulin to the tight junctions, and stimulation of cingulin - GEF-H1 interaction. These events lead to inhibition of GEF-H1 nucleotide exchange activity, suppression of Rho- dependent barrier disruptive mechanisms, and accelerated recovery of the vascular endothelial barrier. The following questions will be addressed: Aim-1 will study cingulin-dependent mechanisms of endothelial barrier regulation by physiologic mechanical stretch. Aim-2 will study the role of cingulin in downregulation of the Rho pathway in mechanically stimulated microvascular endothelium after a switch from pathologic to physiologic CS amplitude. Aim-3 will evaluate cingulin-dependent vascular protective mechanisms in a mouse model of mechanical ventilation."
"9316598","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) encompass a wide range of symptoms including urinary incontinence, urinary frequency, urgency, nocturia, bladder pain syndrome, and symptoms of voiding dysfunction. There is an extensive literature describing the many approaches to treatment of LUTS, but much less is known about prevention. Epidemiological studies have identified numerous risk factors for LUTS, but evidence is lacking for the roles of behavioral factors, including how we learn our bladder habits, whether they affect the risk of developing LUTS, and what defines healthy bladder habits. The primary aim of this proposal is to participate as a Clinical Center in the Prevention of Lower Urinary Tract Symptoms in Women: Bladder Health Clinical Centers (PLUS) Research Consortium and work with other centers to examine the existing evidence and plan foundational studies for development of future trials of prevention interventions for LUTS. The University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Continence Team is an interdisciplinary group of investigators from behavioral science, geriatrics, preventive medicine, public health, urogynecology, and urology. Our epidemiological work includes identifying risk factors for incident incontinence using the NIA-funded UAB longitudinal Study of Aging, national VA databases, and risk factor analyses of NHANES data. The depth of the UAB team covers all aspects of LUTS clinical trial design and conduct (including NIH multi-site networks), evaluation and treatment of LUTS in women, and a strong track record of recruitment and retention of both patients and control subjects (including being a Vanguard Center for the NHLBI Women's Health Initiative). The second aim is to address known gaps in current epidemiological knowledge, through a prospective longitudinal cohort study to assess a range of behavioral factors and their effect on the incidence and progression of LUTS. Understanding the roles of bladder health behaviors will support the development of a risk model for identifying individuals and groups at risk for LUTS, as well as inform public education initiatives. The third aim is to conduct foundational studies guided by our conceptual framework to develop three potential pathways to prevention of LUTS: public education initiatives targeted across the lifespan to convey knowledge and dispel myths about healthy bladder habits and LUTS; skill-based interventions for young women and at-risk groups to teach evidence-based behavioral skills and healthy bladder habits; and detection of and self-administered interventions for early LUTS. The plan of studies includes 1) the longitudinal cohort study, which will also provide meaningful content for public education campaigns, 2) a survey of providers to assess feasibility of teaching pelvic floor muscle control and healthy bladder habits to young women at a time of relative readiness - the first gynecology encounter, and 3) developing and pilot testing an internet-based, self-administered behavioral intervention including a smart-phone application as a practical first step in addressing early LUTS. Findings from these studies will lay the foundation for future trials of interventions to prevent LUTS in women across the lifespan."

"9307872","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):   Here we propose to establish a National Center for Functional Glycomics (NCFG) that is focused on 5 major objectives; Technology Research and Development (TR&D); Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) tied to TR&D Projects; Collaborative Services; Training; and Dissemination of Technologies and Research Discoveries. The development of this application is an outgrowth of the very successful leadership provided by the Glycomics Center at Emory University School of Medicine, which housed the Protein-Glycan Interaction Core (Core H) of the successful Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), a unique NIGMS-funded resource from 2001-2011 that has been utilized by hundreds of investigators worldwide. The Center's applications of the CFG's Defined Glycan Microarray, which has received >800 requests for analyses in the past 8 years, has revolutionized studies on protein-glycan interactions. Defined glycan microarrays have become the benchmark in studying the glycan-binding specificity of lectins, antibodies, and viruses, which for this grant application are termed glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). The value of immobilized glycans in studying GBPs and functional glycomics is evidenced by the collaborations already established in the Center with over 600 Principal Investigators worldwide, resulting in >350 peer-reviewed publications in the past 8 years. Over the past several years, the members of the Glycomics Center at Emory, who are the lead investigators in this proposed NCFG, have provided innovative leadership in developing technologies for studying the functions of cellular glycomes and for glycomic analyses. In the 3 TR&D Projects proposed for this NCFG, we will 1) expand glycan microarray technologies, 2) develop Shotgun Glycomics as a general method for studying natural cell-derived glycan recognition, and 3) develop different glycan display technologies, as well as cellular avatars - particles that represent cellular glycomes in unique presentations. The DBPs include studies on the roles of glycans in microbial and viral infections, glycans and GBPs in cell adhesion, innate and adaptive immune responses, and recognition factors within the glycocalyx that contribute to GBP interactions. The NCFG will use these advances to drive a strong Collaborative Service component to aid the biomedical research community in the using and developing of glycan microarrays and other approaches to explore glycan recognition. We will offer a robust Training program, as well as initiate multiple venues and strategies to Disseminate the technological and scientific developments in the NCFG."

"9324983","Project Summary / Abstract ? Core F. Microbiome Core The Microbiome Core will provide analytical tools to investigators to permit determination of the structure of the microbiome in mouse models of disease. In addition, the Microbiome Core will provide assistance in the cultivation of microbes that will permit hypothesis testing in murine models including the germfree animals that are available in the Animal Phenotyping Core. In addition to providing instrumental infrastructure, the Core staff will provide consultation and collaboration to apply microbiome analysis in mouse models of disease. The Microbiome Core will optimize efficiency and cost-effectiveness by providing these services to investigators through a central laboratory. This avoids the need for individual investigators to purchase and maintain high price instrumentation in their own laboratories and avoids the high cost of commercial analytical services. In the past 6 years we have standardized and implemented several analytical techniques for the analysis of microbial communities in a culture-independent manner, leveraging advances in high through nucleic acid sequencing. We are particularly interested in addressing three areas of need: first, applying culture- independent techniques to study the structure and dynamics of complex microbial communities; second, utilizing advanced techniques in microbial cultivation to permit hypothesis testing and understanding the role of bacterial metabolism; and three, providing training for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows with an interest in utilizing microbiome analysis in their research. By centralizing and standardizing procedures, the Core provides a common set of analytical tools that will lead to a unified understanding of molecular mechanisms by which microbes and communities of microbes can contribute to health and disease."
"9359394","Project Summary  The Tumor Biology Program aims to catalyze research within the ACC to advance understanding of the  molecular mechanisms underlying cancer pathogenesis and to translate this knowledge to identify new and  more effective preventive, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic approaches. This Program, which was  founded in the early 1970s, continues to progressively respond to advances in cancer research. Its overarching  scientific aims are to: 1) Elucidate the molecular and cellular basis of carcinogenesis, and 2) Translate these  findings into durable clinical applications. To that end, the Program is organized around three central goals or  themes: 1) Structural biology of molecules relevant to cancer, 2) The molecular and cellular basis of cancer,  and 3) The use of model organisms to study cancer in vivo. Interactive, intra-Programmatic scientific affinity  groups foster collaboration within and across themes, including: 1) Tthe tumor microenvironment, 2) RNA  biology, 3) DNA repair and genomic stability, 4) Cancer cell metabolism (this spawned a new ACC Basic  Science Center of Excellence), and 5) Organ-specific cancers, such as pancreatic (this has been integrated  into the new ACC Pancreatic Translational Center of Excellence). The Program continues under the strong  leadership of Anil Rustgi, MD, who fosters deep and impactful intra- and inter-Programmatic collaborative  relationships. Program Leadership is also instrumental in recruiting new members (e.g., Drs. Berger, Feldser,  Garcia, and Puré), mentoring junior faculty, establishing scientific affinity groups to leverage and further  develop common research interests among faculty members, and organizing conferences and symposia.  Program members are extremely actively involved in the training and mentorship of PhD students, MD/PhD  students, and MD or PhD postdoctoral fellows by virtue of their leadership roles in the Penn Biomedical  Graduate Studies, MD/PhD (MSTP) program and NIH T32 training grants. Program Leadership was highly  successful in harnessing Institutional support to catalyze a tumor biology translational research initiative and  increased translational research has been pursued in both thematic and organ-specific contexts. Its success is  evident in the emergence of new transdisciplinary, disease-specific collaborations that join Program members  with colleagues in Clinical Research and Population Science to study cancers, such as pancreatic and  esophageal, in which there is an unmet need for improved diagnosis and treatment. Currently, the Program  has 50 members from 16 departments and four different schools with total funding of $22M (annual direct  costs) of which $18.7M is peer-reviewed and $5.6M is NCI-funded. Since 2010, members published 466  cancer-related papers, of which 15% were intra-Programmatic, 32% were inter-Programmatic, and 30% were  multi-institutional."

"9473856","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Despite advances in deciphering the molecular pathogenesis of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) disease, particularly those with adverse genetic features (e.g., mutant p53 or FLT3-ITD) have grim prognoses, and effective therapies are lacking. Wee1, a critical cell cycle checkpoint kinase, has been identified as a target in AML by integrative genomic analysis; however, AZD1775, the first-in-class clinically relevant oral Wee1 inhibitor, has thus far been used primarily to potentiate genotoxic agent activity in p53-deficient solid tumors. Histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs), epigenetic agents that induce tumor cell death through multiple mechanisms of action (MOAs), are approved for the treatment of CTCL/PTCL and have now been granted Orphan Drug status in AML. Recent attention has focused on novel MOAs of HDACIs involving disruption of the DNA damage response (DDR), including checkpoints and repair (e.g., HR and NHEJ). Our group discovered that AZD1775 interacts reciprocally and synergistically with pan- HDACIs (e.g., Belinostat) to kill human leukemia cells independently of p53 status, including those bearing FLT3-ITD. Of note, HDACI co-administration induced pronounced Wee1 and Chk1 inactivation, cdc2/Cdk1 dephosphorylation/activation at both Tyr15 and Thr14 sites, premature mitotic entry, and G1/S checkpoint abrogation, resulting in robust DNA damage (gamma-H2A.X) and apoptosis. Significantly, these interactions also occurred in primary AML cells harboring various NGS-defined mutations (e.g., p53, FLT3) and primitive AML progenitors, spared normal hematopoietic cells, and improved survival in vivo in mouse AML models. We now propose to translate these promising findings into the clinic through three Specific Aims. In Stage 1a(UH2a), we will validate in vivo MOAs for the AZD1775/ pan-HDACI Belinostat regimen e.g., Wee1 and Chk1 dephosphorylation/inactivation, cdc2/Cdk1 dephosphorylation/activation, and Bim, p-H3, and gamma-H2A.X up- regulation in AML xenograft models as candidate PD response determinants in subsequent trials in humans. In Stage #1b (UH2b), we will conduct a phase Ib trial of AZD1775/Belinostat in patients with R/R AML/MDS/CML-BC in order to identify the RPTD and characterize toxicities. The trial will also provide preliminary signals of activity and test the feasibility of NGS genomic profiling and PD/PK analysis as candidate biomarkers/response determinants. In Stage #2 (UH3), if indicated, we will conduct a two-stage phase IIa trial of the regimen to assess activity more definitively, and to determine whether specific genetic aberrations (e.g. in p53, FLT3) or correlative PD/PK studies can identify patients most likely to respond. Successful completion of these aims will introduce a novel and potentially effective Wee1/HDAC inhibitory strategy based on reciprocal disruption of the DDR, upon which leukemia cells with poor-prognostic mutations depend, into the therapeutic armamentarium for R/R AML, a disease for which satisfactory therapy is currently lacking. It may also provide a foundation for the more personalized use of this strategy in AML based on NGS/PD analysis."

Today, WHO counts 194 Member States. WHO fulfills its objectives through six core functions, which include the shaping of the research agenda and stimulating the generation, translation and dissemination of valuable knowledge.  WHO's roles and responsibilities in health research have recently been endorsed by the World Health Assembly. WHO utilizes its decentralized structure to implement its research efforts at global, regional and country level. To achieve its objectives related to research, WHO maintains effective collaboration with governmental and other research organizations throughout the world, as evidenced by the network of WHO Collaborating Centers. Covering programs on communicable and non-communicable diseases, endemic, epidemic as well as emerging health threats,  WHO addresses a research portfolio with broad complementarity to the goals of NIH and many of its 27 centers and specialized institutes. Based on a track-record of fruitful collaboration between WHO and NIH, the objective of this application is to support a framework of enhanced collaboration in the area of biomedical research. Working towards shared goals of WHO and NIH, it is intended is to build on the respective strengths of both Organizations. In the field of biomedical research, NIH's more basic research emphasis combines with WHO's application oriented research efforts, and its support to research-related training efforts, the fostering of research-related resources, the dissemination of scientific knowledge and the assessment of health-related research and good practices. To implement the proposed collaborative effort, WHO relies on its very broad program experience, its experience as research sponsor, its ability to convene world-leading experts and manage transparent an independent consultation processes, its decentralized infrastructure comprising six regional offices and 146 country offices, and a continuous programmatic and financial commitment. Within the financial limits of this RFA, WHO proposes to conduct annual expert consultations on the assessment and application of novel and innovative biomedical research findings for the development of priority public health interventions in low and middle income countries. There is very significant room for expansion of collaborative activities in support of both institutions shared goals and objectives."
"9507445","The All of Us Research Program has an explicit goal to enroll at least 1 million people from all communities to reflect the rich diversity of our nation. To truly engage our broad national diversity, a specific focus on sexual and gender minority (SGM) individuals is critical. Engaging SGM people will help ensure equitable representation of the US population in All of Us, biological heterogeneity for high-quality discovery science, and diverse input in All of Us-based research via citizen-scientists and traditional researchers. Our proposal aims to engage SGM people on a national scale to help the All of Us Research Program realize its ambitious goals. SGM people ? including members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) communities ? are everywhere, demographically diverse, and represent all segments of society. SGM people account for an estimated 4.1% (~13 million people) of the US population. SGM individuals compose an identity-based population that includes sexual minorities (individuals with a sexual orientation that is not heterosexual) and gender minorities (individuals with a gender identity that is not congruent with their sex assigned at birth). SGM communities share a common experience of social marginalization, legal discrimination, political disenfranchisement, and familial rejection. Despite limited data, SGM people are believed to live in nearly all counties in the United States, be a part of other underrepresented minority groups, be in every socioeconomic stratum, and speak the diversity of languages in our nation. To examine this, we recently analyzed all the last three years (2013-2015) of National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) data (manuscript under review) and found that self-identified lesbian, gay, and bisexual people were primarily younger (28% were 18-29 years old, 17% were 30-39, 20% were 40-49, 26% were 50-64, and 9% were 65 years or older). Approximately 14% were of Hispanic ethnicity. Regarding race, 80% were Caucasian, 15% were African/African-American, and 5% were another race. Approximately 30% reported an annual earned income of $0 while 11% reported earning more than $75,000. SGM people are largely invisible in federal population-based efforts because they are not counted. Because sexual orientation and gender identity are not collected during the decennial US Census, the precise number of SGM people in the US as well as their age, geographic, linguistic, race, ethnicity, income, and regional distributions are unknown. Without these data, national population-based studies (e.g., National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, NHANES) are unable to generate sampling frames that adequately account for the disproportionate geographic distribution of SGM people (e.g., San Francisco city census reports that ~15% identify as SGM). In 2010, the NIH commissioned the Institute of Medicine (now National Academy of Medicine) to study SGM health to inform the nation?s SGM health research agenda. In addition to recommending research in nearly all aspects of health, the consensus committee poignantly stated, ?[t]he relative lack of population-based data presents the greatest challenge to describing the health status and health-related needs of LGBT people? and emphasized the need for national research efforts, such as All of Us, to explicitly include data measures or questions about SGM identity. This report and other research led the National Center for Health Statistics to include sexual orientation in the NHIS and the NIH to designate the SGM population as a ?health disparity population for research purposes? in October 2016. SGM people are an underserved and understudied population that is vulnerable to poor health. SGM people experience unique health and healthcare disparities including higher rates of smoking, HIV infection, certain cancers, depression, suicide attempts, and delaying access to health care. Infrequent collection of sexual orientation and gender identity data in clinical settings makes performing SGM-specific studies challenging. Healthcare providers receive inadequate training in caring for SGM patients that often results in mistreatment or discrimination, which deters research participation. While these inequities have been associated with societal stigmatization and minority stress in small studies, difficulties identifying and studying SGM communities severely hinder the identification of health disparity etiologies and the design of appropriate interventions. By meaningfully including and engaging SGM people, the All of Us Research Program has the potential to have a tremendous impact the health and well-being of millions."
"9282584","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Weight loss and maintenance continues to be problematic for individuals who are overweight or obese. It is established that weight loss improves chronic risk factors for metabolic syndrome; however, weight management programs that have been proven efficacious are seldom translated into the health care community. In particular, those who live in rural locations may not have access to the resources available to their urban counterparts. We have a successful weight management program termed University of Kansas Weight Management Program, (KWMP) that has been ongoing since 1986. KWMP is grounded in social cognitive theory and has consistently provided >10 percent weight loss at 6 months in a wide array of individuals. We have recently developed a phone based delivery system for KWMP that eliminates many barriers for providers and participants by substituting group conference calls for face-to-face clinics (GP) and by delivering weight loss materials and products directly to the participant. In this fashion, the health educator and participants can reside in any location and receive the same information that has traditionally been delivered in the clinic. We have also developed and tested a less intensive version of KWMP delivered individually by phone termed IP that involves less contact between health educator and participant but also results in clinically significant weight loss (i.e.,>7 percent). e propose to translate our university based program by training rural health care providers to deliver GP, IP, and an enhanced version of usual care (EUC) for individuals that are overweight and obese. This design will allow us to determine the effectiveness of gradients of care for weight management, including cost effectiveness and improvement in risk factors for metabolic syndrome when delivered by rural health care providers. Overweight and obese adults will be randomly assigned to GP, IP, or EUC for a 24 mo. trial of 6 mos. weight loss, 12 mos. weight maintenance) and 6 mos. no contact follow-up. Specifically, we expect GP to provide significantly greater weight loss than IP, and IP to provide significantly greater weight loss than EUC at 6 months. Secondary aims include weight change at 12, 18 and 24 months, cost effectiveness analysis, changes in chronic disease risk factors (i.e., metabolic syndrome), and associations between adoption of intervention components and magnitude of weight loss and maintenance. Extensive process analysis will document the fidelity of the interventions delivered by rural health care providers, challenges and barriers to effective implementation, and use of program specified activities. Should the phone interventions translate successfully; rural clinics will have one or more new evidence and cost based options to improve weight management for residents of rural areas."
"9403750","Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is a life-threatening disease characterized by hepatic and peripheral insulin resistance, which dysregulate inter-tissue metabolic flux and communication to promote hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia. Insulin signaling throughout the body is mediated by the insulin receptor substrate proteins IRS1 and IRS2. Within the liver, insulin regulates gene expression and metabolism largely via the IRS-dependent inhibition of transcription factor FoxO1. This renewal is founded on the striking observation that hepatic insulin resistance in ?LDKO? mice?which lack Irs1 and Irs2 in liver?propagates insulin resistance to the skeletal muscle and white and brown adipose tissues (WAT and BAT). Excessive hepatic glucose production (HGP) during diabetes owes, at least in part, to hepatic insulin resistance and activation of gluconeogenic genes by FoxO1. However, HGP is normalized in LDKO-mice upon inactivation/deletion of hepatic FoxO1 (i.e., ?LTKO? mice), suggesting that unknown, FoxO1-dependent factors secreted by the liver (?hepatokines?) act to promote insulin resistance in peripheral tissues. This competitive renewal focuses upon the dysregulated hepatokines in LDKO liver to reveal how peripheral metabolic disease depends upon FoxO1?rather than hepatic insulin signaling per se. This is an innovative departure from the study of a single tissue or pathway that can, moreover, reveal the mechanisms by which hepatic resistance alone gives rise to many of the features of T2DM in mice. Robust preliminary data allow us to focus upon functionally important hepatokines that are elevated or decreased in LDKO liver, but normalized in LTKO liver. In addition to increased cardiovascular disease risk, T2DM is associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) that can progress to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and eventual hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); we have further established that this progression is attenuated in LTKO mice. Using deletion of floxed hepatokine alleles?or hepatotropic AAV (adeno-associated virus) to knock-down or over-express hepatokine genes?we employ both LDKO and LTKO mice to reveal (and corroborate) the effects of dysregulated FoxO1-dependent hepatokines upon systemic nutrient homeostasis and the progression of liver disease."
"9312910","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) is a ubiquitous multifunctional RNA-binding protein (RBP) located in the nucleus. The abnormal and pathogenic aggregation of FUS in the cytoplasm of neurons defines subtypes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), termed FTLD-FUS or ALS-FUS. ALS- FUS cases are caused by mutations in the FUS gene. In these cases, the accumulation of FUS is thought to be driven by long-term increases in cytoplasmic FUS caused by mutations that decrease nuclear import through disruption of a conserved nuclear localization signal (NLS). However, it is unknown why FUS accumulates in FTLD-FUS cases. Moreover, it is unclear what causes cytoplasmic FUS in ALS to aggregate and become insoluble. We have discovered a novel mechanism that may explain both phenomena. We find that FUS can be phosphorylated and this event causes the cytoplasmic redistribution of FUS in multiple cells including human astrocytes and neurons. In particular, we find the DNA-damage, caused by chemical toxins, is a potent inducer of FUS phosphorylation. Furthermore, DNA-damage also causes cytoplasmic accumulation of EWS, TAF15, and TRN, which mimics a unique aspect of FTLD-FUS pathology. Preliminary evidence suggests that phosphorylation of FUS leads to increased amounts of FUS in the cytoplasm by disrupting a novel nuclear localization signal in the N-terminus. Consistent with this mechanism, we find that a FUS phospho-mimetic accumulates in the cytoplasm and forms aggregates. These aggregates co-label with markers of stress granules (SGs), RNA/protein granules that have been linked to the formation of inclusions in ALS-FUS and other forms of neurodegeneration. We theorize that cytoplasmic phosphorylated FUS can cause disease through a toxic gain of function by inducing granules that sequester RNA and RNA-binding proteins, impeding normal function. Importantly, we find that phosphorylated FUS occurs in the biochemically insoluble fraction of brains of human and mice with FUS inclusions. Finally, we find a large increase in ?-H2AX, a marker of DNA damage, in FTLD-FUS brains, supporting the idea that DNA damage and phosphorylation of FUS is a key component of disease pathogenesis. In this proposal we focus on the hypothesis that double-strand DNA damage induces phosphorylation of FUS by the DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) causing FUS accumulation in the cytoplasm by impairing nuclear import. We will test this hypothesis by 1) Defining the kinase and types of DNA damage responsible for FUS phosphorylation, 2) Determining how phosphorylation of FUS causes cytoplasmic translocation and affects function, and 3) Determining the role of FUS phosphorylation in neurodegeneration. This research will provide insight into how FUS accumulation causes neurodegeneration and inform drug development strategies for ALS and FTLD. Our data suggest that methods to prevent FUS from forming pathogenic RNA/stress granules, potentially through modulation of the DNA- repair pathway or DNA-PK, may yield treatments for these devastating neurodegenerative diseases."
"9356305","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephritis is a common and serious manifestation of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus for which there is no adequate therapy. Some patients will exhibit a response to current immunosuppressive regimens while others will not; all are at risk for on and off target toxicities. The current proposal is to apply new technologies for high resolution analyses of gene expression and immunophenotype to kidney, blood and urine of lupus patients with active nephritis in order to develop a better understanding of disease pathogenesis and tissue injury, and stratify patients with respect to therapeutic response for more informed clinical decision making. We will explore blood and urine for less invasive surrogate markers for kidney inflammation. Our plan relies of optimization of analytic approaches, informed choice of cellular subpopulations to analyze, followed by two small studies to refine and validate the approach. In the first, we will study kidneys, blood and urine o 20 patients at a time of renal flare in order to dissect patterns of inflammation. In the second we will study cellular subsets in blood of 40 patients who were part of a clinical trial of lupus nephritis to understand changes from baseline profiles of gene expression and function response in those who experienced a full clinical response to therapy and those who failed to respond. Finally, we will use the information from these studies to design a large scale longitudinal study of patients with lupus nephritis. This unbiased re-examination of this unmet medical challenge should identify novel therapeutic targets, inform the generation of new models of disease, and lead to predictors of response that can then be validated in clinical trials We have unique technology resources and a powerful consortium of clinical investigators in the newly established Lupus Nephritis Trials Network that includes: (i) the infrastructure and expertise for clinical study implementation; (ii) protocols and consents for acquisition of blood, urine, and biopsy specimens; and (3) scalability to move from phase 0 and 1 to phase 2 at the appropriate time."

"9197613","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Patients with advanced malignant mesothelioma (MM) have limited treatment options. The standard first-line chemotherapy regimen, pemetrexed/cisplatin, improves survival compared to cisplatin alone from 9 to 12 months. In order to develop mechanism-based therapies for MM, it is important to identify the oncogenic mutations and signaling pathways that drive its development and sustain its maintenance. Although about 75% of MM carry mutations at the NF2 locus, which encodes Merlin. We have discovered that inactivation of Merlin drives the development and maintenance of MM by activating the pro-oncogenic E3 ubiquitin Cullin Ring Ligase CRL4DCAF1, which in turn inhibits the Hippo pathway tumor suppressor kinases Lats1/2. Our Preliminary Studies indicate that the CRL inhibitor MLN4924, developed by Millenium-Takeda, exhibits exhibit selective preclinical efficacy in NF2 mutant MM cells. In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that MLN4924 significantly enhances the efficacy of pemetrexed and cisplatin in NF2 mutant MM. To establish the pre-clinical and clinical activity of MLN4924, alone and in combination with chemotherapy, in NF2 mutant MM, we will pursue the following independent, but interrelated Specific Aims: 1) To test the preclinical activity of MLN4924, alone and in combination with chemotherapy, in a novel Genetically Engineered Mouse Model (GEMM) of MM. Nf2Flox/Flox; LucR mice will be injected in their pleural cavity with lentiviruses encoding Cre in combination with short hairpin (sh) RNAs targeting the mRNAs encoded by Cdkn2a or both Cdkn2a and Bap1. Tumor-bearing mice will be treated with MLN4924, pemetrexed/cisplatinum, or both and subjected to bioluminescent imaging to monitor tumor growth. Molecular studies on tumor samples will enable us to verify target inhibition and to determine the mechanism of action of MLN4924. 2) To test the preclinical efficacy of MLN4924, alone and in combination with chemotherapy, in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of MPM. PDX models of MMs carrying mutations at the NF2 locus, the BAP1 locus, or at both loci will be treated with MLN4924, alone and in combination with cispatin/pemetrexed, and the results will be examined as described above. The sensitivity of prospectively isolated cancer stem cells to the drugs will be examined in tumor organoid cultures. 3) To test the clinical efficacy of MLN4924 by conducting a phase I/II trial in patients with pleural or peritoneal MM. We will conduct a single institution trial comprising two cohorts: 1 a phase II trial of single agent MLN4924 in patients with NF2 mutant MM, and 2) a phase I trial combining MLN4924 with pemetrexed/cisplatin in previously untreated patients. Information gained from pre-clinical studies in the newly developed GEMM model and state-of-the-art PDX models will help to refine the analysis of patient samples from the clinical trial and, conversely, information gained from the clinical trial will motivate additional pre-clinical studies. We envisin that mechanism-based therapies, such as the one proposed here, will radically improve the outcome of patients with MM."
"9525683","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application, a translational component of a U01 Consortium of UMMS, Cleveland Clinic, UTSouthwestern and U Louisville, explores novel therapies and biomarker discoveries in AH. Direct effects of alcohol on hepatocytes, increased intestinal permeability and activation of the innate immune system (Kupffer cells) by gut-derived LPS are major factors in AH leading to over-activation of the pro-inflammatory cascade. Currently, there are no effective strategies in AH. Our data in a mouse model demonstrated that deficiency of IL-1R or inhibition of IL-1R signaling by administration of an IL-receptor antagonist significantly attenuated steatosis and inflammatory cytokine induction in alcoholic liver disease. We also identified that microRNA-155 is an alcohol-induced regulator of increased Kupffer cell activation and TNF production in ALD. Furthermore, increased circulating levels of microRNAs correlated with liver injury and inflammation identifying them as potential biomarkers. The aims of this U01 application are to 1) evaluate novel therapeutic targets to attenuate inflammation in AH using bench-to-bedside approaches, and to 2) identify unique biomarkers for diagnostic and therapeutic decisions in AH. The following Aims will be investigated: Aim #1: To identify and validate novel biomarkers of AH associated with mild-moderate and severe disease and response to therapy by exploring a) circulating microRNAs as markers of mild-moderate and severe AH and/or response to therapy, b) TLR4 tolerance in monocytes as a biomarker of disease severity and/or response to therapy and c) circulating unique biomarkers of systemic inflammation, gut permeability, liver injury and regeneration. Aim #2: To test IL-1 inhibition as a novel therapeutic strategy in alcoholic hepatitis using translational approaches. Aim #3: To identify unique new drug targets for treatment of AH using a translational approach to test Farnesoid X Receptor agonists and miRNA-155 inhibition in preclinical studies."
"9407282","Abstract The CDC estimates that 65-80% of clinically significant drug resistant bacterial infections are drug refractory due to a change in physiological state of pathogens associated with biofilm formation. TRL1068 is a high affinity (100 pM) native human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that disrupts biofilms by extracting a key bacterial scaffolding protein. The epitope is highly conserved in the target protein homologs across a broad spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria, including all ESKAPE pathogens. The released bacteria regain sensitivity to antibiotics. Biofilm disruption has been demonstrated in vitro for Staphylococcus aureus and for several gram negative species: Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae. In vivo, TRL1068 in combination with an antibiotic vs. antibiotic alone has shown statistically significant efficacy against methicillin resistant S. aureus (MRSA) in two animal models (infected implants in mice and infective endocarditis in rats) and against a drug resistant clinical isolate of A. baumannii in a mouse model of soft tissue infection. Clinical toxicity risk is low, as the epitope is not present in the human proteome and the mAb was cloned from a healthy human donor. A successful pre-IND meeting with the FDA has been held and IND-enabling development activities are underway by an experienced team funded in part by a Phase II SBIR grant from NIAID. The major goal of the SBIR funding is to develop a Master Cell Bank (MCB) producing TRL1068 at commercially useful levels along with development of product specific assays. Expression at the pooled CHO cell transfection stage is within the expected range prior to subcloning and optimization of upstream and downstream processing. The remaining SBIR work has low risk of failure and will be completed in Q3 2017. We now seek CRP funding to complete the IND-enabling preclinical development including toxicology studies, additional animal efficacy studies, and manufacturing of sufficient material for Phase 1 and Phase 2 human clinical trials. With CRP funding projected to start shortly after the end of the SBIR Phase II funding, we anticipate IND filing within 30 months after receipt of CRP funding. No SBIR or CRP funding will be used for actual clinical trial expenses."
"9309055","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cystic fibrosis (CF) animal models have contributed significantly to understanding the mechanism of underlying disease. However, existing CF animal models have their limitations, either because the animal models fail to reproduce human phenotypes or because the animal models have very high maintenance costs and need specialized care. In addition, lacking good ?F508CFTR animal model results in poor understanding the pathogenesis of the most common mutation in CF patients and halts CF drug discovery. Using CRISPR/Cas9 we have developed the first rabbit with the disruption of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). Initial work on CFTR knockout rabbits (CFTR-/-) revealed lung pathology that is similar to that in human CF patients. In this application, we will test: Aim 1, generate rabbits carrying ?F508 mutation (CFTR?F508/?F508) in CFTR locus; Aim 2, generate gut-corrected CFTR?F508/?F508 rabbits (TgCFTR-CFTR?F508/?F508); and Aim 3, characterize CFTR?F508/?F508 rabbits. The success of proposed work will provide an animal model for understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms, accelerating CF drug discovery and testing the efficacy of new drugs."
"9523546","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center was founded as a matrix center within the Duke University School of Medicine in 1972 and the Duke Cancer Institute (DCI) was created as a new administrative entity within Duke Medicine in October, 2010, with authority and responsibility for all cancer-related activities at Duke University and in the Duke University Health System. The DCI was started with significant investments from Duke Medicine, including a new $243M clinical care outpatient facility, over $60 million of new funds available to support new initiatives, a formula for ongoing investment by the Duke Health System to support ongoing and new DCI initiatives, and additional laboratory and office-based research space. These new commitments were in addition to the clinical space and administrative and Shared Resource lab space already under DCI control and the many laboratories in the Duke School of Medicine and University housing DCI members. The first DCI Executive Director, Michael Kastan, M.D., Ph.D., was hired in August, 2011, followed by major changes in administrative infrastructure, leadership positions and roles, and Cancer Center committees. CCSG Programs and Shared Resources were re-organized, investments were made in high-priority areas, and mechanisms established to more effectively facilitate communication and collaborations among DCI faculty. The DCI, which currently consists of 354 members from 25 departments within 5 schools at Duke University (Medicine, Nursing, Arts and Sciences, Engineering, and Business), promotes collaborations between faculty and staff involved in cancer care, research, and education within both Duke University and the Duke University Health System. It is organized as 9 multi-disciplinary research programs (2 basic discovery, 1 population science, and 6 translational) whose work is supported by 13 Shared Resources (8 lab-based and 5 supporting translational/ clinical/ population research activities). On average, approximately 6000 new cancer patients are seen each year at Duke University Hospital (DUH); during the previous 5 calendar years, an average of approximately 1900 patients per year were enrolled on therapeutic clinical trials at DUH and partner sites, the vast majority of which were at DUH. Almost two-thirds of the DCI therapeutic clinical trials represent early phase research (pilot, phase I, phase II). DCI members are supported by over $242M of external cancer- related grant support, $160M of which is peer-reviewed. DCI grant support includes 51 multi-investigator projects and 91 training and fellowship awards. DCI members published over 8000 papers in peer-reviewed journals during the past funding period, ~39% of which represent collaborative efforts between DCI investigators (12% intra-program, 21% inter-program, and 6% both). The DCI will continue to utilize effective oversight and strategic planning to integrate all cancer-related activities in it purview, from basic research to translational studies to clinical and population investigation to patient care to community outreach to regional/national strategies to global cancer."
"9372404","ABSTRACT It is known that the ?-cell of the islet of Langerhans secretes SST, which inhibits the secretion of the glucoregulatory hormones insulin and glucagon and thus impacts glucose metabolism. In spite of SST being a powerful neurotransmitter and immune-modulator that mediates several physiological functions in different tissues, no other roles have been attributed to the islet ?-cell other than to suppress the secretory capacity of its neighboring ?- and ?-cells. Besides, relatively little is known about the mechanisms that regulate SST secretion in the islet. Our long-term goal is to understand the contribution of the ?-cell to islet biology in health and diabetes. In particular, through this project we will determine what regulates ?-cell activity and novel crucial roles for this cell in the islet. We hypothesize the ?-cell is a signaling hub where endocrine, paracrine and neural signals converge and are integrated to set the level of SST secretion, which is a key element for islet homeostasis. We will text the strength of this hypothesis for both, mouse and human islets. Based on preliminary results, we propose that SST secretion from ?-cells plays a dual role: (1) by providing negative feedback to ?- and ?-cells it prevents runaway secretory responses, thus stabilizes hormonal and other co- secreted molecules output, and (2) it modulates intra-islet immune cell infiltration and activation. Therefore, in this project we will pursue two specific aims: (1) to determine the mechanisms involved in the regulation of ?- cell function and SST secretion, and (2) to determine the role of the ?-cell and SST in islet inflammation and diabetes pathogenesis. We will use a combination of novel in vitro (isolated islets), ex vivo (pancreatic tissue slices), and in vivo (intraocular islet grafts) approaches together with pharmacological tools, optogenetic stimulation, cell ablation, functional imaging and systemic metabolic readouts to study how ?-cells are activated and how they influence surrounding endocrine and immune cells. We expect our studies to further our understanding of the circumstances under which the ?-cell is recruited to influence endocrine and immune cells in the islet. We anticipate potential differences in the regulation and roles of ?-cells and SST for islets in mouse and human. If SST's role as an immunomodulator is validated, it is likely that ?-cell will be reconsidered as a key element in the natural history of diabetes. Therefore important advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis of diabetes could be expected."
"9319774","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the first competitive renewal of the interdisciplinary pre-doctoral training program in Stem Cell Biology at the University of Minnesota.

"9484501","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Signaling cascades direct information. Specific and strict temporal and spatial control is essential for the fidelity of this process, as derailed signling cascades lead to disease. Here, we investigate the control of signaling cascades in neurons. If neuronal signaling goes awry, the most prominent results are disease, such as Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome. In this proposal, we specifically focus on the role of protein ser/thr phosphatases (PSPs) in the regulation of these signaling cascades, a histrionically understudied group of proteins that control essential biological functions. In particular, we focus on Calcineurin (CN) and Protein Phosphatase 1 (PP1), which together are responsible for dephosphorylating, with high fidelity and accuracy, more than 50% of all ser/thr residues in humans. Nevertheless, a detailed molecular understanding of how this fidelity and accuracy is achieved is largely missing. This is due, in part, to the fact that this group of proteins is exceedingly difficult to work with, which has frustrated the research community for the last 25 years. The combined laboratories that are part of this application have made significant progress in understanding the structural basis of PSP function and regulation by unraveling novel mechanisms for substrate specificity and signaling pathway fidelity. Our aims are: (1) to gain fundamental, molecular insights into CN substrate recognition, which, compared to our knowledge of substrate recognition by kinases, lags decades behind; (2) to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which CN is potently regulated by RCAN1, a trisomy 21 protein that leads to dysregulation of NFAT signaling and hyper-phosphorylation of tau, leading to Down syndrome and Alzheimer's disease, respectively; and (3) to establish how PP1 regulates translation initiation, setting the stage for the identification of novel routes for treating proten misfolding diseases such as Alzheimer's.  As demonstrated over the last 10 years, we use our PSP: protein holoenzyme structures to develop function models, which are then tested in vivo in cells and neurons in collaboration with the Nairn Laboratory at Yale University, the Cyert Laboratory at Stanford University and the Shenolikar Laboratory at Duke-NUS. Thus, we integrate our structural and functional studies in order to obtain the comprehensive understanding necessary to fully explain the underlying biology of PSPs, ultimately identifying novel routes for the treatment of a variety of neurological disorders. Overall, this proposal rests on an outstanding foundation of: (1) 30 years of functional data that is waiting for a molecular interpretation to provide a deeper understanding and analysis of these critical PSP holoenzymes, (2) specific, highly technical skill sets for working with PP1 and CN, (3) strong preliminary results, including the first PSP: substrate model and (4) an outstanding assembled team that has successfully collaborated for more than 10 years to elucidate the molecular basis of PSP regulation. Therefore, the proposed structural and functional studies will provide a detailed understanding of the roles of CN and PP1 in the brain and will enable us to selectively modulate these particular signaling cascades for medical benefit."
"9308954","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant)        This application is to renew the T32 ES09250-25 training grant entitled, Environmental Carcinogenesis and Mutagenesis (ECM) which has been under the direction of Dr. Stambrook since its inception in 1986. Dr. Alvaro Puga has been a mentor in the Program since early in its history and has served as Associate Director for the past five-year budget period, a role in which he will continue. The focus of the ECM training program initially was exclusively on environmental carcinogenesis and mutagenesis as its title implied. Since that time, the Program has evolved scientifically and conceptually. It also grew from its modest beginnings to its current optimal size when the NIEHS directed that it be merged with a smaller training program in toxicology. By this merger, the Program became more diverse which has proven to be extremely valuable to the trainees. The investigators have, therefore, made every effort to retain this diversity of disciplines to enhance cross-fertilization of ideas and techniques between the trainees. Thus, the trainees are able to cogently discuss the impact of environmental exposures in terms of genetics and toxicology and ultimately in the context of human disease, including cancer. One of the emphases of the ECM Training Program is to train the fellows to appreciate the mechanistic relationships between environmental challenges and their toxicological and carcinogenic outcomes. The consequence of this strategy has been a robust cross-fertilization of ideas and approaches. To preserve this wide range of disciplines, the Program maintains a participating faculty who derive from seven different departments. Thus, the ECM continues to build on its past successes, with graduates in academic, regulatory and industry leadership positions and it continues to fulfill a national need to train individuals in the impact of environmental exposure relating to biological, oncological and toxicological endpoints and human disease. Since its inception, the Program has emphasized recruitment of under-represented minorities, and has been successful in this endeavor. Institutionally, the Program brings together the research efforts of several laboratories to provide a common focus on exposure and environmental health, and facilitates collaborations between these laboratories. The ECM encourages trainees to engage in research that combines the expertise of several laboratories. These interactions are facilitated by biweekly journal club meetings where trainees alternatively present a topical paper or present their data. Pre-doctoral trainees all have the equivalent of an undergraduate major in a chemical, biological or physical science with superior academic achievements. Many have won awards and recognition while in the Program. Postdoctoral candidates are selected based on proven academic accomplishments and hold the degrees of Ph.D., D.V.M. or M.D., and like pre-doctoral trainees are selected from a national pool of applicants. This renewal application requests pre-doctoral (8) and postdoctoral (4) positions, a size that the investigators find optimal for the mission and goals of this Program."
"9329433","7. PROJECT SUMMARY/ ABSTRACT Dry eye syndrome is a common affliction of the eye that affects millions of people. Dry eye is brought on by aging, eye surgery or environmental exposure and is also an adverse effect of contact lens wear, and topical eye medications. Symptoms include pain, burning, itching, redness, sensitivity to light and other discomfort. If left untreated, severe cases may result in vision loss due to corneal scarring. New research from this research team, recently published in the NIH-supported journal PLOS ONE, suggests a new approach to treating dry eye. Using an experimental mouse model, the researchers found that the natural tear protein known as clusterin selectively binds to the ocular surface barrier disrupted by desiccating stress in an all-or-none manner, while also preventing further damage. Known properties of clusterin suggest it may further protect against the upstream effects of inflammatory cascade activation and subsequent squamous metaplasia. The proposed research will investigate this previously unrecognized, endogenous protective mechanism. The planned studies make use of the mouse experimental model and a quantitative functional assay for ocular surface barrier disruption, and take advantage of mouse genetics. The specific aims are: 1) to determine the molecular nature of clusterin intercalation into the ocular surface glycocalyx, and how it might relate to the all- or-none effect; 2) to document the role of clusterin in anti-proteolysis, the effects of proteolysis on the capacity for clusterin binding, and the relationship between the proteolytic and clusterin pathways; 3) to define the endogenous clusterin protection pathway and its role in maintaining an anti-inflammatory environment at the ocular surface. The impact of this research will be new basic science knowledge about the ocular surface barrier, how it is altered in disease, and mechanisms of protection by clusterin. The results will set the stage for clinical innovation."
"9293512","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT This randomized, controlled trial seeks to determine the effectiveness of two common medications for the treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids. Uterine fibroids are benign tumors of the uterus that affect 30% of women during their reproductive years. These tumors are the leading cause of heavy menstrual bleeding and the most common reason for hysterectomy; nearly 200,000 hysterectomies are performed for fibroids in the U.S. every year. Women with fibroids are not traditionally included in randomized medical therapy trials for heavy menstrual bleeding. This study will compare the levonorgestrel intrauterine system to tranexamic acid, an oral medication taken only during menses. Both treatments offer non-estrogen containing medications to reduce risk in women over 35. The results of this work will be clinically significant to providing evidence for decision making and options other than hysterectomy. Our proposal is innovative in that it will extend these medicines to women with fibroids and explore the type of fibroids for which these medications are effective. The following specific aims will be pursued over the next two years: Aim 1 is designed to compare the effectiveness of levonorgestrel intrauterine system to tranexamic acid for heavy menstrual bleeding in women with uterine fibroids using patient reported satisfaction outcomes and duration of use; Aim 2 is designed to determine the patient and fibroid characteristics associated with success of these medications. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) report in 2007 on uterine fibroids recommend that ?high priority should be given to performing randomized trials of the effectiveness of commonly used medical treatments compared with placebo and with each other for the treatment of specific symptoms.? This proposal will meet this gap in knowledge and provide further options for women with uterine fibroids."

"9319888","ABSTRACT ? Virology Core (Core 2, Leader: Dr. Ann Chahroudi, Emory University) Achieving the proposed Program's goal requires precise quantitation and characterization of SHIV reservoirs and viral dynamics. The Virology Core's objective is to support the Program's two Projects in the rigorous testing of their central hypotheses by providing state-of-the-art virological tools including (i) quantitative PCR analyses of cell-associated SHIV DNA and RNA and plasma SHIV RNA, (ii) combined cell culture and PCR- based assays quantifying the proportion of replication-competent viruses, and (iii) viral sequence analyses by deep sequencing and single genome analysis (SGA). The Virology Core will be led by Dr. Chahroudi, with both routine and novel assays performed in her laboratory at Emory University, and in collaboration with Duke sequencing expertise to provide standardized techniques across Projects 1 & 2 that will permit the ascertainment of interpretable and generalizable results. The Core proposes the following Specific Aims: 1) Quantitative PCR analysis of viral loads in plasma and cells. 2) Estimation of the reservoir size by quantification of replication-competent / inducible virus; and 3) Sequence analyses of pre-ART and rebound viremia in comparison to cell-associated SHIV variants during ART and at rebound. These Aims will make use SIV/SHIV quantification assays developed by Dr. Chahroudi's laboratory and rigorously evaluated for sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility in the animal model to be used, as well as SIV/HIV sequencing expertise of the Duke Human Vaccine Institute. The Virology Core will serve both Projects and interact with both the Administrative and Statistical Core and the Nonhuman Primate Core of this Program to achieve our shared goals. The Virology Core is thus strongly positioned to generate reliable and quantifiable data to rigorously assess the origin, predictors, and virologic correlates of viral rebound in this Program."
"9298662","?    DESCRIPTION:  There is a critical need for improved in vitro human toxicology testing to screen and identify potential toxic compounds, the levels at which they are lethal, and evaluate their developmental toxicity on human neural stem cells (NSCs) at the cellular and molecular levels. In particular, understanding mechanisms underlying human toxicity and the role of compounds including environmental toxicants and drug candidates is one of major goals of federal agencies such as NIEHS, NIGMS, and EPA, and has important implications in human health and disease prevention. Although animal models and primary human cells have been extensively used for such toxicology studies, their use is limited by high species variability with little or no predictability of relevance to humans, the instability of primary cells, and insufficient supply of human primary cells including NSCs for high-throughput screening. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop in vitro strategies to rapidly assess compound-induced toxicity, and accurately predict adverse responses in vivo. Using three-dimensional (3D) cultured, human NSCs, together with high-throughput methodology and high-content imaging (HCI), we propose to decipher the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of toxic model compounds. The core hypotheses are: (i) miniaturized 3D NSC microarrays can maintain high neuronal cell functions by better mimicking in vivo microenvironments; (ii) blocking ion channels and transporters on NSCs can modulate cell differentiation and cytotoxicity; (iii) physiological in vivo effects of compounds and their mechanistic actions on NSCs could be replicated and elucidated in vitro via high-throughput, high- content cell function analysis; and (iv) such miniaturized 3D cell culture systems can be used to facilitate mechanistic toxicology assays, which in turn can improve predictability of toxicity in vivo. The specific aims of the proposed work are to (1) demonstrate high neuronal cell functions on 3D NSC microarrays within biomimetic microenvironments in high throughput on the chip, (2) investigate mechanistic actions of various classes of compounds on NSC microarrays using high-throughput, ion channel and transporter assays, and (3) establish HCI assays on 3D NSC microarrays to investigate mechanistic profiles of toxicity by compounds and their metabolites. This information is essential to better understand the mechanistic basis of pharmaceutical toxicology on embryonic and adult human cells and tissues, and prioritize environmental toxicants based on their potential adverse effects on humans."
"9356599","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Given modern globalization, there is a fundamental gap in understanding how to combat the negative impact of US cable TV programs and advertising on the eating habits of youth and families in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC) like Jamaica, especially for those who adopt a part-American identity through a remote accul- turation process. Persistence of this gap represents an important problem because, until it is filled, the effec- tiveness of nutrition interventions designed to combat obesity and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) for populations in and from LMICs will be limited. The long-term goal is to implement effective health promotion and NCD prevention programs and policies, which address Americanization, for LMIC youth and families. The current objective is to use Jamaica as a case study to 1) evaluate a school-based food-focused media literacy intervention which specifically targets US media within the local media landscape; and 2) cement key partner- ships to translate these research findings into national and regional practice and policy. The central hypothesis is that this intervention will help protect Jamaican adolescents and their mothers against harmful media food messages by significantly increasing media literacy and improving intentions and behaviors regarding healthy and unhealthy eating. This hypothesis has been formulated based on applicants? preliminary data from Ja- maica. The rationale for the proposed research is that successful completion would provide, as a model for other LMIC contexts, an evidence-based NCD prevention program to be leveraged across Jamaican schools, and a critical partnership among stakeholders to ensure sustainability of efforts. Guided by strong published (US) and preliminary (Jamaica) data, this hypothesis will be tested by pursuing two specific aims: 1) Conduct a randomized control trial in Jamaica to evaluate a face-to-face food-focused media literacy workshop with sup- plementary SMS/text messages among 90 adolescent-mother dyads; and 2) Facilitate the formation of a Healthy Families partnership that will incorporate media literacy addressing US cable TV programs/advertising into existing school-based policy and intervention efforts. Under the first aim, a brief evidence-based, school- based media literacy curriculum shown to be efficacious for US youth in the applicants? published research will be condensed into a workshop delivered to adolescent-mother dyads recruited from the applicants? long-stand- ing partner schools in Jamaica. Some dyads will also receive SMS messages reinforcing workshop themes, and others will receive no intervention. Under the second aim, the CDC partnership evaluation plan will be used to identify and convene key stakeholders to engage in a series of partnership-building meetings. The ap- proach is innovative because the remote acculturation framework allows the application of a US media literacy intervention to Americanizing LMIC youth and families in a theory-driven manner. The proposed research is significant because it has potential to make a substantial positive contribution to reducing the risk for obesity and NCDs in Jamaica and LMICs and among US immigrants from LMIC regions in a cost-effective manner."
"9526652","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Transplantation holds the promise of reversing the clinical course of millions of Americans afflicted with end- stage organ failure, including a number of gastro-intestinal (GI) diseases. However, a number of issues limit broader access to transplantation and various complications related to the need for lifetime immunosuppression affect the long-term success of transplantation. Thus, the long-term objective of the Transplant Surgery Scientist Training Program (TSSTP) is to foster and support inter-dependent transplant research in order improve outcomes for patients in need of transplantation. We will leverage scientific advances in the life sciences across academic disciplines, and focus these on advancing transplantation, directly and indirectly improving the health of patients in need of GI organs, consistent with the mission of NIDDK. We will train the next generation of postdoctoral scientists (PhDs) and clinician scientists (MDs) in surgery and GI medicine who will advance the field of transplantation, preferably as team scientists. The specific aims of the TSSTP are 1) to educate trainees about the nature of existing barriers both to higher access to, and lower complications from transplantation, and 2) to arm them with a deep knowledge of state-of- the art tools, methodologies, and scientific approaches that can potentially be used to overcome these barriers. Significant `cross-talk' exists in clinical transplantation, thus, we will apply a training program that utilizes the Modular Approach to Transplant Research by Inter-disciplinary eXperts (MATRIX), a model that espouses the concept of inter-dependent team science and research between disciplines. This training model will be deployed across 2 separate training tracks that include 1) basic and translational scientific research within the Northwestern University Collaborative for Transplant Research in Immunobiology and Biomedical Engineering (NUCTRIBE), and 2) health sciences and outcomes research within the Northwestern University Transplant Outcomes Research Collaborative (NUTORC), and implement these in our second funding cycle. A total of 3 trainees will benefit for 2 years each from a customized MATRIX that will incorporate multidisciplinary co- mentoring. Each project must have a direct link to transplantation surgery, and the anchoring discipline in each MATRIX is a transplant clinician. The tactical objectives of this T32 are to: 1) provide stipend support for trainees; 2) provide multi-level, inter-disciplinary mentorship bringing together transplant clinician-scientists and non-clinician-scientists with state-of-the research methodologists; 3) protect trainees from clinical activities that compete for their time; 4) sustain an administrative structure that enhances both the quality and diversity of the candidate pool and trainees; 5) provide training opportunities that span the spectrum from both basic/translational science (NUCTRIBE) to clinical/health services and outcomes research (NUTORC) at their intersection with clinical transplantation; and 6) continue an ongoing evaluation process for determining whether or not the program is meeting its goals and objectives."
"9316354","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The overall goal of the HMS LINCS Center is to delineate the fundamental principles of cellular response to perturbagens at the level of single-cells and cell populations and to make response data routinely available via web-based browse, query and programmatic interfaces. This will involve the development and testing of new measurement methods, computational algorithms, and response signatures for diverse human cell types exposed to perturbations individually and in combination. We will emphasize the systematic collection of data not currently available in existing public databases including live and fixed-cell imaging, biochemical data on signaling proteins and multi-factorial drug-response phenotypes. A focus on diverse transformed and primary cells, including those derived from healthy and diseased donors, and on clinical grade small molecules (kinase inhibitors and epigenome drugs) will increase the translational impact of our work. The proposed LINCS Center represents a continuation of a program in operation for ~3.5 years under a LINCS pilot phase U54 award. We will expand the scope and sophistication of our Center, devoting  significant effort to (i) improving the quality of data analysis and visualization, particularly wih respect to the  complexities of perturbagen polypharmacy (ii) accelerating the release of perturbagen-response signatures  using methods that have been demonstrated to yield reliable and informative data, with a particular  emphasis on primary and non-transformed cells (iii) developing and applying new measurement methods,  particularly mass spectrometry for analysis of cell populations and live-cell imaging for analysis of single cells.  The work will involve nine complementary but independent aims. In Data Generation, Aim 1 will perform systematic analysis of perturbagen responses at a single-cell level. Aim 2 will collect multiplex protein and mRNA data on perturbagen response using a set of complementary imaging, mass spectrometry and bead-based assays. Aim 3 will apply LINCS methods to non-transformed immune cells and induced pluripotent stem cells, and explore if signatures can guide a detailed medicinal chemistry campaign. In Data Analysis, Aim 4 will construct perturbagen-response signatures using statistical modeling, network inference and machine learning methods. Aim 5 will develop new approaches to understanding and analyzing drug interactions on multiple phenotypes in single cells. Aim 6 will develop a novel compressed sensing framework for analyzing the poly-pharmacology of kinase inhibitors. Aim 7 will enhance the query, browse and explore functions of the HMS LINCS website and database and its integration with the UCSC Genome Browser. In Community Interaction and Outreach, Aim 8 will implement diverse training and outreach activities, including collaboration with LINCS and non-LINCS research groups. In Administration, Aim 9 will ensure effective management of the Center, sustained access to tools and data produced within the LINCS Project, and compliance with program goals."
"9360100","Abstract The twin study design in brain imaging offers a very effective way of determining heritability of the human brain. The difference in variability between monozygotic (MZ) and same-sex dizygotic (DZ) twins can be used in determining heritability. We propose to determine the extent of heritability of both structural and functional brain networks at the voxel-level using 200 pairs of twin (400 individuals) of fMRI/DTI and MRI. To obtain high- resolution heritability map of the brain networks, the project requires taking more than 25 thousands voxels for fMRI and 1.2million voxels for MRI/DTI as network nodes, which is a serious computational challenge. The project proposes many new algorithms for constructing large-scale brain networks and subsequently mapping the heritability of the networks. This study will provide the brain imaging community with the baseline brain network heritability maps as well as a versatile open-source toolbox of algorithms for modeling and visualizing large-scale brain networks of three different imaging modalities."
"9312675","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Teen dating violence (TDV) is serious public health issue that disproportionately impacts African American youth and their families. TDV is associated with negative health outcomes, high-risk behaviors, and future intimate partner violence. The purpose of our project, Shaping the Message, is to reduce TDV among African American youth using community based participatory research (CBPR) methods. Prevention efforts that focus on reducing societal risk factors, such as TDV supportive social norms, are needed to enhance current prevention efforts targeting individual risk factors. Social norms often play a critical role in maintaining individual, relationship, and community risk factors. This projct seeks to identify core intervention elements necessary to integrate two evidence- supported approaches-youth and family engagement and media literacy--in order to change TDV supportive social norms. A public university, a private historically black college (HBCU), and a community organization will enhance an existing partnership and build upon successful past research collaborations and TDV prevention activities. In addition, all partners are experienced in effectively facilitating group process, managing conflict, and bringing all voices into the discussion. This project will focus on youth and families who live in the Beattie's Ford Road Corridor, a predominately African American community with significant challenges and strengths. The partnership will engage community members and recruit advisory board members through a series of community meetings. We will use multiple community forums to provide TDV health education, promote dialog, and gather feedback over three years. We will also provide a two-part CBPR workshop for all prospective Advisory Board members. The Advisory Board will be made up of community members, research and content experts, and youth. They will guide partnership activities, including data design, collection, analysis, and dissemination in accordance with CBPR principles. Board members will meet quarterly and commit to a three-year term of service. During Year 2, we plan to collect preliminary data based on research questions developed by our advisory board. Preliminary data will be disseminated locally, regionally, and nationally through conferences, papers, and project newsletters. In Year 3, findings will be used to create an articulated research agenda that includes future CBPR projects and funding proposals. The partnership will also execute an MOU to ensure that collaborative efforts are sustained."
"9322503","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of this proposal is to develop an effective magnetic resonance (MR) probe for noninvasive, molecular imaging of renal fibrosis. Renal fibrosis is a hallmark of all chronic kidney diseases (CKD). It is estimated that 500 million peopl worldwide are currently suffering from CKD and many of these patients will progress to end- stage renal disease (ESRD), a devastating disorder that requires dialysis or kidney transplantation. The incidence of ESRD has doubled over the last 25 years in the United States, and in fact, treatment of CKD and ESRD accounted for 27% ($60 billion) of Medicare expenses in 2005. Clinical studies have demonstrated a strong correlation between ESRD and the extent of renal fibrosis. Quantification of renal fibrosis should predict long-term outcome of renal function in CKD patients and could also be used to monitor response to new anti- fibrotic therapies. Currently, biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing renal fibrosis. However, biopsy is not suitable for monitoring disease progression in CKD patients as it is invasive and subject to sampling error. Therefore, there is a major unmet medical need to develop noninvasive strategies to detect and monitor progression of renal fibrosis.  This proposal is in response to RFA-DK-13-026, Novel Methods for Detection and Measurement of Organ Fibrosis in Kidney, Bone Marrow, and Urological Diseases. In particular it responds to the specific need for Novel minimally invasive imaging methods for the detection and measurement of organ fibrosis and to detect changes in fibrosis that quantify progression, stabilization, and/or regression over time and to Correlate fibrotic status with organ dysfunction, recovery, and/or regression Renal function progressively declines in response to the excessive accumulation of extracellular matrix proteins. Myofibroblasts secrete collagens, as well as the enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX) which crosslinks the collagen fibrils. Recently, we have developed a prototype small molecule magnetic resonance (MR) probe, termed Gd-Hyd, with specificity to cross-linked collagen. In preliminary data we have demonstrated that Gd- Hyd can accurately detect renal, liver and pulmonary fibrosis in small animal models. Since LOX-mediated crosslinking of collagen is an aspect of active disease, our hypothesis is that molecular imaging of LOX-mediated collagen crosslinking accurately reflects renal fibrogenesis and thus can be used to detect renal fibrosis and monitor disease progression and response to therapy.  The importance of these studies cannot be overstated as CKD is a major worldwide health problem. The accomplishment of our Specific Aims would lead to a new methodology for identifying fibrotic patients at high- risk for disease progression and poor survival and also for monitoring response to anti-fibrotic therapies."

"9312884","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Synuclein aggregation in dopaminergic neurons is a hallmark of Parkinson's disease (PD) pathology. The most common genetic risk factor for PD is glucocerebrosidase (GBA) mutation with as many as 7% of PD patients carrying this mutation. Work to date has primarily focused on the loss of GBA enzymatic activity that could contribute to ?-synuclein accumulation and/or aggregation. However, evidence has indicated that improperly folded mutant GBA could also contribute to the ?-synuclein aggregation independent of the loss of enzymatic activity. Our central hypothesis is that mutant GBA is mistargeted from lysosomes to the cytosol, which interferes with ?-synuclein degradation by chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA). We will test this hypothesis with a combination of biochemical, cell biological, mouse genetics, and neuropath logical techniques in several systems including isolated lysosomes, mouse models, post-mortem human brain, and fibroblasts from patients' skin biopsy. Our research strategies are divided into three specific aims: Aim 1 will investigate the mechanism by which mutant GBA attenuates CMA and leads to ?-synuclein accumulation by examining each step of CMA in an in vitro system using isolated lysosomes, purified mutant GBA and ?- synuclein proteins. Aim 2 will study whether CMA alteration occurs in GBA-mutant mouse models by using a novel CMA reporter in neuronal cultures and determine whether the protein levels of CMA machinery components change in GBA-mutant mouse models and post-mortem PD brain with GBA mutations. Aim 3 will determine CMA activity using the reporter in the skin fibroblasts from PD patients with GBA mutations, PD patients without GBA mutations, and age-matched controls. These data will provide evidence on whether mutant GBA causes CMA dysfunction, leading to ?-synuclein aggregation, and whether CMA dysfunction is a typical feature of PD. The proposed study could contribute to the future identification of mechanism-based biomarker and therapeutic targets. This K08 proposal also outlines a detailed 5-year training program with specific formal coursework and structured mentoring for the candidate, Sheng-Han Kuo, M.D. The proposed work will be carried out in the Department of Neurology at Columbia University, an excellent environment for training physician-scientists. He will receive the necessary training under the mentorship of Drs. David Sulzer, Ana Maria Cuervo, and Karen Marder, world-renowned investigators in the PD field and acquire necessary skill set to become an independent researcher. The long-term goal of the candidate is to be a translational physician-scientist to investigate the mechanism underlying PD pathology and to develop clinical applicable biomarkers for PD."
"9357513","Summary: Demonstration Project Our proposed Demonstration Project (DP) serves to provide meaningful evidence for the feasibility and utility of our CART system to move to Phase II CART research. The DP is designed as a feasibility study of the technology system, while also assessing the DP as a primary Aging in Place (AiP) research study, testing whether the CART system measures and detects maintenance of independence and/or functional declines and transitions leading to greater dependency. Our DP hypothesis is that the AiP metrics derived from the technologies employed in our DP are capable of measuring and predicting loss of independence or its risk profile. The CART DP is based on the existing ORCATECH platform that was specifically designed to facilitate AiP research in real world community settings. The iterative CART system will be developed using well- established processes of the systems development life cycle and user-centered design, applied across four cohorts representing 360 AiP residents who are particularly challenged to remain independent. These include the oldest old with chronic disease, veterans living in rural communities, minorities (African American and Hispanic) and socially isolated seniors of low income. With these considerations in mind, our aims are to:  1. Establish the basic CART platform and research infrastructure, ?CART V1.0?. This will entail  design and analysis of the optimal system for initial deployment starting with the basic ORCATECH  platform and focusing on the challenges that may be faced in implementing technology-related  research functionality in older populations most challenged to maintain independence.  2. Prepare and deploy the CART V1.0 system to our four CART sites. This aim focuses on preparing  the CART sites and technology (training, setting up the technologies in homes, establishing optimized  use by the research participants and research teams, etc.). The sites, chosen for their research  expertise and diverse cohorts, are readily available for AiP research and will test this initial system  leading to a second major phase of development of CART V2.0.  3. Iteratively, optimize and add needed functionality to the system in subsequent versions of the  platform to result in a final CART V2.0 for the Demonstration Project. This includes improving our  capacity to identify unique behaviors of individuals in a dyad, assessing out of home activity, and  developing an instrument to proactively assess scalability, the Scalability of Technology in Aging  Research Tool (?START?).  4. Deploy and test the full CART V2.0 system in the Demonstration Project in year four. This aim is  geared towards testing the hypothesis that the AiP metrics derived from the technologies employed are  capable of measuring and predicting loss of independence or its risk profile."
"9516052","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Translational Research and Evolving Alcoholic-hepatitis Treatment (TREAT) consortium was established in response to the RFA-AA-12-007. This consortium comprises of Indiana University (IU), Mayo Clinic (MC) and the Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU). The main objective of TREAT consortium is to perform patient oriented research in close collaboration with basic scientists in alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and expedite the translation of emerging findings.  The three overarching aims of TREAT consortium are: (1) to perform a prospective, multicenter observational study leading to a well characterized registry and bio-sample repository together with newer insights into the natural history of AH~ (2) to perform three phase 2a proof of concept trials with three novel agents targeting putative mechanisms of AH, and (3) to better understand the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of human AH and predictors of response to therapy utilizing samples collected under specific aims 1 and 2. All centers will contribute for specific aim 1.  The TREAT-VCU will focus on the role of gut integrity, endotoxemia, gut microbiota, metabolomics and role of eicosanoids specifically lipoxygenases. Specific aim 2 proposes a phase 2a proof of concept placebo- controlled, dose-ranging study of Imm 124-E (bovine colostrum enriched with IgG anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) in subjects with severe AH. Subjects with severe AH will receive standard of care and steroids when indicated. The subjects when starting steroids will be randomized to receive the study drug or placebo. The subjects will be monitored to treatment success and failure, safety, tolerability and efficacy of the study drug.   The specific aim 3 of TREAT-VCU is to define the role of systemic activation of lipoxygenases (LOX) as a driver of the severity of AH. We will test the hypothesis that intestinal microbiome-derived metabolites activate circulating macrophages to produce pro-inflammatory LOX that activate pathways that drive the phenotype of severe AH. We will perform detailed characterization of the microbiome-metagenome and the systemic eicosanoid profile and further establish their relationship to the hepatic transcriptome using a systems biology approach in subjects with severe AH, mild AH, heavy drinkers without AH and matched non-alcoholic controls.  The proposed studies are expected to demonstrate new insights into the natural history of AH, novel therapies as proof of concept and identify newer targets for intervention and drug development moving closer to the goal of accelerating the translation of newer findings in direct alignment with the priorities of NIAAA."

"9388140","Project Summary SLE is a chronic autoimmune syndrome that can involve a variety of organ systems and frequently affects young individuals. It has been suggested that uncontrolled oxidative stress in the cells of SLE patients contributes to functional oxidative modifications of many proteins, lipids, and DNA, consequently triggering autoimmunity. However, the role RNA oxidation plays in the development of autoimmune diseases such as SLE is not known. Under both normal and oxidative stress conditions, RNA oxidation levels are much higher than DNA oxidation levels; however, available information on the potential effects of RNA oxidation is scarce. A major reason for the shortage of work on RNA oxidation is the misconception that normal RNA turnover should diminish effects of oxidized RNA on cell metabolism and gene expression. However, since oxidation of nucleic acids occurs in just a few minutes, and ribosomal and non-coding RNAs live in the cell for days, there is ample opportunity for oxidized RNA to have deleterious and long-standing effects. Our scientific premise is that spatial separation of RNA in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and mitochondria ensures that some RNAs will be more exposed to oxidation than others by restricting accessibility to oxidants. We propose in Aim 1 that MAVS-mediated hyperpolarization of mitochondria will stall some of the RNAs at their surface and promote their oxidation. We propose that non- coding ribosomal RNA, like 5S RNA, is greatly affected. In Aim 2, based on the fact that 5S RNA binds to its own transcription factor, we propose that RNA oxidation will lead to changes in 5S RNA gene expression, and also to a decrease in copy number variation of ribosomal genes. Data obtained in this application will provide the grounds for our upcoming R01 application investigating the novel premise that autoimmune diseases such as SLE can be associated with a disrupted ribosomal DNA copy number in the genome as a result of environmental exposure."
"9397823","Abstract: Anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction surgery results in protracted quadriceps weakness that is associated with altered biomechanics and heightened risk of subsequent injuries. Little progress has been made in improving quadriceps strength in the past 15-20 years. Alterations in the morphological and cellular composition of the vastus lateralis muscle promote muscle weakness following an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction. These features are not responsive to traditional physical therapy techniques. A promising emerging treatment, blood flow restriction training (BFRT) has been shown to address these same alterations in healthy subjects; however, it has never been tested in those with an injury. Pilot data in the current proposal shows that BFRT can lead to a significant increase in muscle strength following an anterior cruciate ligament injury. This project seeks to mechanistically determine the ability of BFRT to address underlying muscle cellular deficits following anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared to usual care. Goals in the current proposal are as follows: aim 1 will determine if BFRT is able to significantly improve knee mechanics and quadriceps strength following an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction compared to usual care. Aim 2 will use advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques to assess improvements in quadriceps morphology after training with BFRT. Lastly, aim 3 will identify BFRT-mediated improvements in cellular deficits in the quadriceps as the result of BFRT training versus usual care. The expected outcomes will show for the first time that BFRT is an effective mechanistic treatment for normalizing quadriceps strength within individuals following an anterior cruciate ligament reconstruction."

Among the services that have been provided are: mouse phenotyping, comprehensive slide evaluation and interpretation, consultation, autopsy training, and photomicroscopy. Additional services utilize the Core's histology laboratory to provide histopathology slide preparation, as well as special histochemical and immunohistochemical staining. Working with the Facility Director, Dr. Durham, is Dr. Elizabeth Buza, who is the Core's Technical Director and lead pathologist. Dr. Buza has expertise in mouse pathology and additional training in mouse models of disease from Novartis and Jackson Labs, and she has worked with Dr. Durham for several years. There are several board-certified anatomic pathologists who support Drs. Durham and Buza, and are available to provide specialty expertise depending on the investigator's particular needs. They include Dr. Julie Engiles (osteopathology), Dr. Elizabeth Mauldin (dermatopathology), and Dr. Melissa Sánchez (oral pathology and immunohistochemistry). The Core currently serves 12 ACC members which, represents a doubling in ACC member usage since the announcement of the Core as an ACC Shared Resource in July 2013. Thus, as cancer research using mouse models continues to expand, Core utilization by ACC members is predicted to grow substantially."
"9405337","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):      Mild-moderate traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is the signature injury of both Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts and leads to significant disability. During the chronic phase of mTBI, a consistent funding is a decreased cerebral glucose utilization in both humans and animals. Glucose and its intermediate metabolites are essential fuels to maintain neuronal cell function. The decreased supply of glucose and its intermediary metabolite in the brain also lead to memory loss, a common findings in patients with mTBI. To date, strategies that target improvements in brain glucose utilization have not been employed in paradigms for mTBI rehabilitation. Objective: using mouse model of mTBI to study long-term effects of mTBI on brain glucose utilization, neurobehavioral recovery, and their inter-relationships. Specific aims: (1) to longitudinally characterize and modify an established mouse mTBI model that demonstrates persistent neurobehavioral impairments, (2) to determine whether such impairments are associated with altered expression of proteins and genes related to glucose utilization in discrete brain areas, and (3) to assess as a proof of concept whether augmenting endogenous incretin hormone, GLP-1, via a specific dietary intervention ameliorates these chronic neurobehavioral and biomarker abnormalities. Hypothesis: (1) Chronic mTBI decreases expression of glucose utilization related transporters and enzymes in specific brain regions, in association with impaired neurobehavioral functions. (2) Augmentation of endogenous GLP- 1during the post-acute phase of TBI improves expression of brain glucose utilization related transporters/enzymes and related neurobehavioral outcomes in the above mTBI model. Methods: The repetitive mild closed-skull traumatic brain injuries within 24 or 96 hours will be used to generate mouse model of mTBI. This mouse mTBI model will be used for three experiments proposed: (1) determining the time course of chronic (> 7 weeks) neurobehavioral impairments in this mouse mTBI model: Morris water maze for learning and memory test; the rotarotor for motor coordination; and 2-bottle sucrose/water preference test for anhedonia; (2) measuring the temporal relationships between neurobehavioral impairments and expression of glucose utilization related transporters and enzymes in discrete brain regions, such as cortex (frotal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe and occipital lobe), corpus callosum, hippocampus, thalamus, and hypothalamus; (3) examining whether increasing endogenous GLP-1 by a specific dietary intervention enhances expression of glucose utilization related biomarkers and neurobehavioral recovery in mTBI mice. The results from proposed studies will provide necessary data for further collaborative researches that will inform additional basic science and translational investigations on chronic phase of mTBI; and for more detailed cellular and molecular mechanistic studies on prolonged decreased brain glucose utilization following mTBI. Our long term goal is to improve the management of mTBI in both Veterans and non-Veterans, based upon reversing their impaired brain glucose metabolism."
"9384220","Project Summary  In skin epithelium, a population of progenitor cells distinctly capable of proliferation, self-renewal, and terminal differentiation into post-mitotic progeny, is responsible to sustain tissue homeostasis throughout life. Unlike proliferation and apoptosis, cell fate choices are currently assessed using qualitative or indirect assays. As a result, we lack full understanding of how progenitors balance proliferation with differentiation during skin development and homeostasis, or in growth disorders of the skin.  Our long-term objective is to establish how epidermal progenitor cells balance growth in the presence of oncogenic mutations to maintain tissue homeostasis. To do so, we developed a novel assay to directly quantify rates of progenitor cell self-renewal and differentiation in epidermis during homeostatic and hyperproliferative growth. We will employ our assay in the mouse models engineered to express physiological levels of constitutively active Hras and Pik3ca in the skin. In addition, we will use our recently developed rapid gene- targeting method, to explore how specific effectors and substrates of RAS-PI3K signaling modify epidermal differentiation in vivo.  This application aims to test the hypotheses that: 1.) Increased differentiation can balance mitogenic effects of oncogenic signaling to maintain tissue homeostasis; 2.) Ras effector Pik3ca initiates a molecular cascade that includes Akt and specific Akt substrates to regulate progenitor cell renewal and differentiation in skin epidermis; and 3.) Epidermal progenitor response to oncogene expression is heterogeneous and influenced by progenitor cell niche.  The results of our research are expected to immediately uncover cellular and molecular principles that maintain skin homeostasis and functionality despite the abundance of growth-promoting mutations. These findings will be a critical step in development of pharmacological strategies to manipulate progenitor cell potential in the epidermis, to treat conditions marked by unrestrained tissue growth."
"9294031","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Over the past 6 years, we have established a unique, NIH funded, Clinical Research Center focused on the physiology of middle ear (ME) pressure (MEP) regulation. The integrating theme is the role played by MEP disregulation (MEPD) in the pathogenesis of otitis media (OM) with effusion (OME). We are requesting 5 years of NIH support to further develop this research theme. We include three Projects supported by two Cores. Project 1 evaluates MEP-regulation during health and disease, defines the diagnostic utility of current and newly developed methods to assess MEP-regulation, explores those physiological mechanisms that potentially modulate MEP-regulation and initiates the transfer of these tests and results to the clinical environment. Project 2 is a continuation of an ongoing, 5-year follow-up of three groups of children who were entered at 3 years of age with a documented history of chronic OME, recurrent acute OM or no significant OM. For each group, we are following the children to 7-8 years of age with repeated evaluations of MEP-regulation using standardized test protocols and periodic measures of the anatomy of the Eustachian tube (ET)/ME system. These data will be used to define the differences in ET/ME anatomy and function between groups at each age, the changes in anatomy and function for each group with growth and development, and the effect of the anatomical substrate on function. The goals are to determine if any anatomic or functional measure predicts group assignment and if any of the measures predict the future course of disease in a given child. Project 5 continues our work on modeling MEP-regulation for normal and diseased MEs. These models are used to develop functional-anatomic relationships, to aid in the interpretation of data from the Projects and to define possible treatment options for OME. Core A administers the Center, guides its future direction and provides data entry and statistical services to all Projects. Core B develops new tests, protocols and instruments to assess MEP-regulation and provides all testing/imaging services required by the three Projects. This Clinical Research Center is unique in its focus on MEP-regulation and the role played by MEPD in OME pathogenesis."
"9345311","PROJECT SUMMARY Persistent, pervasive healthcare disparities disproportionately affect racial and ethnic minority communities. Training health professionals to work effectively with people from different cultures; organizational policies, procedures, and practices that address the needs of racial, ethnic, and other underserved populations; and establishing relationships between health organizations and other organizations serving the same populations are critical to equitable care. Culturally competent healthcare can significantly increase the equity of care for racial and ethnic minorities to ultimately reduce health disparities. The goal of proposed Phase II research and development effort is to complete the design and production of JourneyStart, a research-based, computer- assisted cultural competency assessment and action planning toolkit to increase the capacity of small- to medium-sized health organizations to better meet the needs of racial and ethnic minorities. Specifically, the proposed effort will: (1) refine the data functions of JourneyStart; (2) design the technical assistance functions of JourneyStart; and (3) assess the implementation and utility of JourneyStart based on feedback from a sample of small- to mid-sized health organizations that work at the community level. Approximately 15 health organizations will be recruited to test the entire spectrum of services available from JourneyStart, from assessment to action planning, and the interface with the system. Staff from the organizations will participate in an evaluation to discuss the components and utility of system, including (a) ease of the interface and use, (b) limitations, and (c) recommendations for packaging the services. To develop JourneyStart?s benchmarking capability, clusters of organizations will be established based on analysis of the organizations? size, demographics of the people they serve, and geographic location,. The aims of the proposed research align both with the mission of the National Institutes of Health to apply knowledge to enhance health and life and its goal to foster fundamental creative discoveries, innovative research strategies, and research applications for protecting and improving health. Furthermore, the proposed product will advance the mission of the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD) to promote minority health and support efforts that reduce health disparities, along with the commitment of NIMHD to support interventions and translational research that address cultural competency and social determinants of health."
"9304372","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): A burgeoning literature suggests that sleep spindles mediate sleep-dependent memory consolidation and cognitive function more generally. At the same time, several recent studies show that sleep spindles are dramatically reduced in SZ. Cognitive deficits are a core feature of schizophrenia (SZ) that underlie significant functional disability and effective treatments are lacking. Previous work from our laboratories links the sleep spindle deficit with an impairment of sleep-dependent memory consolidation, IQ and executive function in SZ, and suggests that it is treatable. But it is unclear whether this sleep spindle deficit is present early in SZ, and whether it reflects a core disturbance central to its pathophysiology and familial risk of illness. In this study, we will examine sleep spindles, their relationship to memory consolidation and cognition more generally, and their neural underpinnings in early-course patients both with SZ (E-SZ; n=30), and with other psychoses (E-NSZ; n=30), in young relatives of SZ patients at familial high risk for SZ (FHR; n=60) and in healthy comparison (HC) subjects matched for age, sex and parental socioeconomic status. We hypothesize (i) that E-SZ and FHR, but not E-NSZ, will show reduced spindles compared with HC; (ii) that spindle number and density will correlate with sleep-dependent memory consolidation, IQ and overall cognitive function in all groups, and that deficient sleep spindles will correlate with positive and prodromal symptoms in E-SZ and FHR; and (iii) that during the sleep that follows motor task learning, HC and E-NSZ, but not E-SZ or FHR participants, will show increased spindle density and coherence, specifically in the motor network. We also predict that reduced spindle density will correlate with a reduction in thalamocortical functional and structural connectivity. Our hypotheses, if confirmed, will help establish the sleep spindle deficit as (i) an endophenotype of SZ, which can serve as a biomarker of familial risk (for studying the etiopathology of SZ), and (ii) a target for novel treatments of cognitive impairment."
"9340973","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The proposed UCSF Core Center for Musculoskeletal Biology in Medicine (CCMBM) will be an interdisciplinary consortium of thirty-nine basic and clinical scientists dedicated to understanding the biology and pathophysiology of musculoskeletal disease. The goal is to stimulate and support transdisciplinary collaborations amongst existing, premier research programs at UCSF in order to accelerate translational research in osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. A fundamental challenge for bench-to-bedside translational research is the need to validate in humans the findings from small animal models. The proposed CCMBM will overcome this obstacle by forming a linkage between scientists who study disease biology, researchers who analyze vast archives of clinical data, and practitioners who actively treat patients. The UCSF CCMBM proposes three cores: 1) Skeletal Biology Core; 2) Musculoskeletal and Quantitative Imaging Core; and 3) Epidemiology and Biostatistics Core. These cores will provide research support and technical training, as well as a venue for new collaborations and an entry point for new members. The Center will also foster scientific exchange through an Enrichment Program; the curriculum includes a monthly seminar featuring local and visiting scientists, an annual full-day retreat with the External Advisory board, and a quarterly half-day symposium with a rotating topic relevant to osteoporosis and osteoarthritis. Another vital component of the Center is its Pilot/Feasibility Program. This provides seed money to junior investigators and to scientists new to musculoskeletal research. Finally, the Tool and Technology Grant Program will provide funds to Center members for the purpose of utilizing the outstanding specialized research services available outside the CCMBM at UCSF. Overall, the funding base for the proposed CCMBM is robust, support from UCSF is strong, and opportunities for interactions within and outside the Center are numerous. The object of the Center is to make optimum use of all available resources to catalyze discovery in the basic biology of musculoskeletal disease."
"9348643","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  The long term goal of the proposed research is to transform traditional cancer therapy protocols by including a pre-treatment step involving perturbing the vasculature of tumors with ultrasound- activated microbubbles (MBs). The new paradigm in cancer treatment protocol will result in significant increases in tumor kill using radiation, chemotherapy, hyperthermia or a combination of therapies. The technique further allows targeting of tumor specific volumes allowing healthy tissues to be spared because a lower dose of therapy can be applied. The American Cancer Society estimates that approximately 571,950 cancer deaths in America will occur in 2011 and about 1,596,670 new cases of cancer will occur in the U.S. The National Institutes of Health estimates overall costs of cancer in 2010 at $263.8 billion. However, these trends are improving because of continued developments in diagnostics and therapy. Therefore, continued improvements in these trends will depend on continued advancements in diagnostics and therapy. Our novel cancer therapy technique is based on using ultrasound-activated MBs in a way that will fundamentally change cancer therapy by amplifying the effects of treatment on cell death and spatially targeting therapy.  We have recently discovered that ultrasound and MB-mediated cellular perturbation can enhance killing of cells in vitro from radiation or hyperthermia. Furthermore, we have demonstrated in animal models in vivo that ultrasound-activated MB perturbation of tumor vasculature results in significant enhancement in tumor kill when followed by traditional cancer therapy. Despite our emerging data on the ability of MBs to amplify therapeutic response of cells in vitro and in vivo, it is necessary to optimize this comprehensively, explore possible mechanisms responsible for these findings, and further test this phenomenon in vivo. The medical significance of adopting these techniques clinically is substantial because it could markedly improve existing therapies and reduce the side-effects associated with traditional therapies. Therefore, we propose a set of three specific aims to test, develop, optimize, demonstrate and quantify the efficacy of this novel technique. The first specific aim is to characterize the observed response by quantifying gene expression and cell signaling pathways relevant to therapy enhancement resulting from exposure to ultrasound-activated MBs. This specific aim (SA1) will be completed by conducting cell culture studies on cancer cell lines, conducting assays to examine cell signaling pathways associated with ultrasound-activated MB perturbation, and using animal models with ceramide deficient pathways. The second and third specific aims are to quantify, assess, and optimize the ability of ultrasound-activated MBs to synergistically enhance therapeutic response of tumors in vivo to radiation (SA 2), and to hyperthermia (SA 3). To meet these aims, several animal models of cancer will be exposed to the therapy techniques using different sets of exposure conditions and the efficacy of these therapies and exposure conditions assessed in vivo."
"9385494","Abstract The pediatric and adult transplant programs at Duke University Medical Center have served as a core clinical center for the BMT-CTN since its establishment in 2001. As a core center, Duke has made significant contributions to the network, including enrollment of 310 patients on CTN protocols, chairing two protocols (Dr. Kurtzberg chaired 0501 and Dr. Horwitz chaired 0901); serving on 6 protocol committees and 2 disease committees, authoring manuscripts and establishing and managing the immune reconstitution core for protocol 0501. The center has been in compliance with accurate and timely data and bio-specimen submission. The PI and Co-PI have regularly attended steering committee meetings, conference calls and the SSOS meetings. For this renewal of the BMT-CTN, Duke brings three specialized types of expertise to the table, (1) a long- standing and pioneering role in cord blood transplantation and banking and (2) unique experience in the treatment of pediatric patients with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for non-malignant diseases and (3) pioneering work in cord blood and cord-tissue derived cellular therapies. In this application, Duke has added two additional centers as part of a Duke Consortium to increase participation in the network and also to increase accrual to BMT-CTN trials. The study concept proposed in this application, will serve as the foundation for a follow-on study to BMT-CTN 0501. The clinical trial proposed will compare in a randomized phase II clinical trial, the outcomes of related haplo-identical bone marrow transplantation or unrelated donor cord blood transplantation in children with high risk leukemias undergoing myeloablative conditioning therapy. The supportive care will be standardized. The preparative regimens and GvHD prophylaxis will be based on treatment `packages' well studied for the cord blood group and piloted for the haplo-BMT group. They are standardized to the extent possible, with the splitting cyclophosphamide for pre and post-transplant dosing for the haplo group and use of fludarabine in the cord blood group. The primary endpoint will be relapse-free survival at 2 years post-transplant. Overall survival, engraftment, acute and chronic Graft-versus-Host Disease, treatment related mortality, immune reconstitution, and transplant feasibility will also be explored as secondary endpoints. The predictive role of MRD at the time of transplant will also be examined to determine if either graft source offers better protection against post- transplant leukemic relapse. This study will answer critical and timely questions about the role of various alternative donors and identification of best practices for alternative donor selection for transplantation of children with hematological malignancies lacking matched related or unrelated donors. We plan to fund this trial by responding to the FOA Clinical Coordinating Center for Multi-Site Investigator- Initiated Clinical Trials (Collaborative UG3/UH3) PAR-16-300, which is due on February 13, 2017. Dr. Mary Eapen, from the CIBMTR, will serve as the PI for the grant application for the Data Coordinating Center which will utilize the infra-structure already established for the BMT-CTN. We have full support of the group at Johns Hopkins who developed the haplo post-transplant cyclophosphamide approach, The CIBMTR and the pediatric transplant community to conduct this study and prioritize accrual to the trial. Accordingly, we expect to accrue 180 patients in 3-4 years and, with two-year follow-up and data analysis, expect to complete the study in <6 years."
"9359396","Project Summary  The Cancer Therapeutics Program has been continuously approved by the NCI CCSG since 1993. The  Program seeks to improve patient outcomes through the rapid development of novel research ideas which are  translatable to the clinical arena and ideally can be individualized to disease and patient-specific settings. The  Programmatic goals are as follows: 1) Bring forward novel preclinical breakthroughs from the bench to the  bedside and bring relevant cancer therapeutics from the clinic to the lab in order to enhance the mechanistic  understanding of cancer therapeutics; 2) Take new drugs from first-in-human Phase I trials to disease-specific  clinical trials that will have a significant impact on establishing new standards of care; and 3) Develop  pharmacodynamic and predictive markers to select the best drugs for the patients most likely to respond.  These goals are applied across four research themes: targeted therapies, combinations to overcome  resistance, immunotherapy, and predictive and pharmacodynamic biomarkers. This Program, which was rated  as ?Excellent? at the time of the prior CCSG renewal application, is led by Program Co-Leaders Drs. Ravi  Amaravadi and Naomi Haas, who were jointly appointed in September 2013. They succeed Drs. Peter  O'Dwyer and Corey Langer, who were asked to become leaders of new cross-Programmatic translational  research Initiatives in pancreatic and lung cancer, respectively. The new Co-Leaders were chosen because  they have complementary skill sets that match the future directions of the Program. Dr. Amaravadi has  expertise in the preclinical-to-translational space, and Dr. Haas has expertise in taking Phase I studies into  disease-specific studies and developing multi-institution clinical trials. Drs. Amaravadi and Haas are NCI-  funded researchers who bring their scientific vision, innovativeness and energy to this Program, which includes  an emphasis on basic and translational research. The 25 Program members represent 10 departments in the  Perelman School of Medicine. During the current project period, translational research has continued to be a  major focus. Members currently have $6.7M in annual research grant funding (direct costs), of which $3.6M is  peer-reviewed and $2.4M is NCI-funded. There have been a total of 361 cancer-related publications authored  by Program members during the project period. Of these, 12% are intra-Programmatic, 39% are inter-  Programmatic and 57% are multi-institutional."
"9236789","Over two decades ago, NIH estimated costs associated with self-injurious behavior (SIB) associated with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD) exceeded $3 billion (US). There is little reason to think the prevalence estimates have changed but assuredly the costs of care have. Despite progress in the behavioral assessment and treatment of individual SIB cases, our scientific understanding of risk for the disorder remains severely limited. One consequence of the `wait till it develops' approach is that individual SIB cases tend to be treated long after the onset of the disorder making it a clinically difficult and expensive (and often intractable) problem. Contrary to our own predictions, it has become clear that in very young children with developmental delay, variables typically considered as SIB `risk factors' (e.g., poor expressive language) may have prognostic value but do little to separate children on initial risk. Equally clear is there may be individual difference markers which should be considered in an integrated bio-behavioral model of SIB risk to stratify vulnerable children with more precision into `high/low' risk groups. Based on our work to date, the following framework has emerged: (1) there is a subgroup of very young children with IDD with altered peripheral innervation and immune cell activity; (2) this may be part of the biological substrate for the development of a phenotype characterized by abnormal patterns of sensory responsiveness. We hypothesize that SIB is more likely to emerge in cases that have this early phenotype. We have already established that peripheral innervation, immune cell activity, and abnormal sensory responsiveness can be objectively and reliably measured very early in children with developmental delays, prior to the onset of SIB. The overall objective of this application is to apply a prospective developmental approach to model SIB risk. Accordingly, we hypothesize the subgroup of children with (i) altered peripheral sensory innervation, (ii) increased inflammatory and immune activity, and (iii) increased sensory reactivity will be at the highest etiological risk for SIB. The outcomes will have clinical impact because (a) current methods of assessment and treatment of SIB rely on the emergence of SIB and thus likely miss early opportunities for greater biological and behavioral plasticity, and (b) the putative risk markers being investigated provide plausible and novel targets in a shift towards early prevention of this devastating and costly clinical condition."
"9312895","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Identification of end phenotypes in the behavioral-variant of front temporal dementia    the purpose of this proposal is to develop the expertise necessary to establish an independent lab investigating end phenotypes in young-onset neurodegenerative conditions. The behavioral-variant of fronto temporal dementia (bvFTD) is the most common clinical phenotype in front temporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) spectrum disorders. Clinically, bvFTD includes progressive decline in social conduct and executive function associated with two major classes of underlying neuropathology: inclusions composed of the microtubule-binding protein, tau (i.e. FTLD-tau), and inclusions of the RNA-binding protein, TDP-43 (i.e. FTLD- TDP). Current drug development efforts are focused on prevention of pathological tau or TDP-43 aggregation in the brain. Although 20% of cases have a pathogenic mutation resulting in FTLD-tau or FTLD-TDP, most cases are sporadic and there is currently no reliable way to detect the underlying molecular etiology in living patients, posing a significant challenge for clinical trials of these emerging therapies.   The scientific goal of thi proposal is to subdivide bvFTD into screening phenotypes with biological relevance (i.e. end phenotypes) with the hypothesis that differing patterns of neuron-to-neuron spread of tau and TDP aggregations in bvFTD are associated with unique clinical and genetic features that can be detected ante mortem. Aim#1 will use a novel approach to quantify differences in regional spread of neuropathology within front temporal networks for comparative study in bvFTD with FTLD-tau vs. FTLD-TDP. Aim#2 will examine the diagnostic value of risk alleles identified in previous case-control FTLD genome-wide association studies in autopsied sporadic bvFTD, and assess their relationship to QRP map pathology burden. Aim 3 will integrate clinical and genetic markers in Aims #1 and 2 using advanced statistical techniques in patient classification to identify end phenotypes. Successful completion of these projects will have immediate utility for clinical practice and trial design for disease-modifying therapies in bvFTD. Through work on these specific aims, the structured career development plan will expand the candidate's training to include novel approaches to digital quantitative neuropathology, social cognition, neurogenesis and advanced statistical methods of patient classification under guidance from internationally-recognized leaders in the field. The proposed work will serve as the basis for a future R01 proposal studying prospective multimodal biomarker changes in these end phenotypes."
"9313192","RCDC Project Summary The goal of the Research Career Development Component (RCDC) of the Pittsburgh Older Americans Independence Center (OAIC) is to create a new generation of investigators with expertise in age-related mobility and balance research.

"9319041","Renal epithelial cell plasma membranes are divided into two domains whose distinct biochemical compositions reflect their individual roles. This polarity is required for vectorial solute and fluid transport in the kidney. To achieve this asymmetry, an epithelial cell must be able to establish distinct surface domains and to maintain these domains' distinct identities. The generation and maintenance of epithelial polarity is dependent upon the formation of contacts between neighboring cells, which initiates signals that activate the assembly of intercellular junctions and their associated polarization machinery. We and others have shown that adenosine monophosphate-stimulated protein kinase (AMPK) plays a key role in the formation of intercellular junctions and in the establishment of polarity. AMPK is a cellular energy sensor activated by intracellular ATP depletion that helps to protect tissues from the consequences of energy deprivation. AMPK governs numerous pathways that modulate cell growth and metabolism. Extracellular calcium plays a critical and complex role in inducing junction assembly, and we find that the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR) contributes to calcium- dependent junction assembly. We have also found that initiation of junction formation leads to inhibition of the GSK3? kinase, which regulates a number of cell differentiation and polarization signaling pathways. We wish to understand the roles that AMPK, GSK3?, the CaSR and other regulatory molecules play in the establishment and preservation of epithelial polarity under normal circumstances and in the face of pathological perturbations such as energy deprivation. We propose to determine 1) how modulation of the activities of AMPK, GSK3? and the CaSR initiate tight junction formation and influence tight junction protein expression; 2) how the AMPK, GSK3? and CaSR pathways influence established junctions in intact epithelia; and 3) how loss of AMPK activity affects renal function and the susceptibility of renal tubular epithelial cells to ischemic damage. Through these studies, we will identify new regulatory targets and control points in the complex process of epithelial polarization. We will also invesigate cellular pathways involved in acute kidney injury and possible therapeutic interventions that may mitigate its severity."
"9312974","The Pilot and Feasibility (P/F) Project Program of the Center has been its most successful undertaking. From the beginning, the primary focus of our P/F Project Award Program has been the young investigator seeking to establish independent status as a scientist. A secondary focus was the established investigator seeking new directions in their research. The final eligibility category included scientists with established reputations in other scientific areas who were considering initiatives in gastrointestinal research. The majority of the P/F Awards during the current funding period were granted to investigators in the first category. Many of these awards resulted in new career development awards or independent research grant funding. Thus the P/F grant program has helped to launch numerous young investigators at University of Michigan into research careers that will have impact on digestive health and diseases. To continue this program, we are requesting $80,000 per year to support the P/F program. The money will be used to fund 4 awards at $20,000 each for one year. The GI Division will provide an additional $10,000 per project to bring the total to $30,000 per project. To maximize the number of P/F awards funded per year and to enhance collaboration between Centers so to encourage interdisciplinary projects, we have joined with the UM Cancer Center to co-fund a pilot feasibility study that involves cancer biology. The annual cost of this particular P/F study is $40,000, of which the UMCGR funds $20,000 and the remaining $20,000 is supported from the UM Cancer Center (UMCCC P30 CA046592). We have made a similar arrangement with the Michigan Nutrition Obesity Research Center (MNORC P30 DK089503) to co-fund another P/F study focused on metabolomics and capped at $50,000, of which the UMCGR funds up to $25,000 and the MNORC to fund up to $25,000. The total of up to $45,000 to co-fund these two additional P/F projects is provided by funds committed by the Department of Medicine (see attached letter). This demonstrates the institution's commitment to our Center and to career development of junior faculty. Leveraging institutional support and collaboration with other UM Centers of Excellence, the UMCGR will be able to fund 6 P/F awards annually. Over the past ten years, pilot projects representing a total investment of $1,050,000 direct costs, ($1,577,500 total costs) have generated 20 NIH awards (2 K08, 2 R21, R03, R00, 2 U01, U19 and 11 R01s) totaling $18,132,140 direct costs ($27,142,287 total costs); a 17 fold return on investment."
"9277486","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposed MIRA project employs a range of multi-disciplinary approaches toward the discovery and analysis of natural products and the biosynthetic pathways that assemble and modify complex metabolites. The proposal covers three areas that have been supported by NIGMS during the past 20 years. Each has been articulated as a Grand Challenge designed to complement our accomplishments and continue to push forward vigorously to discover new knowledge and offer solutions with high potential for improving human health. Grand Challenge I of this MIRA application is based on the exciting momentum of a highly productive and collaborative program lead by my group that focuses on the pikromycin (Pik), erythromycin (DEBS), tylosin (Tyl), curacin (Cur) and bryostatin (Bry) pathways whose detailed analysis has been further developed during the previous cycle of support. These systems each bear fascinating biochemical features that will expand our understanding of substrate selectivity, and structural characteristics that enable functional activity within and between native and engineered polyketide synthase/non-ribosomal peptide synthetase modules. Grand Challenge II of this proposal focuses on studies relating to natural product pathway tailoring enzymes. A fundamental aspect of structural diversification in secondary metabolism involves oxidative processes that contribute significantly to biological activity. This can be readily appreciated in a number of important molecules that are clinical therapeutic agents, or show significant potential as drug leads. Based on the important successes in our research relating to P450 substrate and enzyme engineering over the past four years, we have been emboldened to expand our work in exciting new directions. This includes plans to investigate a range of P450 monoxygenases that catalyze iterative oxidative processes. We will also investigate monooxygenases that catalyze C-C coupling involving substrates in both inter- and intramolecular oxidation reactions, including aromatic, alkyl and alkenyl functional groups. One of the most underexplored, yet very important classes of tailoring enzyme includes the acyl/peptidyl carrier protein dependent monooxygenases, and we propose to explore mechanisms of selectivity and proceed with efforts to expand their substrate recognition and biocatalytic properties. Grand Challenge III focuses on natural product discovery and pathway engineering. We have established the technologies and bioinformatics capabilities to readily assemble and mine genomic, and metagenomic datasets from diverse microbiome populations toward natural product gene cluster discovery, which is now poised for heterologous expression in amenable microbial hosts. The next wave of progress will rely on ready identification of the most novel pathways, and our ability to express them using facile synthetic biology methods. We plan to attack these problems with utmost energy and determination to gain access to important compounds with valuable medicinal properties."
"9316592","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lower urinary tract symptoms are prevalent, distressing, and costly for women across the life span. They are characterized by storage, voiding, and postmicturition symptoms, and associated with urinary tract infections, overactive bladder, and bladder pain syndrome. The occurrence of lower urinary tract symptoms implies an abnormal or unhealthy bladder. Promotion of bladder health through treatment of modifiable risk factors and improving bladder habits may decrease the incidence of these symptoms over a woman's lifetime. Our long-term goal is to develop effective interventions to reduce the lifetime risk of lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary tract infections in women across four life-stage groups: adolescent girls (pre-reproductive years); young adult (reproductive years), midlife (post- reproductive years) and older women (65 years and older). We plan to: 1) examine the utility of an adaption of the Symptom Management Model to identify risk and protective factors that predict bladder health in the four life-stages; 2) examine the shared and unique impact of risk and protective factors on lower urinary tract symptoms and urinary tract infection in women in each of the four age groups; and 3) design and conduct qualitative and cohort studies and clinical trials in collaboration with PLUS Research Consortium members that are focused on identifying and reducing risk factors related to bladder health in women. Specifically, we will conduct an evidence synthesis on the risk and protective factors and preventive interventions for lower urinary tract symptoms; use qualitative methodology to describe adolescent girls and women's bladder health experiences and their symptom management strategies; develop an instrument to be used in longitudinal studies in consortium sites based on our qualitative research results; and use epidemiological and electronic health record databases (including clinical data and claims data) to determine risk factors for urinary tract infections in women. In addition, we will design and conduct multisite observational studies and randomized controlled trials in collaboration with PLUS Research Consortium to identify and reduce risk factors associated with bladder health in selected female populations."
"9305085","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The goal of the Molecular Biology Program at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus is to train outstanding research scientists and academicians who will become future leaders in their chosen fields and disciplines. To accomplish this goal we carefully select high quality students from diverse backgrounds with strong academic records and a demonstrated aptitude, commitment and passion for research. The training program is flexible and highly student orientated to meet individual needs, but at the same time has a rigorous curriculum, sets high standards. Molecular Biology is designed as a 5-6 year program with the first year devoted to challenging course work and laboratory rotations, the second year to the development of a research hypothesis, and the remaining years to completion of the thesis research project under the guidance of a training faculty mentor and thesis committee. To further develop research skills, students at all stages of the curriculum participate in additional program specific activities including a weekly seminar series, roundtable discussions, the annual symposium and our retreat. Our curriculum strongly emphasizes the development of critical and creative independent thinking, quantitative and statistical abilities, scientific communication skills, and professional/responsible conduct. A significant strength of the program is its outstanding and highly interactive faculty from 15 different departments who are deeply committed to graduate education and to the Program. As the only NIH-supported training program on our campus focused on research into fundamental molecular and cellular mechanisms, program faculty labs offer research opportunities for our students in multiple disciplines (structure, immunology, cell biology and biochemistry), disease models (cancer, autoimmunity, infectious diseases, and developmental disorders), and organismal models (viruses, bacteria, yeast, tetrahymena, flies, worms, mice and humans). The training success of our program is evident in student publications and in the high quality postdoctoral, faculty and industry positions obtained by our students. Given the depth, quality and diversity of our student pool and our demonstrated ability to train high quality students, we are requesting an increase in student positions to be supported by this training grant from 6 to 8/yr."
"9529994","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Of the three ras genes, kras is most frequently mutated in human cancer. Ras proteins are highly homologous but differ extensively in their C-terminal hypervariable regions that direct post-translational modifications (e.g. farnesylation) and membrane targeting. We discovered a post-translational modification unique to K-Ras: protein kinase C (PKC) mediated phosphorylation. We found that phosphorylation of K-Ras at serine 181 partially neutralized the adjacent polybasic stretch of amino acids and thereby activated a farnesyl-electrostatic switch that resulted in release of K-Ras from the plasma membrane and association with intracellular membranes, including the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus and the outer mitochondrial membrane. Most intriguing, K-Ras translocation to internal membranes was associated with cell death. Bryostatin 1, a potent PKC agonist, showed anti-tumor activity that was dependent on K-Ras serine 181. In the first cycle of this grant we proposed to expand upon these discoveries with three Aims: 1) Regulation of the farnesyl-electrostatic switch, 2) Mechanisms of phospho-K-Ras mediated apoptosis and 3) The Role of C-terminal phosphorylation of K-Ras in mouse tumor models. Much progress has been made on each aim. Most exciting are our discoveries that K-Ras signals for cell death from the cytoplasmic face of the ER, that Bcl-XL is required for phospho-K-Ras mediated cell death, and that phospho-K-Ras forms a trimolecular complex with Bcl-XL and the IP3 receptor (IP3R) and regulates the calcium channel activity. We have also been successful in constructing a double knock-in mouse that harbors a conditional oncogenic K-Ras allele that lacks the phosphorylation site at amino acid 181 (LSL-K-Ras12D181A). In this competing renewal application we propose to continue our studies with three aims: Aim 1: Regulation of the IP3 Receptor (IP3R) by phospho-K-Ras. We will characterize both structurally (protein-protein interactions) and functionally (electrophysiology) the molecular interactions between phospho-K-Ras, Bcl-XL and IP3R. We will ascertain if phospho-K-Ras alters mitochondrial calcium homeostasis. We will determine if IP3R, calpain and autophagy are required for phospho-K-Ras mediated cell death. Aim 2: Analysis of K-Ras Phosphorylation at Serine 181 in vivo. We will use our newly created LSL-K-Ras12D181A mice in two Cre- driven tumor models to test the hypothesis that phosphorylation at serine 181 negatively regulates K-Ras oncogenicity and we will use the same models to show that the efficacy of bryostatin 1 depends on phosphorylation of serine 181. Aim 3: Analysis of K-Ras Phosphorylation at Serine 181 in Human Tumor Cells. We will correlate susceptibility of human tumor cells lines with K-Ras mutation status and generate isogenic lines of human tumor cells with and without a phosphorylation site at position 181. We anticipate that our mechanistic studies of the cell biology of phospho-K-Ras along with our in vivo and human tumor cell analyses will reveal unique features of this important oncogene that can be exploited in developing anti-cancer drugs."
"9310063","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Pulmonary fibrosis is a currently untreatable condition with a high mortality rate. One central common step in the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis is the differentiation and expansion of pathologic fibroblasts that are largely responsible for the excess production of collagen and other extracellular matrix components that characterize tissue fibrosis. Transforming growth factor beta (TGF?) is a critical driver of fibroblast differentiation and expansion. The applicants have identified a single integrin (?v?1) on the surface of fibroblasts that is responsible for fibroblast-mediated TGF? activation. They have taken advantage of extensive experience in developing integrin inhibitors to generate a small molecule that is the first potent and highly selective inhibitor of ?v?1 and have shown that this drug can inhibit bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis when administered beginning 14 days after bleomycin, during the late fibrotic phase in this model. They now propose to chemically modify this lead compound to optimize its potency, bioavailability and tolerability, with the goal, in the first two years, of generating at least one lead drug that will be suitable fr oral or sub- cutaneous administration. Direct administration into the airways will be assessed, if necessary, as a back-up strategy. The applicants will also use labeled versions of lead compounds to assess the cell and tissue distribution of the target and develop assays for flow cytometry and potentially in vivo imaging. In the final 3 years of this two stage proposal the applicants will thoroughly evaluate the pharmacokinetics, stability, dose- response potency and toxicology of the most promising drug developed in the first two years, will scale up synthesis and generate GLP quality drug to perform 7 day and 28 day GLP- toxicity studies in rats and Beagle dogs to enable submission of an IND for first in man studies to the FDA. Because the results of this series of studies cannot be entirely predicted, the applicants will also continue a vigorous chemical modification, synthesis and evaluation pipeline to be sure that there are multiple additional promising candidates if the chosen lead compound fails at any step of the pre-clinical work-up. With this strategy there should be a high likelihood of generating an ?v?1-targeting drug suitable for clinical trials."
"9312950","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the Pluripotent Stem Cell and Organoid Core of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to provide new, cutting edge technologies that are focused on digestive disease research and enable the use of tissue organoids to model human disease. The Core pursues this goal with four complementary aims. In the first aim ?to provide DHC investigators with quality tested PSCs and PSC-derived GI tissues,? the Core makes available to users quality-tested human pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and PSC-derived intestinal and gastric organoids. These are novel 3D-miniature organs that enable studies related to physiology and pathobiology relevant to humans. In the second aim ?to generate biopsy-derived human enteroids for DHC investigators,? the Core also provides investigators with the opportunity to generate gastric, intestinal, and colonic ?enteroids? from healthy or diseased subjects. In the third aim ?to derive and quality test disease-specific induced PSC,? the Core applies well-established transfection, culture, and phenotyping protocols to generate inducible PSCs (iPSCs) from normal and diseased subjects to facilitate studies of pathogenesis of disease, drug screening, etc. To be able to track and visualize these cells in experimental assays, the Core also provide PSC-editing and screening services to establish novel cell lines based on investigators' needs. And in the fourth aim ?to sponsor training courses and workshops on PSC and organoid technology,? the Core holds regular sessions on basic and advanced techniques for PSC culture, generation of iPSCs, and generation and use of human digestive tissue organoids. These novel technologies empower DHC investigators to study mechanisms of disease using multi-cellular experimental systems that have direct ?lineage? to normal and diseased human tissues (including at different stages of maturation). The delivery of services is streamlined and centralized, and positions investigators to explore new collaborative projects."
"9352473","Project Summary ? Project 3 Convulsant chemical threat agents, such as the GABAA receptor blocker tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) and the organophosphate (OP) cholinesterase inhibitor diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), can trigger seizures that progress to life-threatening status epilepticus (SE). Survivors face significant, long-term morbidity, including mild-to-severe memory loss, affective disorders and recurrent seizures (epilepsy). Current medical counter- measures fail to sufficiently protect against these neurological deficits. It is hypothesized that neuroprotection will be enhanced by: (1) improving seizure control, and (2) combining antiseizure treatment with agents that mitigate neuroinflammation and/or Ca2+ dysregulation. During the first project period, we developed a mouse model of TETS-induced SE and refined a rat model of DFP-induced SE for use in neuroprotection studies. Using these preclinical models, Projects 1 and 2 showed that allopregnanolone, a positive allosteric modulator of GABAA receptors, was a superior countermeasure for TETS-induced SE, particularly when administered at delayed times. Allopregnanolone alone or in combination with midazolam did not terminate DFP-induced SE, but the combined intramuscular administration of midazolam, allopregnanolone and a low dose of perampanel, a potent AMPA receptor antagonist, was highly effective in terminating DFP-induced behavioral and electrographic SE without causing significant sedation. We also discovered in a screen of candidate neuro- protectants that post-exposure treatment with dantrolene, a Ca2+ channel stabilizer, reduced neurodegeneration, and that a novel small molecule dual inhibitor of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX- 2) attenuated microglial activation. Core A found that sEH inhibitors (sEHI) also normalized the hypotension associated with high-dose diazepam or midazolam. In the second project period, we will quantify the effects of antiseizure and neuroprotective treatments on neurodegenerative, neuroinflammatory and functional outcomes using in vivo imaging to longitudinally monitor brain damage with corroborative histology, 24 h video electroencephalography to quantify recurrent seizures, and behavioral assessments of cognitive, affective and motor function. Our goals are to: (1) obtain neuroprotection data to support the advance of our antiseizure lead allopregnanolone; (2) obtain proof-of-concept neuroprotective efficacy data for perampanel alone or in combination with allopregnanolone; and (3) identify neuroprotectant leads, with an initial focus on our most promising candidate compounds: sEHI, the dual sEH-COX-2 inhibitor and dantrolene. We will continue testing additional antiseizure candidates identified by Project 2 and novel neuroprotective treatments identified in Project 1 using in vitro models. Superior neuroprotective treatments identified in this project will be tested by Project 2 to assess whether they interact with antiseizure treatments. Results from this project will support transition of allopregnanolone to advanced development and assess whether perampanel, other candidate antiseizure treatments, or candidate neuroprotective treatments, should become development leads."
"9311299","PROJECT SUMMARY - VDDRC PRECLINICAL MODELS OF DIGESTIVE DISEASES CORE The main objectives of the Preclinical Models of Digestive Diseases Core are to provide VDDRC investigators with access to non-invasive small animal imaging, organoid models, state-of-the art research immunohistochemistry, consultative services in interpretation of morphologic findings in animal models and human digestive diseases, construction of Tissue arrays, and laser capture microdissection (LCM). The Core has three components: the Preclinical Imaging Subcore, the GI Organoid Subcore and the Tissue Morphology Subcore. The expansion and modification of this Core now provides VDDRC investigators the opportunity to move nimbly from investigations utilizing non-invasive molecular imaging (Preclinical Imaging Subcore) and histology (Tissue Morphology Subcore), often in tandem, in tractable transgenic model systems of digestive diseases to mechanistic studies using novel organoid culture-based systems (GI Organoid Subcore). Fifty-one VDDRC members utilized services provided by this Core in the last funding period. Ex vivo studies that employ organoids will subsequently inform and guide new in vivo experimentation which will ultimately culminate in studies of clinical populations. Continually expanded services include access to a variety of molecular imaging probes specifically tailored for imaging GI disease in preclinical animal models, including NIR-based optical imaging reagents and translational imaging compounds labeled with positron emitting isotopes (PET). The Preclinical Imaging Subcore will support all major small animal imaging modalities including optical, SPECT, and PET methods for molecular imaging, as provided by the Center for Small Animal Imaging within the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science. The GI Organoid Subcore provides a unique service in promoting organoid production from both transgenic mouse models and human GI tissues. The Tissue Morphology Subcore provides research immunohistochemistry services for both human and animal intestinal tissue, construction of TMAs, and access to LCM. In addition, Dr. Washington, the Core Director, provides the necessary expertise for interpretation of the histologic findings obtained in these studies."

"9379001","Abstract Fam20C is the archetypical member of a unique family of secretory pathway kinases and is critical for many cellular processes including proper biomineralization of bones and teeth and regulation of kidney phosphate metabolism. Inactivating mutations in Fam20C cause Raine Syndrome, a severe osteosclerotic bone dysplasia that presents as abnormal hardening of bones, microcephaly, and gum hyperplasia. Fam20C phosphorylates secretory/extracellular proteins within a highly conserved Ser-x-Glu/pSer motif. We have recently discovered that Fam20C kinase activity is allosterically regulated via formation of a protein complex with a closely related member of the Fam20 family, Fam20A. Inactivating Fam20A mutations also cause severe tooth enamel defects in the disorder Amelogenesis Imperfecta, suggesting that both Fam20C and Fam20A are critical for proper biomineralization. We have queried the secreted phosphoproteome from several cell types and found that Fam20C is responsible for generating the vast majority (>90%) of secretory phosphoproteins. The secreted phosphoproteome is highly cell-type specific and the biological functions of Fam20C phosphorylation within most of these proteins are unclear. Many of the Fam20C substrates that we have identified are components of the extracellular matrix, and loss of Fam20C function exerts profound effects on cellular adhesion, migration, and invasiveness. Together, our preliminary data suggest that Fam20C- dependent phosphorylation plays critical roles in processes extending far beyond biomineralization to other diverse functions such as regulation of the extracellular matrix, wound healing, and lipid homeostasis. Because little is known about the role of specific Fam20C phosphorylation events within target substrates, our findings highlight the importance of understanding how Fam20C is regulated and of clarifying the physiological impact of Fam20C phosphorylation of specific substrates. This proposal will focus on defining the regulation of Fam20C by Fam20A and determining the role of Fam20C phosphorylation sites within extracellular matrix proteins."
"9308401","PROJECT SUMMARY Hypercalciuria occurs in 5-10% of the population and is the most common cause of calcium (Ca) kidney stone disease. Ca reabsorption takes place in different nephron segments; however, evidence from human subjects indicates that proximal tubule Ca reabsorption is decreased in stone formers. Furthermore, studies in both animals and humans suggest that increased proximal tubule Ca reabsorption accounts for the hypocalciuric effect of thiazide diuretics, the first line medication for hypercalciuria. Compared to Ca reabsorption in the distal tubule, much less is known about the mechanism of Ca reabsorption in the proximal tubule. Lines of evidence from classical physiological studies indicate the existence of an active Ca transport pathway in the proximal straight tubule, the last portion of the proximal tubule where Ca can be reabsorbed before tubular fluid enters the loop of Henle where supersaturation of Ca phosphate may occur due to water extraction. Active Ca reabsorption in this segment of the nephron may remove Ca in the tubular fluid to a level below that in the plasma. The objective of this proposal is to elucidate the roles of a novel active Ca transport pathway in the proximal straight tubule in causing and treating hypercalciuria. The central hypothesis is that active Ca reabsorption in the proximal tubule is disrupted by postprandial insulin surge and under hyperinsulinemia and is enhanced by thiazides. In addition, a Ca channel in the apical side of proximal straight tubule may act as a Ca sensor to regulate overall Ca homeostasis. It has been shown that postprandial insulin secretion and Ca excretion are both increased in hypercalciuric stone formers. Our preliminary studies indicate that TRPV6, a key Ca channel in the transcellular Ca transport pathway, is distributed to the proximal straight tubule, and TRPV6 activity is inhibited by insulin, and the hypocalciuric effect of hydrochlorothiazide is significantly reduced in TRPV6 null mice. These observations support our hypothesis, which implies that inhibition of TRPV6 by insulin contributes to postprandial hypercalciuria and hypercalciuria due to compensatory hyperinsulinemia as a result of insulin resistance. We will test our hypothesis and achieve our research objective by pursuing the following specific aims. 1. Determine the inhibitory effect of insulin on active Ca reabsorption in the proximal tubule. 2. Determine to what extent TRPV6 mediates the hypocalciuric effect of thiazides. 3. Determine the Ca-sensor roles of TRPV6 in the proximal straight tubule that regulate vitamin D synthesis and paracellular Ca transport. Approaches ranging from Ca influx in human proximal tubule cells to metabolic studies using TRPV6 null mice will be employed to accomplish our research goals. Upon successful completion of the proposed research, we expect to unveil the molecular mechanism for the active Ca reabsorption in the proximal tubule that regulates Ca reabsorption and Ca homeostasis. The inhibition of the active Ca reabsorption by insulin provides a molecular basis for the postprandial hypercalciuria in many stone formers and elevated Ca excretion in prediabetes. These outcomes will help to develop a new strategy to prevent hypercalciuria and kidney stone disease."
"9385574","Project Summary While HCT offers potentially curative therapy to patients with a variety of benign and malignant diseases, both acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) continue to plague the field and often limit the longevity and quality of life of our patients. While either bone marrow (BM) or mobilized peripheral blood (MPB) are suitable sources of donor hematopoietic cells, this network established in BMT CTN 0201 that granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) MPB is associated with a higher risk of chronic GVHD (cGVHD) and worse quality of life following unrelated donor HCT compared to BM. Similar results have been demonstrated in recipients of MPB from matched siblings. The Ohio State Blood and Marrow Transplant Research Consortium (OSUBMT- RC) is comprised of five highly experienced transplant centers with a well-established track record of productivity conducting clinical trials. Our consortium proposes a novel approach to limiting GVHD following HCT by establishing a new standard for the procurement of donor hematopoietic cells for transplantation. The OSUBMT- RC PI has pioneered a novel method to procure donor cells for HCT using the CXCR4 antagonist plerixafor without G-CSF. Plerixafor mobilizes CD34+ cells and other immune cells for transplantation far more rapidly than G-CSF (1 vs 5 days), with less toxicity to the donor. Grafts procured following plerixafor alone (P-MPB) promote full engraftment and based on a recent multi-center phase II study led by the PI, appear to reconstitute immunity faster than G-MPB and may cause less chronic GVHD (cGVHD). These advantages appear to be particularly striking in older patients receiving reduced intensity allografts. Based on these data, we hypothesize that P-MPB will become a suitable and possibly preferable alternative method to procure MPB for HCT due to the combination of better convenience and less toxicity for donors and less GVHD combined with better immune reconstitution in recipients. We propose to test these hypotheses with the following specific aims: Aim 1: We will conduct a randomized Phase II study of P-MPB versus G-MPB in recipients of matched sibling donor allografts with cGVHD-free, relapse free survival as the primary endpoint. Aim 2: We will test the hypothesis that immune reconstitution is improved with P-MPB versus G-MPB through correlative phenotypical, functional, and gene sequence based studies of T, B, NK, and dendritic cells procured from allograft recipients following HCT The proposed study addresses several key priorities of the BMT CTN established at the 2014 State of the Science Symposium and if promising will pave the way for a future definitive Phase III trial that could radically improve our process for collecting allografts from donors."
"9385258","Project Summary Acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA) is a rare bone marrow failure disorder with an estimated annual incidence of 2 per million in North America (just over 600 new diagnoses in the United States each year). The large majority of cases may be caused by autoimmune destruction of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs); accordingly SAA can be treated and often cured by either immune suppression therapy (IST) or marrow replacement through hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT). HCT from a human leukocyte antigen (HLA) matched sibling donor (MSD) is considered the standard for initial therapy of younger, newly diagnosed patients with long-term survival rates of up to 95-100% in patients under 20. However, only 18-20% of patients will have matched sibling donors, consequently, the large majority of patients receive IST for initial therapy. We propose a phase II trial comparing up front matched unrelated donor (URD) HCT with IST for children and very young adults with SAA. The primary endpointwould be proportion of patients alive at 2 years and immune suppression free with adequate counts. We have an open and accruing pilot study that is assessing key feasibility issues with the clinical design including acceptance of randomization, timely acquisition of donors, and safety of HCT. In addition, the pilot is testing the feasibility of acquiring, shipping and processing key biological specimens obtained from patients located at institutions across the country that will allow us in the future to elucidate the immunologic phenotype and genomic landscape of the marrow, and to understand the mechanisms of response and toxicity. Success of this pilot study and the phase III trial proposed in this BMT CTN renewal application is strengthened by a joint effort between two strong, established consortia: the North American Pediatric Aplastic Anemia Consortium (NAPAAC) and the Pediatric Blood and Marrow Transplant Consortium (PBMTC). If successful, this phase III trial will improve short-term immune suppression free and long- term overall survival and quality of life in young patients with SAA."
"9319035","Summary  The goal of the Integrated Kidney Function Core is to provide a wide range of services and to support the research projects of each PI of the Program Project Group. The progress in molecular genetics has greatly broadened our understanding of renal physiology and pathophysiology. Genetically altered animals provide elegant models to examine the contributions of individual proteins to the maintenance of normal function and pathophysiology of disease. Genetically modified animals are widely used as a powerful tools with which to characterize the physiological or pathphysiological roles of specific proteins, channels, pumps or transporters. These studies are important to understand the mechanisms of diseases and to look for novel targets for the treatment of clinical diseases. However, due to technical difficulties the characterization of knockout and transgenic mouse models has been largely limited to blood and urine electrolyte measurements. We are able to examine complete renal functions in vitro and in vivo, from whole animals to single nephrons, by renal clearance analysis and by microperfusion of renal tubules from rat or mouse. Using these methods, we are able to measure salt, water and acid-base transport as well as protein absorption in the kidney. Comparisons between normal vs. genetically modified animals in which a specific protein, channel or transporter is altered will provide invaluable information on physiology, pathophysiology and adaptation to diseases. The Integrated Kidney Function Core has played a uniquely important role in renal physiology research by supporting many research projects in the Program Project Grant. This core is staffed by well trained people who are skilled in all techniques needed to assess renal transport functions from the whole animal to the single nephron levels. Services and collaborations provided from this core lab provide each PI in the program project with tools that will allow them to connect their cellular and molecular observations to physiological and pathophysiological processes. To facilitate the overall goal of the Program Project, we plan to provide the following specific services as proposed in the projects: 1. To examine and compare the phenotypes of Na+, K+ Ca2+ and Mg2+ transport observed in ROMK and WNK4 (PHAII) mutant mice to those obtained from KLHL3 and CUL3 mutant mice (Project #1); 2. To measure both net Cl- transport and cellular Cl- concentrations under low and high tubular flow rates to study the physiological role of NKCC1 in the regulation of collecting tubule K+ transport (Project # 2); 3. To examine physiological inhibition (By PTH, dopamine) or stimulation (by Ang II, glucocorticoid) of NHE3 activity in response to NHE3 phosphorylation at sites that correlate with increased or reduced NHE3 activities (Project #3); and 4. To study electrolyte transport and the effects of ischemic injury in animal models manifesting altered AMPK expression (Project #4)."
"9323180","PROJECT 2. LATE TREATMENT ABSTRACT: Blood and Tissues Reservoirs Most human studies have characterized circulating reservoirs and some non-blood HIV reservoirs using limited biological samples from otherwise healthy HIV-infected individuals, like genital sections, gut biopsies and cerebrospinal fluid, or autopsy specimens with little pre-mortem characterization. Therefore, our understanding of how HIV populates tissues throughout the body and how these populations are associated with each other- remains limited. Our proposed Revealing Reservoirs during Rebound (R3) program will take the next steps in finding a cure for HIV by understanding how HIV persists in and populates reservoirs throughout the body. Specifically, the Late Treatment Research Project (RP) will maximize data and samples collected from a `Last Gift' cohort of HIV-infected terminally-ill individuals. These altruistic individuals will provide: (i) detailed clinical, risk and socio-demographic information before their death; (ii) weekly blood collections while they are alive, before and after voluntarily stopping ART and, (iii) their entire bodies after they die. This cohort will allow us to characterize the HIV populations in blood before ART is stopped and during rebound viremia, and throughout the body after death. To complement studies proposed in the Early Treatment RP, this RP will determine: Aim 1: Virologic and immunologic quantities measured during ART that predict dynamics of viral rebound dynamics when ART is stopped (timing, size, slope); Aim 2: Dynamics of HIV variants populating CD4+ T cell subsets and in various anatomic tissues after ART interruption. Aim 3: Determine immunologic mechanisms associated with HIV persistence during ART and after ART interruption. By investigating HIV-infected individuals who started ART during chronic infection and thus have larger HIV reservoirs and more immune damage from HIV, the Late Treatment RP will complement the Early Treatment RP, which will investigate persons who started ART during acute and early infection, and thus have smaller HIV reservoirs and more intact immune systems. This RP will also create new knowledge about how HIV resides in circulating CD4+ T cells and in anatomic tissues, and these data will be analyzed in conjunction with data from the Early Treatment RP vianew analytical methods with the Quantitative Methods RP to more fully understand HIV dynamics throughout the body."
"9476396","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) results in chronic inflammation of the lung and other tissues, which is difficult to treat with current tuberculosis (TB) drugs. The challenge to effectively curing patients with active TB is due to the persistence of drug-tolerant bacilli sequestered in granulomas with caseous necrosis or cavitation. Existing treatment regimes that are often complicated by toxic side effects consist of months or years of combination antimicrobial drugs, which are deemed necessary to effectively eradicate drug-tolerant bacilli. We propose a novel TB treatment strategy, targeting drug-tolerant Mtb using a class of small molecular weight, anti-biofilm compounds to be combined with conventional TB drugs. This strategy could significantly improve the efficacy of current TB drug therapy by more rapidly eradicating, persistent, drug-tolerant bacilli. Our in vitr and in vivo data show that Mtb forms extracellular, biofilm-like microbial communities as a strategy to survive TB drug therapy. From studying the Guinea pig TB model we determined that these drug-tolerant bacilli adopt the biofilm-like mode of existence when associated with lysed or necrotic leukocytes. To mimic this unique in vivo microenvironment we developed a novel in vitro assay in which extracellular, biofilm-like communities of Mtb are cultured on an attachment matrix derived from lysed human leukocytes. Similar to what is seen in vivo, our data show that Mtb expresses extreme in vitro drug tolerance, which is reversed by anti-biofilm drugs, rendering bacilli again susceptible to TB drugs. Our data show that these novel compounds disperse or inhibit the formation of biofilms formed by a variety of bacteria including M. smegmatis and increases the susceptibility of Mtb to isoniazid. The effectiveness of this strategy will be further tested using our in vitro Mtb drug tolerance assay to show 1) anti-biofilm compounds disperse and inhibit the formation of Mtb biofilm-like communities in vitro and 2) that combining anti-biofilm compounds with TB drugs effectively eradicates drug-tolerant Mtb associated with host-derived macromolecules. We will then determine whether combining anti-biofilm and TB drugs in the Guinea pig Mtb infection model is more effective at eliminating drug- tolerant Mtb than TB or biofilm drugs alone. In a series of mechanistic studies, we will use biotinylated, anti- biofilm compounds as molecular probes to identify Mtb specific virulence factors unique to the drug-tolerant phenotype. By determining the identity of Mtb adhesins or protein intermediates of metabolic pathways unique to drug-tolerant Mtb, additional compounds will be designed, synthesized and tested for biological activity. Successful completion of these highly innovative, translational studies will establish the feasibility of using anti- biofilm compounds as adjunct therapy to treat chronic Mtb in conjunction with existing TB drugs. We will also determine if anti-biofilm compounds combined with TB drugs are more effective at targeting drug-tolerant bacilli compared to TB drugs alone. Finally, we will reveal the mechanisms of action of our current anti-biofilm compounds and the identity of other druggable targets unique to drug-tolerant Mtb."

In the first aim ?to develop an integrated service structure for studies on gene sequence and function,? the Core integrates a comprehensive portfolio of services into one operational unit with a shared leadership of laboratories that provide gene-based assays and expert bioinformaticians. This structure facilitates consultation and service requests by DHC investigators. In the second aim ?to perform high-throughput gene expression and sequence assays,? the Core makes available to DHC investigators streamlined service lines that include state-of-the-art technology for gene expression (RNAseq and single-cell sequencing) and for sequence-based analysis of gene sequence and function (SNPs, DNAseq, ChIPseq, ExomeSeq, etc). In the third aim ?to provide bioinformatics consultation and analysis for genetics and genomics studies,? the Core gives members opportunities for the optimization of experimental design, technology selection, statistical analysis, and functional annotation of the large datasets produced by the Gene Expression and Sequence Laboratories. Bioinformaticians personalize analytical pipelines to meet the investigators' needs using powerful computing cluster environment and in a secured fashion by industry- quality firewall systems. And in the fourth aim to ?enable the validation of gene expression at the protein level,? the Core offers investigators the opportunity to validate at the protein level the expression of gene and gene groups using complementary assays in body fluids, cell surface, and intracellular environment. The service portfolio managed by the Gene Analysis Core has been highly subscribed by DHC investigators and has been linked to a high scientific output in peer-reviewed original publications that are relevant to digestive disease."
"9304796","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This K08 mentored career development application describes my four-year plan to complete my training as a physician scientist, combining practice in academic nephrology with an extramurally funded research program relevant to renal disease. More specifically, I propose to develop a research project and the skills necessary to become an independent investigator working in the field of kidney tissue engineering. Having completed an MD-PhD degree from NYU and internal medicine residency and nephrology fellowship at Yale, I maintain a strong desire to do research that impacts clinical problems. I am currently an Instructor in the Department of Internal Medicine at Yale. This K08 award would support the following goals: 1) to conduct renal tissue engineering research; 2) to develop expertise in tissue engineering and microfluidics; and 3) to develop an independent research career. End stage renal disease is a significant and costly problem best treated by kidney transplantation. However, there is a severe shortage of donor organs that could potentially be alleviated by tissue engineered kidney tissue. The functional unit of the kidney is called the nephron which has three primary components: 1) a blood supply 2) a filtration unit called a glomerulus and 3) a tubule to process the filtrate prior to excretion. Preliminary results demonstrated that implantation of endothelial cells with isolated renal glomeruli in vivo led to anastomoses and perfusion of microvessels and glomeruli. [The research proposed here seeks to further understand these anastomoses to significantly advance this renal tissue engineering strategy. Aim 1 is to investigate how glomeruli promote endothelial cell-glomerular anastomoses in vitro and in vivo. Knowledge derived from these studies may significantly improve the efficiency of anastomoses and ultimately glomerular survival and function. Aim 2 is to design a perfusable microfluidics device that supports the anastomoses and re-perfusion of glomeruli through microvascular networks in vitro. Microfluidics technology is featured prominently because I believe the ability to define the spatial relationships of the nephron structures will be necessary to incorporate tubular drainage of the perfused glomeruli in the future.] Key components of the career development plan include: 1) laboratory research driven by the research strategy described; 2) mentorship from a multidisciplinary group with expertise in vascular biology, tissue engineering, nephrology, and microfluidics; 3) participation in scientific conferences; 4) formal didactics in mathematics, microfluidics, and tissue engineering topics; and 5) supervised manuscript and grant submissions and instruction in responsible conduct of research. This career development plan will be carried out at Yale University, an outstanding environment that maintains an open, supportive community with state of the art facilities and a confluence of world-class researchers critical to the successful completion of this application."
"9327730","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Oncogene addiction, the phenomenon that inhibiting a single gene in a cancer cell can stop its proliferation, is a key motivation for pursuing targeted cancer therapy. However, a mechanism for how it is established and maintained is not known. There is a critical need to develop a systems-level understanding of how oncogene addiction is established and maintained. Not meeting this need would hinder efforts toward the rational discovery of targeted cancer therapeutics. The long-term goal of this research is to understand the molecular basis and systems-level logic of cancer development, maintenance, and therapeutic resistance, and to translate this understanding into targeted and durable cancer treatments. The overall objective of this project, which is the next step toward that goal, is to identify the molecular mechanism and systems-level logic of how addiction to a model oncogene, v-erbB, is established and maintained. The central hypothesis is that establishing v-erbB addiction is a form of cell-fate induction and is mediated by positive feedback. The rationale for the proposed research is that once a systems-level understanding of v-erbB addiction is developed, it will form a framework for understanding of oncogene addiction in other cancers, and therefore may lead to novel strategies for drug discovery. The central hypothesis will be tested through these specific aims: (1) Use mass spectrometry to identify the pathways involved in the establishment and maintenance of v- erbB addiction; (2) Build a mathematical model in order to identify network motifs that are important for establishing and maintaining v-erbB addiction; and (3) Use fluorescence microscopy to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying the establishment and maintenance of v-erbB addiction. The results of these studies will be a significant contribution because they are expected to deepen our understanding of how cancer develops, how the logic of a cancer cell differs from a healthy one, and how to rewire or destroy a cancer cell."
"9488752","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal requests continued support for the Molecular Endocrinology Training Program (METP) at Vanderbilt University. Progress towards understanding and curing obesity, diabetes and many other diseases requires the training of the next generation of scientists with expertise in molecular endocrinology, the goal of this program. The METP comprises 30 faculty members in 6 basic science departments. Of this group 27 are established faculty with stable, well-funded programs and substantial training experience and 3 are new investigators; 5 of these preceptors are female, 1 is a minority and 1 is disabled. This preceptor group constitutes a unusually diverse and talented group of individuals whose work covers the spectrum of molecular endocrinology. These preceptors conduct research in the general areas of: 1) signal transduction 2) the hormonal regulation of gene expression, 3) metabolic regulation and 4) beta-cell development and function. The request for a steady state level of 8 predoctoral and 4 postdoctoral trainees is justified on the basis of the number, size and quality of the research programs directed by the preceptors and the Institutional commitment to continue the same level of trainee recruitment despite the tough economic climate. All METP trainees are appointed upon the advice of an Admissions Committee after being nominated by a preceptor. Postdoctoral trainees have a Ph.D. degree. Rigorous in depth research training is the focus of both the pre and postdoctoral training programs. However, the METP also ensures that all trainees receive a broad didactic education. Predoctoral training in the METP follows that received in the Interdisciplinary Graduate Program (IGP). The IGP recruits almost all predoctoral trainees in the biomedical sciences at Vanderbilt, provides a first  year core curriculum, safety training and formal evaluation and career counseling programs. This centralized recruitment has considerably increased the number and quality of predoctoral students that enter Vanderbilt. After four laboratory rotations predoctoral students choose a preceptor for their thesis project and compete for METP support. The IGP and METP have been very successful in promoting diversity and both provide ongoing training in the Responsible Conduct of Research. All METP trainees attend an annual METP Day retreat and the Vanderbilt Diabetes Center (VDC) seminar series where they meet with visiting scientists. In conjunction with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation the METP has recently initiated a novel strategy to increase the recruitment of disabled individuals, specifically undergraduates with type 1 diabetes, through the creation of a VDC funded Summer Diabetes Research Program. The METP has already successfully trained 153 scientists of whom 54 have already gone onto assume academic/pharmaceutical positions with another 34 trainees still in training."
"9389857","Project Summary: The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand how skin stem cells maintain their identity when responding to cell intrinsic and extrinsic signals for self-renewal or differentiation. Self-renewal of stem cells is achieved by either symmetrical or asymmetrical cell division, through which new generations of stem cells are produced to replenish the stem cell population. However, DNA replication and cell division of adult stem cells can also lead to generation and accumulation of DNA mutations that compromise stem cell function and, in some cases, tumorigenesis. In the skin, hair follicle stem cells acquire quiescence to minimize cell turnover and division. However, it remains poorly understood how these stem cells transition between self-renewing and quiescent phases and the requirement of quiescence for long-term maintenance of stem cells. These questions have challenged investigators, because these self-renewing and quiescent stem cells are rare and usually heterogeneous in most adult tissues, making their isolation and characterization difficulty. In the skin of early adult mice, hair follicle stem cells are highly synchronized for self-renewal and quiescence. This property makes hair follicle stem cells an ideal system to investigate this fundamental question in stem cell biology. Recently, we have identified a transcription factor, Foxc1, induced in self-renewing but not quiescent hair follicle stem cells and their niche to reinforce quiescence. This finding uncovers an adaptive response of quiescent stem cells to stem cell activation during self- renewal and illuminates a path to further investigate mechanisms that control cellular state transitions in adult stem cells. In this proposal, we will utilize our innovative genomic tools and mouse models to understand adaptive control of stem cell quiescence and self-renewal mediated by transcription factors. We will first determine how multiple transcription factors regulate stem cell quiescence by coordinating transcriptional control of common and unique targets. We will determine the requirement of quiescence for long-term maintenance of hair follicle stem cells (Aim 1). We will then investigate the differences in open chromatin between self-renewing and quiescent stem cells. We will examine how the BMP signaling is controlled by transcription factors (Aim 2). Finally, we will investigate the mechanism of club hair anchorage mediated by transcription factors (Aim 3). The knowledge gained from these studies will enhance our understanding of quiescence control in hair follicle stem cells."
"9468309","There is a fundamental lack of understanding in how the structure and architecture of a synthetic polymer influences recognition in biological systems. Furthermore, there is a disconnection between the properties of polymers in solution and the solid state with their relationships with biological systems. Understanding how the conformational dynamics of a synthetic polymer can enhance biological recognition will advance fields including targeted drug delivery, antimicrobial agents, and tissue engineering. However, gaining the knowledge required to address this fundamental gap first necessitates the capability to synthesize precision macromolecules and scaffolds through a biocompatible approach. The long-term goal of this project is to establish a modular polymerization technology, using organic photocatalysts, for 3D printing of scaffolds with precisely defined molecular, chemical, mechanical, and geometric properties targeting lung tissue restoration. The central hypothesis of this research program is that the ability to use our biocompatible photo- mediated polymerization technology for 3D printing of scaffolds with defined components over several different length scales will enable tuning the scaffold for nurturing tissue growth. The overall objective of this application is to advance our polymerization technology using organic photocatalysts to mediate a metal free atom transfer radical polymerization en route to realizing a stereospecfic radical polymerization through flow chemistry reaction engineering design. With the capability to synthesize functionally diverse stereoregular polymers, we will determine the effects of polymer tacticity on their antimicrobial activity and selectivity for bacteria and compatibility with mammalian cells. Through catalyst development and expansion of monomer scope, we will establish a photographic photolithography approach to write distinct 2 and 3D polymer patterns in chemical composition through monomer selection. Furthermore, our approach to connect polymers in solution to those in the solid state will investigate molecular brush copolymers as intermediate macromolecules that possess characteristics similar to both forms. We will introduce these molecular brush copolymers into biological systems to explore the differences between them and the discrete polymer chains from our concurrent cell studies. These findings will help resolve the essential structural features of polymers to yield efficient solid state scaffolds for tissue engineering. The innovation of this research is within the methodology built upon our group?s foundational and ongoing work of developing an organocatalyzed atom transfer radical polymerization, which promises to yield new materials for introduction in biomedical applications. The rationale for this research is that it brings forth new materials that are only accessible through the development of our polymerization technology, which will allow the design and synthesis of polymers that more efficiently mimic natural systems for enhanced biological recognition."

The Methods Core will provide support to the projects proposed in this application and to future pilot projects. The Methods Core also will develop new methodological approaches that support the center objectives of bringing together behavioral economics and implementation science to improve the use of evidence-based practice in mental health care. The Methods Core will be led by Drs. Buttenheim, Marcus, and Williams. The Methods Core will address three major challenges to advancing implementation science: lack of rigor in implementation strategy design, lack of specificity in the measurement of mechanisms, and inadequate statistical sophistication in testing mediation and moderation in multi-level models. The Methods Core will host three incubators ?design, measurement, and statistics ? to address these challenges. We propose the following aims for our Methods Core: (1) optimize the rigor of implementation strategy design; (2) strengthen measurement of mechanisms; (3) and develop novel approaches to testing mediating and moderating effects in multi-level models. The Methods Core also will provide operational support, disseminate methodological advances and center resources, and evaluate center research productivity and impact. The methodological advances to come out of the Methods Core will have a significant public health impact, consistent with NIMH priorities, by improving evidence-based practice mental health service delivery in community settings.        "
"9220737","Project Summary The Small Animal Imaging Core has been continuously funded by the CCSG since 2006. Small animals provide invaluable model systems in a broad range of disciplines in cancer research including cancer biology, genetics, immunology, stem cell biology, and experimental therapeutics. Effective utilization of these models often demands application of non-invasive imaging methodologies. These techniques allow for longitudinal studies of disease progression and response to therapy as well as providing unique information that is not accessible via other methodologies. The major impediment to the effective application of these methodologies is that the highly specialized instrumentation and diverse expertise necessary is generally beyond the reach of the individual PI. The Small Animal Imaging Core is the ACC's NCI-approved Shared Resource that provides state-of-the-art instrumentation and a renowned faculty and technical support staff with the expertise necessary to apply a broad range of imaging modalities to small animal models. Supported modalities include magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography, computed tomography, single photon emission computed tomography, ultrasound imaging and optical/bioluminescence imaging. The Core provides limited animal housing for rats and mice, allowing multiple imaging sessions to be performed on a particular animal over an extended period without risking infection of the general population of animals. Since the last renewal, the Core has been physically consolidated, increasing proximity to ACC members. The new space facilitates the efficient application of multiple modalities to a given cohort of animals. In 2013, Dr. James Delikatny was appointed Core Director while Dr. Stephen Pickup continues as the Technical Director. The Core has four sub- Cores led by faculty with extensive experience in applying the respective imaging modality to small animals and nearly half of the users of the Core are ACC members. During the reporting period (10/01/13-09/31/14), 63 investigators have used the Core, with 31 (49%) being ACC members with peer-reviewed funding."
"9288230","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Defining the treatment effects in clinical trials that collect multivariate outcome data longitudinally is a difficult and open problem. The problem is further complicated by the heterogeneity of data, outcome scales, missing data, and correlation within and between outcomes of the same subject. To address this problem, this project proposes to develop the multidimensional latent trait linear mixed model (MLTLMM), define the treatment effect, and build the necessary complexity of the model to incorporate the major components of the data that could lead to strong biases in treatment effect estimation. The overall objectives of this proposal are to: 1) develop a modeling framework for analyzing multivariate longitudinal data and build an increasingly more sophisticated class of models that account for known, and currently ignored, problems in the data; 2) provide fast inferential and statistically principled approaches to inference; 3) develop a class of sensitivity analysis approaches to modeling choices; 4) develop tools for personalized dynamic predictions to facilitate targeted treatments; 5) apply these methods to data from current clinical trials; and 6) develop and standardize the newly proposed approaches via professional software development and web deployment. Our methods of defining and estimating the overall treatment effects in multivariate longitudinal data address the critical need across trials of many medical conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease) with a similar data structure."
"9488161","Project Summary  The Specific Aim of this proposal is to test the feasibility of using vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) for treating asthma related airway constriction that is refractory to current treatments. There are approximately 25 million people with asthma in the US. About 15% percent of these asthma sufferers experience early and late phase severe asthmatic bronchoconstriction that is refractory to current medication. These patients account for more than half of health related asthma costs and the majority of its mortality. This patient population accounts for 4,700 emergency department visits per day, 1,200 hospitalizations per day, and more than 3,300 deaths annually. There is currently no treatment for people who suffer from uncontrolled asthma.  Other percutaneous devices have proven effective for blocking the early phase of asthma attacks that are refractory to current therapy in an ED setting; but there is currently no effective VNS device for outside of the ED setting. In addition, the efficacy of their device for blocking the later phase of the asthma response is unknown. The late phase occurs in 50% of individuals and may account for extended stand and returns to the ED. Our goal is to provide patients with VNS for on-demand treatment of both the early- and late-asthma responses in order to drastically improve quality of life, prevent death, and to obviate the need for visiting the ED.However, before evaluating our method in humans, we must first determine if VNS is effective for halting both the early and the late phase of asthma. In this Phase I study, we will achieve our Specific Aim by evaluating the efficacy of VNS for blocking both early and late asthma responses in an ovalbumin (OVA)- sensitized guinea pig model of asthma.  Guinea pigs are anesthetized with urethane (1.8 g/kg i.p.). Heart rate and blood pressure are measured via a carotid artery cannula. Both jugular veins are also cannulated for administration of drugs. The left vagus nerve will be isolated and immersed in a pool of mineral oil, and bipolar cuff electrode will be placed around the left cervical vagus. Animal's body temperature will be maintained at 37?C using a heating blanket. Animals are paralyzed with succinylcholine (10 ml/kg/min, i.v.) and ventilated (tidal volume 1 ml/100 g body weight at 100 breaths per minute) via a tracheal cannula (using a constant volume pump, Harvard Apparatus Co, South Natick, MA). Bronchoconstriction (measured as an increase in pulmonary inflation pressure (Ppi) via a pressure transducer on a sidearm of the tracheal cannula) will be measured at stated time intervals after ovalbumin inhalation.  Test of Feasibility: We must observe ? 35% (mean) reduction of max respiratory system resistance when OVA is combined with VNS in comparison to sham VNS. This value was chosen because it is both directly related to previously demonstrated pulmonary pressure change in guinea pigs and predictive of later clinically meaningful responses in humans."

"9354195","Abstract: Daily administration of high dose glucocorticoids is standard of care for the treatment of many pediatric inflammatory diseases, including Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) and Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD). The side effect profiles of these potent drugs in children can be severe, with stunting of growth, bone fragility, mood changes, and sleep disturbances among many others. It is rare for glucocorticoids to be approved and labeled for pediatric disorders where they are routinely being prescribed, despite these serious side effect profiles. Glucocorticoids were first approved for use in adult disorders in the 1950s, yet progress on discovery and development of the next generation drugs with significantly improved side effect profiles has been surprisingly slow. This has been attributed to the complexity of mechanisms of actions of glucocorticoids (both with regards to safety and efficacy), the growth in use of biologics for many pediatric diseases, and the lack of interest from the pharmaceutical industry given the pervasive use and low cost of traditional glucocorticoids. However, particularly in children, the decrease in quality of life and the increase in clinical care ?costs? caused by side effects of glucocorticoids are substantial, but have been poorly studied. This U54 RPDP application is from an established group with expertise in pediatric pharmacology (inclusive of a newly funded NICHD T32 in clinical pediatric pharmacology), pediatric drug development, and chronic inflammatory diseases in children. In this application, we focus on pediatric inflammatory disorders, using two disease exemplars, DMD and IBD, as these may prove to be great representatives of chronic pediatric diseases treated with glucocorticoids. The team at the Children?s National Health System (CNHS) has partnered with an innovative venture philanthropy company, ReveraGen BioPharma, to bridge pharmacodynamic biomarkers to clinical outcomes in the pediatric population. In preliminary data presented in longitudinal studies of both IBD and DMD, we describe validated panels of pharmacodynamic biomarkers for both multiple aspects of safety, as well as anti-inflammatory efficacy. These pharmacodynamic safety and efficacy biomarkers are being used to evaluate a promising next generation anti-inflammatory steroid (VBP15/vamorolone). The goals of the proposed projects in this application are to bridge pharmacodynamic biomarkers to clinical outcomes for specific safety and efficacy aspects of both glucocorticoids (prednisone) and VBP15. This will set the stage for clinical trials of vamolorone and other anti-inflammatory drugs in pediatric inflammatory diseases, where the data obtained is expected to enable more acute and objective readouts of drug action in pediatric patients using well-characterized pharmacodynamic biomarkers as outcome measures."
"9209234","Abstract, Project 3 A premise of current research on vaccines for rapidly evolving pathogens (e.g., influenza virus and HIV) is that better understanding of molecular events during antibody affinity maturation can lead to more rational vaccine design. The goals of Project 3 are to interpret, in biophysical and structural terms, the findings from immunization studies with humans, non-human primates, and mice in Projects 1 and 2; to define, with quantitative experimental results, concepts such as immunodominance and epitopic distance; to provide molecular movies of specific affinity maturation trajectories; and to design new immunogens, as tests for the hypotheses explored and generated in the Program Project as a whole. We concentrate on antibodies that target the receptor-binding site (RBS). (1) We will generate a structural epitope map of the naïve response to a single HA subtype, to provide an epitope language for the rest of the project. We will then seek structural explanations for any heterosubtypic antibodies in the naïve response (human, macaque) to a multivalent vaccine. (2) Can we use a set of HAs with defined similarity at a particular epitope (epitopic distance) to determine the extent to which a primary exposure will dominate a subsequent, heterologous humoral response? We propose an operational definition of epitopic distance and outline experiments to test and modify it. We will relate epitopic distance to structural features, with the long-term goal of enabling computational estimates from knowledge of a single-Fab:single-HA-variant structure. This approach to the HA RBS, an extremely well characterized epitope, will establish benchmarks and concepts to apply more broadly to design of immunogens and vaccination regimens. (3) Building on (1) and (2), we will test directly and critically the concept of B-cell lineage-based immunogen design, while also testing the outcomes, in mice and macaques (Projects 2 and 1, respectively), of particular immunization protocols with particular designed immunogens."

"9353811","TR&D 3. Advanced Statistical Methods for Functional MRI.  Principle Investigators: James J. Pekar, PhD., Associate Professor of Radiology  Brian S. Caffo, Ph.D., Professor of Biostatistics SUMMARY The biological description of the brain as an evolved ensemble of distributed neural networks underlies the significance of applying imaging measures of functional connectivity to clinical research. Our collaborative projects use blood oxygenation level dependent functional MRI (BOLD fMRI) to assess changes in brain networks in autism, ADHD, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, primary progressive aphasia, and Huntington's disease, seeking to develop noninvasive imaging-based biomarkers in order to reveal disease mechanisms, improve diagnosis and prognosis, and assess therapeutic interventions. Their studies are limited by the sensitivity and specificity of BOLD fMRI acquisitions. The overarching goal of this TR&D is to work with our collaborators to enhance the sensitivity and specificity of their functional connectivity measures by developing novel empirical Bayesian analysis approaches that exploit two ongoing transformations that are dramatically improving the acquisition and availability of fMRI data, namely simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) MRI, and the availability of large public datasets. Accordingly, we have developed three specific aims: 1. To develop time-invariant approaches to autoregressive modeling, and optimize them for SMS fMRI data. 2. To develop time-invariant approaches to nuisance regression, and optimize them for SMS fMRI data. 3. To design, implement, and assess empirical Bayesian methods for combining information from large public databases with data obtained from single subject/small sample studies."

"9354202","Abstract: Trials in pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) (Crohn?s disease [CD] and ulcerative colitis [UC]) are challenging because of the lack of validated patient-reported outcome measures and non-invasive biomarkers of disease response, as well as poor correlation between symptoms and objective measures of inflammation. Vamorolone is a novel dissociative glucocorticoid which offers significant safety benefits for children with IBD, particularly the lack of steroid-associated effects on growth and bone mineral density, side effects of which children with IBD are particularly vulnerable. Within the context of planning a short-term phase 2 trial design of vamorolone in the treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis (UC) (Aim 4), we are exploring the use of non-invasive pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarkers that may be bridged to both safety and efficacy outcomes. The short-term treatment course and relatively quick symptom response to steroids experienced by patients with IBD allows for correlation of symptom response with changes in serum proteins. In addition, the objective endpoint of endoscopic assessment of inflammation (visually and histologically), expected not with GCs but with anti-TNF therapy, is a critical outcome to be bridged to changes in efficacy PD biomarkers, which may be seen acutely (predictive) or after a longer treatment course (reflective of a target endpoint). To generate a cohort of candidate serum efficacy biomarkers that may be correlated with symptom-based and objective clinical outcomes related to reduction of inflammation, we used a SomaScan? aptamer-based proteomic discovery platform to identify proteins that are elevated at baseline, and decrease across both GC and anti-TNF treatment groups. In Project 2, we aim to collect serum and mucosal biopsies samples to correlate novel candidate efficacy PD biomarkers with clear symptom-based and objective measures of disease activity in UC and CD. As supportive data for Project 2, we also demonstrated an increase in serum proteins among IBD patients treated with GCs that mirror those safety biomarkers increased by longer-term GC treatment of children with another inflammatory disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). If GC-specific safety biomarkers are to be used in clinical trials of vamorolone in pediatric UC, their increased acute expression must be correlated with physical findings reflecting side effects associated with GC, as has been accomplished in studies of DMD (Project 1). The development of outcome- bridged efficacy PD biomarkers would improve clinical patient care for children with UC and Crohn?s disease (CD) by providing early evidence of physiologic response, alleviating the need to blindly wait-and-see if the patient will respond before altering therapy. PD safety and efficacy biomarkers would also support clinical trials of vamorolone, and other novel anti-inflammatory therapies. PD markers and patient-reported outcome measures may prove ideal co-endpoints for IBD trials, reducing costs and complications associated with endoscopy, and supporting extrapolation of data between patient cohorts."
"9280024","Driving Biomedical Projects Project Summary/Abstract We have identified thirteen driving biomedical projects for the National Resource for Advanced NMR Technology BTRR. These projects are led by PIs who are leaders in NMR technology development in their own regard and who are at the forefront of new and exciting biomedical research applications. This ensures that they will actively participate in technology development, experimental design, and developing data collection and analysis strategies. They will also provide immediate and insightful feedback on technology performance. For the DBPs we have three specific aims: 1) Demonstrate capabilities and provide evaluation for ultrasensitive cryoprobe technologies developed by TR&D1; 2) Demonstrate capabilities and provide evaluation for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) technologies developed by TR&D2; and 3) Demonstrate capabilities and provide evaluation for series connected hybrid (SCH) magnet technologies developed by TR&D3. Many of the DBPs will be actively involved with two or even three of the TR&D projects. This wide ranging engagement fosters the proliferation of ideas and techniques between the various projects. The DBPs are characterized by research that is at the forefront of the NMR field in developing new techniques and applying them to extremely challenging biomedical research problems. Many of them have the most advanced commercial NMR technology available at their home institutions, and are pushing the boundaries of sensitivity and resolution with creative approaches to NMR pulse sequences, sample preparation strategies, and data processing and analysis. They are all keenly aware of the need for improved capabilities, particularly through implementing higher magnetic fields, developing the highest sensitivity probes possible, and pursuing dynamic nuclear polarization as an orthogonal strategy to improve sensitivity. We have long standing relationships with many of the DBP contributors, as collaborators and users of the NHMFL facilities ensuring lively and productive dialogue. We view the collection of DBPs we have assembled as the best suited to push devel- opment of the TR&D's with biomedical research programs in five primary areas of interest to the NIH: intrinsi- cally disordered proteins, membrane proteins, protein assemblies, enzyme mechanisms and metabolomics. Collectively, the technology developments proposed through the TR&Ds are paramount to advancing the sensitivity and resolution needed to address vanguard biomedical questions posed by the DBPs, and through the guidance of the DBPs we will pioneer the next step in NMR technology."

"9299029","PROJECT SUMMARY A critical task of childhood is acquiring a set of concepts to organize information efficiently, guide inductive inferences, and serve as building blocks for larger systems of knowledge. This process is powerfully social and interactive, permitting humans to pass down important discoveries and ideas from one generation to the next. Children are exquisitely sensitive to language testimony and statistical features of the input to guide learning. There is thus a great need to supplement experimental, lab-based studies with observational data on parent- child conversations. Gathering and analyzing such data sets requires extensive investments of time and effort; thus it would benefit the field for individual researchers who have gathered such data sets to make them available to other researchers. The goal of this research project is to archive, document, and make publicly available 11 existing data sets of parent-child conversations for use by the broader research community. The data sets were supported by two NICHD grants to S. Gelman (HD23378 and HD36043), including 1,034 participants and over 180,000 utterances, with typically developing children ranging in age 1.5 to 7 years and their parents. These data sets are innovative in several respects: (a) They provide parent-child conversations regarding concepts and categories for a large sample of children within an understudied age range. (b) A quasi-naturalistic method was employed, in which parents and children conversed freely, but the stimuli and contexts were standardized. This approach has the advantage of providing dense sampling of topics of interest (e.g., categorization) and control over factors such as item frequency, familiarity, and salience. (c) The data sets are particularly innovative in their inclusion of two understudied languages, Marathi (an Indo-Aryan language) and Southern Quechua (an endangered indigenous language spoken in Peru and Bolivia). Distribution will be via the Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES), which provides sophisticated search and analytic tools. These rich datasets will permit important secondary analyses investigating competing models of concept learning and representation, and characterizing the learning environment in depth. The data will also permit establishing norms regarding typically developing use of language to talk about abstractions, which have been found to be impaired in children with ASD and SLI. Thus our specific aims are: Aim 1: To archive, document, and make publicly available (in the CHILDES database) 11 data sets of parent-  child conversational interactions that were collected with NICHD support. Aim 2: To enable researchers to conduct secondary analyses on these data, in order to address research  questions regarding concepts, categories, language development, and parental input. Aim 3: To provide full documentation of the stimuli created for these data sets (pretested, standardized,  researcher-created picture books) for future researchers who wish to conduct extensions of these projects  in different languages, different socioeconomic and cultural contexts, or different populations."
"9359533","During the last funding cycle, the PPG made significant advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of stone formation and growth. Project 3 has made a comprehensive and essential histopathological characterization of the papillae in human stone disease, and distinguished two main phenotypes that are essential to the pathogenesis of stone disease: plaque deposition and intratubular crystal plugging. A grasp of the contribution of each of these phenotypes to the type of stone disease is essential to understand the underlying pathology, and eventually developing targeted therapies. Achieving this objective requires the performance of unprecedented, detailed, studies of the various microenvironments within the human papillae of stone forming patients. The aims in the current proposal are designed to perform such in-depth investigations of the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying these key events, using state-of-the-art methodology and skills of the research team. The role of interstitial calcium concentration in the formation of plaque is a fundamental concept. Aim 1 will firmly establish the importance of increased interstitial calcium in the papilla on the pathogenesis of plaque. Aim 2 will investigate the role of innate immune activation in plaque formation. Key downstream effects of innate immunity, such as oxidative stress, inflammatory signaling and crystal modulator deposition will be carefully studied. This aim is expected to define with high confidence, the role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of plaque deposition in human stone disease. Aim 3 will investigate a key mechanism of how plugging disease propagates in the papilla, by determining if ducts with plugs can stimulate oxidative stress and inflammatory signaling beyond the area contiguous to plugging. This cross -talk could lead to upregulation of adhesion molecules that facilitate more plugging in neighboring ducts. Finally, Aim 4 will investigate the rarely-studied papillary urothelium, by establishing if overgrowth of new stones over plaque is preceded by dysfunction of the overlying papillary urothelium. Methods used in these investigations will include: laser micro-dissection, 3 dimensional imaging of the papillae using confocal microscopy, tissue cytometry, state-of the art protein analysis and redox proteomic assays. Combined together, and in synergy with aims from project 1 and 2, these new aims, will greatly advance our understanding of the precise mechanisms of stone formation and growth, which will hopefully translate into more effective clinical treatments for stone disease."
"9296168","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): More than 30 years into the AIDS epidemic, men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to engage in unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) in circumstances in which there is risk of HIV transmission. MSM are the only CDC-defined risk group in the US in which new HIV infections have been increasing steadily since the 1990s. Statistics about HIV among male-to-female transgender women (TGW) are often unavailable but it is known that HIV prevalence in this population is high, and the 2011 Institute of Medicine Consensus Report called for much needed research among transgender populations. Alternatives to condom use are needed for individuals who cannot or will not use condoms. Use of a rapid HIV-home test (HT) to screen potential sexual partners could be an important risk-reduction tool for such population. The primary aim of our study is to determine if high-risk MSM and TGW who have access to HT and learn how to use it with potential sexual partners engage in less sexual risk behavior than MSM and TGW who do not use HT. The secondary aim of the study is to determine if ease of access to HT affects its use to reduce occasions of UAI. This 5-year randomized controlled trial will target mainly, but not exclusively, ethnic minority men and TGW who have sex with men, are HIV-uninfected and non-monogamous, never or seldom use condoms, and have a history of serodiscordant UAI. We will recruit and pre-screen approximately 600 participants in two cities with high HIV prevalence: New York, NY, and San Juan, PR. Given the stringent eligibility criteria of the study, we expect that only 300 participans will be eligible to enroll in the trial after screening at Visit 1. At Visit 2, they will be randomzed in equal numbers to one of two groups: Group A participants will receive an HT intervention orientating them to effective ways of using HT to screen sexual partners and will be supplied with HT kits to use with sexual partners over 6 months; Group B participants will receive neither the HT intervention nor supply of kits, and we will monitor whether they avail themselves of HT kits through purchase or other means. Both groups will receive risk-reduction counseling. All participants' behavior will be monitored for 6 months through daily brief SMS reports. At Visit 3 (6-month evaluation), we will test our primary hypothesis; also, we will discontinue the provision of HT to Group A. Group A will be monitored for three additional months. At Visit 4 (9-month evaluation), we will test our secondary hypothesis. Demonstrating that use of HT is an effective risk-reduction tool can have a high, transformative impact in the HIV prevention field. Additionally, demonstrating the crucial nature of easy access to HT to realizing the potential of HT as a risk-reduction tool may spur action to make HT more accessible to populations most likely to benefit from its use. It will give evidence that use of a biotechnology that is already available and less costly than others (e.g., PrEP) can potentially result in fewer new infections and reduce public health expenditures."
"9360098","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Project Summary A key goal of computational neuroscience is to discover how the brain?s structural organization produces its functional behavior, and how impairment of the former causes dysfunction and disease. Rapid advances in neural measurement technologies are finally beginning to enable in vivo measurements of large-scale functional organization (via EEG, MEG, fMRI, PET, optical imaging) and the underlying structural connectivity architecture (via diffusion MRI, tractography). Traditional non-linear numerical simulations of single neurons or local circuits is challenging to extrapolate to macroscopic brain dynamics, and deterministic brain network models are needed that can integrate across modalities and scales. We propose an ambitious multi-scale, parsimonious and analytic model of brain function based on spectral graph theory. Bayesian inference using graphical modeling is proposed to deduce structure from function. These algorithms will be implemented and shared via a Network Dynamics Workbench that can be used by neuroscientists and clinicians to perturb structure and generate hypotheses regarding functional impairment in stimulus and disease conditions. The key insight underlying this proposal is that the emergent macroscopic behavior of the brain is essentially deterministic, and is undergirded by network ?eigen-modes?. We will develop graph models of neural dynamics that are accessible analytically by simple equations rather than via numerical simulations. These models will be minimal and simple, and linear wherever appropriate. The final deliverable is a Network Dynamics Workbench for experimentally interrogating brain function and dysfunction. Relevance Neurological and psychiatric disorders constitute an overwhelming burden of disease today, especially in a rapidly aging population. A validated model of brain function predicted from structure will provide a critical tool in understanding and fighting these disorders."

"9526799","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application proposes the establishment of a Center for Research on the Ethical, Legal and Social Implications of Psychiatric, Neurologic and Behavioral (PNB) Genetics at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC). Since April 2010, we have been funded under a P20 Developing Center grant to create the infrastructure and begin development of such a Center. PNB genetics present particular ethical, legal and social challenges because of the highly stigmatized nature of many PNB disorders and traits; the potential impact of genetic predispositions for PNB disorders and traits on perceptions of responsibility for behavior; and the complex interactions between genetic propensities and environmental influences that determine the onset and course of many PNB disorders, rendering the implications of many PNB genetic data inherently ambiguous. Our new Center will promote thoughtful consideration of the range of issues arising in the context of PNB genetics and develop innovative approaches to addressing them. Specifically, we will undertake a focused program of research that explores the impact of PNB genetic information at the individual, familiar and societal levels, considering its effects on stigma and self-image, attributions of responsibility, and responses to ambiguity, along with systematic consideration of the broader normative and policy implications of our findings. To maximize the value of our research, we will create robust mechanisms to translate the empirical and normative output of our research into recommendations for policy and practice, capitalizing on the involvement of other experts and key stakeholder groups. With an eye on the future of ELSI studies, we will develop a multidisciplinary post-doctoral training program focused on nurturing future leaders in ELSI research, creating an environment that facilitates cross-disciplinary learning and research and draws on outstanding mentors and teachers. In sum, we will create a structure that builds on our existing strengths and accomplishments to enhance transdisciplinary collaboration, facilitate the conduct of innovative research, and foster intellectual growth among both faculty and trainees."
"9324982","Project Summary / Abstract ? Overall Metabolic disorders and their vascular complications are among the most pressing healthcare issues worldwide. The University of Michigan Medical School has strategically invested in both human and physical resources over the past 15 years under the umbrella of the Michigan Comprehensive Diabetes Center in a concerted attack on this problem. One component of the strategy has been to foster the development of core laboratories within the university to provide key expertise and specialized phenotyping services at reasonable cost to researchers throughout the institution. We now propose to coalesce a quartet of these phenotyping cores into the Michigan MMPC to continue providing comprehensive and state of the art services internally, while expanding their availability to researchers on a national level, and continuing the development of more sensitive and more specific tools to probe the pathogenesis and biochemical consequences of diabetes and obesity in mouse models. The Michigan MMPC will provide services in four major areas. The Metabolism, Bariatric Surgery and Behavior Core will perform a variety of in vivo physiological assessments encompassing glucose homeostasis (glucose tolerance, insulin tolerance, hyperinsulinemic/euglycemic clamps), energy homeostasis (indirect calorimetry by CLAMS, dietary challenge), ultradian hormone secretion (Culex platform for serial biological fluid sampling from unrestrained mice), behavioral measurements (locomotor activity, meal pattern analysis, operant conditioning) and generation of bariatric surgery models. The Cardiovascular Pathophysiology Core will assess cardiovascular function (exercise tolerance, blood pressure, ECG, telemetry, echocardiogram), offer mouse surgical models of cardiac ischemia and pressure overload and imaging using ultrasound. The Microvascular Complications Core will provide basic and advanced assessment of diabetes complications including neuropathy, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The Microbiome Core will provide anaerobic microbial culture, microbiome genomic and transcriptomic libraries, 16S ribosomal gene and RNA sequencing with associated bioinformatic analysis. Mouse importation, housing, veterinary care, clinical chemistry and histopathology services will be provided by the Animal Care Core. In addition, the latter core hosts a germ-free mouse facility and will interact with the Microbiome core to produce and distribute germ-free and gnotobiotic mouse models. The Administrative Core will manage all Center activities, oversee financial operations, provide training opportunities, and collaborate with the other phenotyping centers and the Central Coordinating and Bioinformatics Unit of the MMPC Consortium by providing all collected phenotyping data and protocols and participating in the Pilot and Feasibility award and MICROMouse funding programs. Together, our Core resources will provide in a single Center access to a broad range of advanced phenotyping capabilities, including our unique focus and expertise on microvascular complications, microbiome analysis and germ-free mice and bariatric surgery models."
"9296089","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is a renewal application for a 5-year continuation of the VITamin D and OmegA-3 TriaL (VITAL), which is evaluating the role of vitamin D and marine omega-3 fatty acid supplements in the primary prevention of cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evidence for a role of these agents in preventing cancer, CVD, and other diseases remains inconclusive regarding causality and insufficient to inform nutritional recommendations for primary prevention. Appropriately designed randomized trials in general populations are lacking. To fill this knowledge gap, we have been conducting VITAL, a highly innovative, cost-efficient, large-scale, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical tria among 26,000 U.S. men and women without cancer or CVD at baseline, who have been selected only on age (men aged e50 and women aged e55), with an oversampling of blacks (ne5000). In a 2x2 factorial design, participants have been randomized to vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol, 2000 IU/d) and marine omega-3 fatty acids (Omacor(R) fish oil, 1 g/d, containing eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA] + docosahexaenoic acid [DHA]) supplements (or placebos) independently. Contingent on continued funding, the median treatment period will be 5 years. During the first cycle, we have successfully met or surpassed our recruitment goals, enrolled a racially/ethnically diverse cohort, collected baseline blood/DNA samples on >16,000 participants (with plans for follow-up bloods in 6000), and conducted extensive validation studies of the laboratory assays for vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid measurements in the trial. Annual follow-up questionnaires assess treatment compliance (confirmed by blood samples in a subset of participants), side effects, endpoint occurrence, and cancer and vascular risk factors. Self-reported endpoints are confirmed by medical record review by physicians blinded to treatment assignment, and deaths are ascertained through the National Death Index-Plus and other sources. Our archived blood samples allow assessment of effect modification by baseline 25-hydroxyvitamin D and omega-3 fatty acid levels, changes in biomarkers over time, and testing of genetic/biochemical hypotheses. With our scientific colleagues, we have obtained funding for 18 ancillary studies to evaluate the role of these supplements in preventing other chronic diseases (including diabetes, cognitive decline, depression, and autoimmune disorders), and established an in-clinic component for in-depth phenotyping of a subcohort (n=1000). The trial is expected to provide either definitive positive or informative null results for our primary hypotheses and will serve as a national resource for research on the health effects of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids, with opportunities for extensive collaborations. This is a high-impact trial due to the potential for major clinical and public health implications of the findings."

"9357601","Project Summary/Abstract: The broad, long-term objective of this grant is to advance a graph theoretical framework to identify core-nodes in a Brain Network of Networks to develop a software tool that will allow end-users from the broad neuroscience community to identify and analyze the most influential nodes in the brain in various disease states. Specific Aim #1: Develop Network of Networks (NoN) graph theoretical tools to identify ?core nodes? for network vulnerability, which can be used as a tool to analyze disorders of the brain. The project will advance the theoretical models from a single network to multiple networks and will create a tool based on this theory to be used by other neuroscience researchers and clinicians. Specific Aim #2: Use the graph theoretical NoN analysis to understanding how patients with brain tumors are able to retain function in certain instances due to plasticity and the reorganization of functional networks. This grant will address a central problem in neuroscience: how plasticity allows the brain to recover function after an insult: specifically, how perturbations of the neural network (the growth of a tumor in the brain) affects the stability of the brain NoN and the ability of the network to avoid catastrophic collapse (how the brain adjusts and continues to function notwithstanding the presence of a brain tumor). Hypothesis 1: Involvement of core NoN nodes by tumor necrosis or Gd-enhancement leads to functional deficits, whereas involvement of core nodes by FLAIR abnormality leads to cortical reorganization and preservation of function. Hypothesis 2: Patients with preservation of language/motor function will have connectivity maps that are significantly different from patients with loss of neurological function and normal controls, including the development of core nodes, which is theorized to represent cortical reorganization. Hypothesis 3: The NoN method of analysis will be better able to discriminate loss of neurological function than other methods of analysis. Specific Aim #3 (Resource sharing plan): The software and tools developed as a result of this grant will be optimized for usability by neuroscience clinicians and researchers for non-profit users in the larger scientific community. Health relatedness and long term goals: The results of the present study should lead to improved planning of brain tumor surgery. Once completed, we trust that the tools developed by this project will be able to be used by the larger neuroscience community to study, diagnose and develop treatment strategies for other brain disorders thought to be due to disruptions of brain connectivity (e.g. Alzheimer's disease, ADHD, stokes or traumatic brain injury). The development and testing (in a clinical situation) of the theories of organization and responses to perturbations of brain networks should lead to the inference of general principles regarding network organization applicable to areas outside of the neurosciences."

"9312807","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The idiopathic nature of UCPPS has prompted an intense search for diagnostic and prognostic clinical biomarkers of this syndrome. The development of clinically relevant biomarkers of UCPPS is critical to effective clinical management and to the understanding of UCPPS pathology, and to the goal of advancing current treatment and developing novel therapies. During MAPP-I, we have taken advantage of the power of our interactive Trans-MAPP Network to successfully identify a panel of biologically-relevant, noninvasive urinary biomarkers of UCPPS using two distinct approaches: (1) a biologically-driven biomarker discovery strategy grounded in the basic biology and physiology of this disease and (2) a global proteomics biomarker discovery strategy. As members of the MAPP Biomarker Working Group, we exploited our own extensive experience in human sample repository development and biosampling, along with that of our colleagues, to develop the 'Best Practices' protocols that are currently being utilized for the acquisition, shipping and storage of all human samples in the MAPP network. Through our directed, biologically-driven studies, we have analyzed ~500 (to date) urine samples provided during MAPP-I for the presence and amounts of six different protein biomarkers identified as described above. In addition to the identification and validation of these individual protein biomarkers, we also found that (1) UCPPS significantly changes the urinary proteome as compared to that of healthy and positive controls and (2) UCPPS may alter the regulation of extracellular matrix proteins in a definable, biologically-relevant pattern. We are now in the process of completing the validation studies of those urinary proteins identified in our global proteomics work and intend to multiplex them with those discovered through our biologically-driven discovery studies. We will then combine our final validated panel of biomarkers with biologic and clinical data from other participating MAPP discovery sites. Multiplexing these markers will increase the predictive power of any of the markers alone. We will then test the ability of this panel of biomarkers to identify the presence o UCPPS, monitor response to therapy, predict disease progression and episodic flares, and confirm improvement and resolution, with or without intervention. Finally, we will ask what these validated diagnostic targets teach us about mechanism(s) underlying these different UCPPS disease stages. These goals will be met within the context of the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 To assess the utility of the identified and validated urinary biomarkers from Phase I in the clinical management of UCPPS Aim 2 To assess the clinical utility of multiplexing all biomarkers validated in our studies with biologic and clinical data identified and validated by other Trans-MAPP groups Aim 3 To elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying the presence of disease, disease flare, response to intervention and resolution"

"9414848","ABSTRACT The most significant development in HIV epidemiology is the increasing age in the infected population. Among HIV-associated comorbidities that have been related to aging, neurocognitive dysfunction and vascular disorders are particularly striking. The current proposal links both conditions together by focusing on the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and neurogenesis of neural progenitor cells (NPC). HIV infected brains are characterized by increased deposition of amyloid beta (A?), and we demonstrated in the previous funding cycle that the BBB (formed primarily by the endothelium of brain capillaries) actively participates in this process. The current proposal will explore the role of the brain endothelium-derived extracellular vesicles (ECV) in A? transfer to neural progenitor cells (NPC) and their impaired neurogenesis in HIV-infected brains. The proposed research is built on the notion that enhanced accumulation of A?, toxicity of anti-retroviral therapeutics, and residual viral replication in HIV-infected brain are driving the brain pathology resulting in neurocognitive decline. The central hypothesis of the proposal is that A? carried by ECV derived from the brain endothelium enhances HIV infection of NPC and impairs their differentiation into the neuronal lineage, resulting in neurocognitive decline. Specific mechanisms evaluated in this application include the impact of A? carried by the brain endothelium-derived ECV on HIV infection and the impaired neurogenesis of NPC (Aim 1), alterations of gap junction-mediated intercellular communication between infected and non-infected NPC (Aim 2), and (Aim 3) the contribution of anti-retroviral drugs to amyloid deposition and impaired neurogenesis of NPC in HIV-infected brain. Overall, the proposal offers a unique perspective on the interactions between the BBB and A? deposits in a HIV-infected brain, resulting in impaired NPC neurogenesis. We expect that the project will provide proof-of-principle for the involvement of A? in the development of cognitive dysfunction in HIV."
"9318113","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  We have recently demonstrated a connection between sensory nerves in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) and the aberrant bone formation known as heterotopic ossification (HO). From these studies bone morphogenetic protein type 2 (BMP2) appears to directly induce expression of neural inflammation, that leads to the expansion and migration of perineurial progenitors. These cells then undergo brown adipogenesis and suppression of neural inflammation, both ablated their expansion and significantly attenuate HO. Also of note, these brown adipocyte-like cells expressed many chondrocyte markers suggesting that they may be undergoing chondrogenesis. These perineurial progenitors also express VEGF A and D within 48 hours of induction of HO, which coincides with the appearance of new flk1+ vessels in the region of new bone formation. Simultaneously, other cells from the endoneurial compartment of the nerve were found to express the osteoblast transcription factor osterix. These cells also express claudin 5, which is present on endoneurial endothelial cells. The data collectively has led us to further hypothesize; that peripheral nerves may directly contribute to HO through the migration of resident progenitors to form both the heterotopic cartilage and bone. Further, the expansion of these cells and their migration may be a product of their co-regulation involving the endothelium within the endoneurium. We have devised three specific aims to test this hypothesis. (1) To determine whether perineurial progenitors are undergoing chondrogenesis. The astrocytic marker GLAST is uniquely expressed on the perineurial progenitors within the nerve, and we will use tamoxifen-regulated (Ert) GLAST-YFP mice to evaluate their lineage fate. We will also induce HO in UCP-DTA mice, where UCP1+ cells are ablated in the presence of diptheria toxin and characterize the formation of cartilage in their absence. (2) To determine if endoneurial endothelial-like progenitors within peripheral nerves undergo osteogenesis during HO. We will further characterize the cells for markers associated with neural progenitors, endothelial cells, and osteoblasts. Additionally, we will use Ert-Wnt1-YFP mice and/or Ert-PDGFR?-YFP mice to trace the tentative neural lineage of these cells, and analyze the resultant heterotopic bone for YFP+ cells. Further, we selectively remove osterix expression in these cells, using an Ert-Wnt1-Cre x Floxed osterix and analyze downstream bone formation. (3) To characterize the regulation of perineurial expansion, vascular sprouting and endoneurial progenitor expansion and migration during HO. We will test whether specific growth factors (such as LIF, PDGF,VEGF, CSF) expression are regulated during the early stages of HO, leading to the dissolution of the tight junctions as well as expansion of perineurial cells followed by brown adipogenesis as well as sprouting of axons and new vessels."
"9247592","Function of stimulus-induced MeCP2 phosphorylation Abstract MeCP2 is a key player in recognizing methylated DNA and interpreting the epigenetic information encoded in different DNA methylation patterns. Alterations in sequence or copy number of the X-linked human MECP2 gene cause either Rett syndrome (RTT) or MECP2 duplication syndrome. In addition to RTT-causing mutations, many missense mutations with unknown functional significance have been identified in the MECP2 gene in humans. Two of those mutations are at or close to serine 80 or serine 421, whose phosphorylation status is important for regulating MeCP2 function. To fully understand the significant role of MECP2 in regulating the development and function of the nervous system, it is important to study all aspects of MeCP2 function. We have previously demonstrated that phosphorylation at serine 421 (S421) can be induced by spatial learning, and that S421 phosphorylation plays critical roles in regulating MeCP2 binding to gene promoters, neuronal gene transcription, excitatory synaptogenesis, two types of synaptic plasticity (long-term potentiation and synaptic scaling), locomotion, learning and memory. Most recently, we discovered that S421 is also phosphorylated in adult neural progenitor cells (aNPC) isolated from the hippocampus. Interestingly, the stimulus, the regulation and the function of S421 phosphorylation in aNPCs are completely different from those in post-mitotic neurons. In aNPCs, MeCP2 S421 phosphorylation is induced by growth factors, linked to cell cycle, directly regulated by aurora kinase B, and plays critical roles in regulating the proliferation and differentiation of aNPCs through the Notch signaling pathway. These new findings further generalize MeCP2 phosphorylation as a common regulatory module in cellular functions. More interestingly, phosphorylation at serine 80 (S80) appears to be regulated differentially from phosphorylation at S421 in post-mitotic neurons, and plays opposing functional roles against S421 phosphorylation in both post-mitotic neurons and aNPCs. Collectively, these studies raise the possibility that dynamic phosphorylation states at multiple sites on MeCP2 may form a combinatorial code, presenting another epigenetic regulatory module in addition to DNA methylation and histone codes. To test this hypothesis, we propose to generate several novel Mecp2 knockin alleles carrying combinations of point mutations that either abolish or mimic phosphorylation at S80 and S421, and study the functional output of each combinatorial code in the well-established paradigm of neurogenesis in both mouse and human models. Our specific aims are: 1) To study the effects of double mutations at S80 and S421 on aNPC proliferation and differentiation in mouse models, 2) To study the effects of single and double mutations at S80 and S421 on NPC proliferation and differentiation in human stem cell models, and 3) To define the molecular mechanism linking MeCP2 phosphorylation with its functional output. Studying posttranslational modification of MeCP2 provides a critical angle of understanding the basic function of MeCP2, which will expand our knowledge of MeCP2 beyond RTT and MECP2 duplication syndrome."
"9359433","PROJECT I - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Ischemia-reperfusion injury (IRI) remains the primary obstacle limiting the success of orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) in patients with end-stage liver disease and those with tumors of hepatic origin. Our group has pioneered the concept that hepatic IRI requires activated CD4+ T cells to facilitate liver tissue damage. T cell immunoglobulin-3 (TIM-3; encoded by Havcr2 gene) is the central negative regulator of T cell activation. CEACAM1 (carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1; encoded by CC1 gene) has been identified as a new cellular ligand determining TIM-3 function. First, we found that compared with CEACAM1 proficient (WT) livers, CEACAM1 null-mutation (CC1-/-) exacerbated IRI in OLT. Second, we discovered that the benefit of recipient CD4+TIM-3+ signaling in IR-stressed OLT (WT?TIM-3Tg) was completely lost when CEACAM1 KO mice served as organ donors (CC1-/-?TIM-3Tg). These preliminary data have led us to central hypothesis that 1/ TIM-3 ? CEACAM1 negative regulation is essential to control IRI by imposing exhaustion-like dysfunction in OLT-infiltrating CD4+ T cells; and 2/ CEACAM1 in the donor liver promotes hepatoprotection. Project I will test this hypothesis through two interlocked specific aims: Aim 1: Define mechanisms of TIM-3 ? CEACAM1 negative T cell regulation in IR-stressed iso-OLT. A panel of mice available to us for Aim 1 experiments include CD4+ T cell mutants, which are: i/ CEACAM1Tg; ii/ double TIM-3Tg and CEACAM1-/-; as well as: iii/ TIM-3Tg and TIM-3-/- mice.  Aim 1.1. Hypothesis: CEACAM1 - TIM-3 signaling on host circulating CD4+ T cells promotes exhaustion- type phenotype in IRI?OLT.  Aim 1.2. Hypothesis: Under dominant CAECAM1 signaling, TIM-3+CD4+ exhausted T cells inhibit the development and progression of IRI in OLT. Aim 2: Define mechanisms by which hepatocellular CEACAM1 in donor liver regulates IRI in iso-OLT. Gene- targeted strains for Aim 2 studies include: i/ hepatic CEACAM1 inactivation (loss-of- function; L-CC1-/-); or ii/ forced hepatic CEACAM1 overexpression (gain-of-function; L-CC1Tg).  Aim 2.1. Hypothesis: Enhancement of hepatocyte-specific CEACAM1 ? ?-catenin regenerative functions facilitates hepatoprotection. Aim 2.2. Hypothesis: TIM-3 ? CECACAM1 signaling enhances hepatocyte autophagy program.  Integration with PPG: By providing novel insights into TIM-3 ? CEACAM1 checkpoint regulation at the innate ? adaptive immune interface in IR-stressed iso-OLT, Project I naturally informs/precedes studies assessing how host rejection regulates innate immune activation/IRI sequel in allo-OLT (Project II). Direct application of approaches blunting inflammation while promoting hepatoprotection in mouse OLT models will accelerate assessments of immune phenotypes in human liver transplants (Project III)."
"9306177","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The identification of causal relations is fundamental to a science of intervention and prevention. Obesity is a major problem for which much progress in understanding, treatment, and prevention remains to be made. Behavior is a vital component contributing to variations in energy balance and body composition, the final common pathways of obesity. Social factors are key influences on behaviors, and perhaps even physiological factors, which affect energy balance. Understanding which social and behavioral factors cause variations in adiposity and which other factors (e.g., environmental) cause variations in behavioral and social factors is vital to producing, evaluating, and selecting among intervention and prevention strategies as well as to understanding obesity's root causes. Evidence for causation (or lack thereof) of hypothesized influential factors exists on a continuum from weakest to strongest. Yet, most dialogue and research in obesity does not consider the evidence continuum between ordinary association studies (observational non-intervention studies among unrelated individuals), which do not offer strong assessments of causal effects, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which do offer strong inferences, but cannot be done in all circumstances. In contrast to this polarized view, there are techniques that lie intermediar between ordinary association tests and RCTs, including but not limited to quasi-experimental studies and natural experiments. Such designs are increasingly used, especially in the disciplines of economics and genetics, but are rarely used in obesity research. Our ability to draw causal inferences in obesity research could be strengthened by increased judicious use of such approaches. In-depth understanding and appropriate use of the full continuum of these methods requires input from disciplines including statistics, economics, psychology, epidemiology, mathematics, philosophy, and in some cases behavioral or statistical genetics. The application of these techniques, however, does not involve routine well-known 'cookbook' approaches but requires understanding of underlying principles, so the investigator can tailor approaches to specific and varying situations. Yet, no ongoing resource exists to provide such training and role models of scientists who regularly can and do traverse these disciplines are in short supply. The proposed annual 5-day short course on methods for causal inference in obesity research features some of the world's finest scientists who will help to fill this unmet need. This course for established and up- and-coming obesity researchers will be held annually at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The nine course modules are formatted to provide rigorous exposure to the key fundamental principles underlying a broad array of techniques and experience in applying those principles and techniques through guided discussion of real examples in obesity research. The NIH and the scientific community at large call for better assessment of causal effect in obesity research and more training on such methods. We request the opportunity to be part of the solution."

We expect high success of the project, owed in part to the remarkable community of life-science researchers in the 400 mile-long corridor from Boston to Washington, all within driving distance of BNL, and to the solid record of productivity in structural biology having been provided this community during the lifetime of the NSLS."
"9313702","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The objective of the proposed research is to investigate how genetic variation influences weight-related traits during the transition from adolescence to adulthood - a critical risk period for weight gain. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have identified >70 well-replicated loci influencing weight-related traits, some of which vary by race/ethnicity. Few studies have examined the genetic architecture of these traits during this critical period; the discovered loci are largely common variants that explain only a fraction of the estimated trait heritability. Fine-mapping studies suggest allelic heterogeneity; many causal variants remain to be determined. Recent attention has shifted to coding variants some of which may have larger effect sizes and potential to explain more trait heritability. We build on our successes in R01 HD057194 and capitalize on nationally representative, ethnically diverse, prospective and well-characterized data on 10,581 individuals from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) to assess the association between weight- related traits and coding variants across a 15-year lifecycle period of dramatic weight gain between adolescence and adulthood. In addition, to make full use of this excellent resource, we combine our data with extant exome data from the Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE) consortium (n>91,000) to further assess associations with adiposity phenotypes, an approach that will be particularly informative and powerful for the discovery of novel coding variants. Further, to fully ensure that we capitalize on the uniqueness of our longitudinal data on adolescent to adult weight gain, we combine our data with two well-characterized, age-matched cohorts with exome data (China Health and Nutrition Survey, CHNS n=1,951; Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey, CLHNS, n=1,691) living under different environmental conditions but experiencing high levels of weight gain analogous to Add Health. Using all three datasets, we will determine the genetic and epidemiological architecture of causal variants; identify functional SNPs and genes; and using advanced and innovative statistical modeling, examine differential genetic effects by age, time, and under varying environmental circumstances to downstream cardiometabolic risk factors (diabetes-, blood pressure-, and inflammatory-related markers). We will test novel hypotheses on tempo and timing of risk as well as address each piece of the complex system linking genetic markers, weight-related outcomes, and cardiometabolic risk factors, in the context of a variety of environmental and behavioral confounders. In sum, these data provide outstanding resources for examining low frequency coding variants associated with weight- related and cardiometabolic traits - a rapidly emerging area of science. Our longitudinal and complex analyses in this understudied age range will provide critical information about risk in the transition from adolescence into adulthood, a period of rapid weight gain when precursors of adult disease are developing. Our work will shed light on the progression of risk to inform efforts to mitigate early development of disease risk."
"9343025","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Depression is prevalent and depressed individuals are at increased risk for numerous physical health problems. More physical activity decreases risk of physical health problems, and there is growing evidence that physical activity reduces depression symptoms. However, depressed individuals have low rates of physical activity and poor adherence to exercise interventions relative to non-depressed groups. This is likely due, at least in part, to specific core features of depression such as anhedonia (lack of enjoyment), amotivation, and fatigue, as well poorer problem-solving abilities which may impede the ability to cope with cognitive/ affective and environmental barriers to exercise. Previous research on physical activity in depressed populations has focused primarily on whether physical activity is an efficacious treatment for depression. However, virtually no research has addressed key questions about optimal strategies for increasing and maintaining physical activity in depressed individuals. We propose a randomized clinical trial in which 240 depressed individuals are assigned to one of three arms, with each successive arm having an added component that may serve to increase and maintain physical activity: 1) brief advice (BA) to exercise (control condition); 2) BA + supervised & home-based exercise (SHE)+ health education(HE) contact control; and 3) BA+SHE+ cognitive-behavioral sessions focused on increasing and maintaining exercise (CBEX). There are two phases for participants: intervention phase (3 months), which consists of intensive contact, and the follow-up phase (6 months). BA will consist of one, 45-minute session about public health recommendations and strategies for getting started. SHE will be a 12-week intervention consisting of 1x/week supervised exercise plus exercise prescriptions for home-based exercise with the goal of gradually achieving the public health recommendation of 150 minutes/ week of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). CBEX and HE sessions will be individual, 30-minute, weekly sessions during the intervention phase. CBEX will address barriers to physical activity that are particularly pronounced in depression, as well as problem-solving skills for coping with barriers. During the follow-up phase, groups who received SHE during the intervention phase will receive brief, monthly phone check-ins from an exercise specialist. Our primary aims are to: compare the efficacy of the 3 arms for increasing MVPA during the 12-week intervention phase and during the 6 month follow-up phase. Secondary aims include: to assess the impact of the interventions on depression and physical health outcomes; to determine whether amount of MVPA mediates the association between group assignment and change in depressive symptoms; to examine behavior change theory-based mediators of the association between group assignment and MVPA; and to examine whether social and environmental barriers to exercise predict exercise maintenance. Given high rates of depression and associated morbidity and mortality, it is critical to evaluate whether how best to combine exercise interventions to increase MVPA in both the shorter- and longer- term."

"9285859","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): It was historically thought that astrocytes, which are non-neuronal cells in the brain, serve strictly structural and support roles, but recent research has revealed that astrocytes play important functional roles by modulating neuronal activity and synaptic function. Given their participation in the tripartite synapse, characterized by a pre- and post-synaptic neuron with a surrounding astrocyte, astrocytes are able to not only receive and respond (via calcium elevations) to synaptically-released neurotransmitters, but also release their own signaling molecules, termed gliotransmitters. It has recently been shown that manipulating astrocytic function in the hippocampus and other brain regions modulates neuronal activity, yet it remains unknown whether the same is true for the dorsolateral striatum (DLS), an area implicated in habit-type decision-making. Thus, the overall goal of this proposal is to examine the properties and functional consequences of neuron-astrocyte signaling in the DLS. Experiments in the first aim will assess bidirectional signaling between DLS neurons (medium spiny neurons (MSNs), the main cell type in the striatum) and astrocytes. Specifically, these experiments will test the hypotheses that astrocytes respond to MSN activity (Aim 1a) and influence MSN activity (Aim 1b) via calcium elevations and subsequent gliotransmitter release. Slice preparation electrophysiology will be used to measure synaptic transmission, and two-photon microscopy will be used to measure astrocyte calcium elevations. Astrocyte activity will be manipulated in Aim 1b via optogenetic and designer receptors exclusively activated by designer drugs (DREADDs) approaches to evaluate effects of selectively manipulating astrocyte activity on MSN synaptic transmission and excitability. Experiments in the second aim will assess in vivo effects of selective astrocyte manipulation (same manipulations as in Aim 1b) on DLS neuronal oscillation activity and behavioral performance. Specifically, these experiments will test the hypotheses that manipulating astrocyte calcium signals will influence DLS local circuitry (Aim 2a) and behavioral performance in a DLS-specific task (Aim 2b). In vivo extracellular recording will be used to measure local field potentials in the DLS, and behavioral performance analysis during a habit-forming task will be used to measure automation to the task. The task consists of training mice to turn left, right, or to alternate toward a food reward source, a task that is in part dependent on the DLS. As of now, it remains an open question whether astrocytes, which have been shown to play an important functional role in other brain regions, similarly modulate neuronal activity in the DLS and ultimately behavior. Such a finding will have significant implications for our understanding of the actual cellular mechanisms underlying brain function particularly in the DLS, and more generally in the brain as a whole."
"9305106","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Spinal cord injury (SCI) results in impairments of locomotor, sensory and autonomic functions, severely affecting overall health and quality of life. Recent discoveries related to activity-dependent plasticity in humans have led to a widely implemented rehabilitation intervention, Locomotor Training, which includes stepping using body weight support on a treadmill with manual facilitation. Evidence suggests that this particular type of task specific training optimizes the lumbosacral spinal circuitry. We have intriguing evidence from four SCI individuals who are unable to stand or walk showing improved bladder and sexual function after undergoing Locomotor Training. These changes in urogenital function may be due to activity-dependent plasticity of lumbosacral circuitry that mediates micturition and erectile functions.  Proper bladder management post-SCI is necessary to decrease the risk of upper urinary tract disease, a major source of morbidity. The life-long urologic care is required for SCI individuals, yet most efforts treat symptoms but do not improve intrinsic function. In addition, paraplegics rank sexual function as the function post-injury that should be given the highest priority in order to enhance quality of life. This proposal focuses on the mechanisms involved in the reorganization of spinal cord circuits for bladder and sexual function in response to activity-dependent plasticity induced by step training after SCI, with and without epidural stimulation. Stand training and/or arm crank exercise serve as controls. Of potential mechanistic importance is that neurotrophins have been implicated in modulating bladder function. It is therefore hypothesized that weight bearing task specific training for locomotion post-SCI induces plasticity of neural networks that mediate not just walking but bladder and sexual function as well and may do so for bladder function by reducing specific neurotrophins that are elevated post-SCI.  Our unique approach will utilize the expertise of each investigator to 1) To determine whether the effect of weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion on voiding frequency and urodynamic parameters is due to an interaction between locomotor and urinary bladder circuitry after traumatic incomplete upper motor neuron SCI in humans (versus standing or general exercise); 2) To assess the effect of LT on urine (biomarkers) and bladder (biopsy tissue) NGF and BDNF levels after severe incomplete SCI; 3) To determine the effect of weight-bearing task-specific training for locomotion on erectile function and sexual satisfaction after traumatic incomplete upper motor neuron SCI in humans; and 4) To assess the effect of epidural stimulation in combination with LT on voiding frequency, urodynamic parameters, erectile function, and bladder/urine NGF and BDNF levels after complete and motor complete/sensory incomplete upper motor neuron SCI in humans. Our innovative multi-disciplinary study may lead to the translation of a combination approach of weight bearing step training, epidural stimulation, and neurotrophic factor manipulation to promote functional recovery for multiple systems following SCI."
"9304996","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This is the renewal application for Years 26-30 of a training program designed to produce investigators at the cutting edge of research in the area of pediatric gastroenterology. Trainees will be at the postdoctoral level and a mixture of MDs supported for 3 years and PhDs supported for 2 years for a total request of 5 stipends/yr. to accomplish these goals. For all trainees, the program has traditionally placed strong emphasis on molecular biology, the rationale being that molecular approaches are of central importance in both study and treatment of diseases associated with pediatric gastroenterology. In the current proposal there is also emphasis on bringing the results of molecular research to the bedside with opportunities for intense training in clinical research. The mentors (9 MDs, 2 MD/PhDs and 11 PhDs) represent a multidisciplinary group of experienced investigators from various departments at Baylor College of Medicine (BCM), the University of Texas Health Science Center, and the MD Anderson Cancer Center. Their research covers four broad areas important to pediatric gastroenterology, namely: mucosal biology, molecular hepatology, immunology and inflammation, and translational biology. All mentor laboratories are well funded and well equipped. Existing faculty members (17 of 22) have excellent track records of interaction and participation in our training program activities. The five new faculty members have outstanding mentoring histories. The Program Director, Robert J. Shulman, MD maintains ultimate authority for the program and manages day-to-day operations. He is assisted by an Associate Program Director (Douglas G. Burrin, PhD for additional expertise in basic science research). Major administrative decisions (e.g., selection of trainees) are handled by an Executive Committee, which includes the Program Director, Associate Director, three other program faculty, and a senior faculty member not associated with this grant. The training program for MD fellows includes research rotations to facilitate selection of a mentor. Both MD and PhD trainees have individual research committees, must prepare a written research proposal to be defended to the research committee, and have semiannual reviews that include academic and career assessment. Both MD and PhD fellows are required to attend a weekly gastroenterology/hepatology/nutrition pathophysiology course, a biweekly research seminar series, a monthly journal club, and a thrice yearly scientific social. All trainees (MD and PhD) must present at these meetings. Trainees are selected from a highly competitive applicant pool that already exists at BCM. Over the past 10 years, trainees have performed well, with over 80% of MDs and PhDs remaining in academia; the majority has been successful in securing either internal or external funding for their research including K08, K01, R03, R21, F32 grants, as well as from other competitive sources. The current proposal includes several new features designed to enrich and enhance the existing program, in part, based on an invited outside review of the program.

"9308697","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Nephrotic Syndrome (NS) from Focal and Segmental Glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), Minimal Change Disease (MCD) and Membranous Nephropathy (MN) is a group of rare diseases that can cause catastrophic complications and end stage kidney disease. Despite their rarity, this disease group generates an enormous individual and societal economic burden. The currently employed, histopathology-based taxonomy of NS is inadequate and fails to capture the molecular bases of these diseases. Recent discoveries, which have identified causal genes in familial [mendelian] FSGS, the target podocyte antigen characterizing MN, and the association of APOL1 variants with FSGS histology in African American NS patients, provides indisputable evidence that multiple, unique disease mechanisms can present with indistinguishable histopathology. A Precision Medicine approach is necessary to identify and to execute specific therapies for each of the many unique glomerular diseases that result in NS. This requires understanding of the molecular bases of glomerular disease. Over the past 4 years NEPTUNE has advanced the care of NS patients by establishing a robust investigative infrastructure encompassing 21 sites, which has recruited more than 500 rigorously phenotyped NS patients, with biological materials and associated detailed clinical data. In addition, NEPTUNE has established robust training and ancillary study programs open to all interested investigators. In this renewal proposal, we propose to leverage these resources to further associate clinically meaningful endpoints with shared and specific genetic, molecular and structural features of glomerular diseases to generate a new, molecular NS taxonomy that will permit discovery of novel therapeutic targets and trial design. Two cohort studies will enroll NS individuals with (1) severe NS enriched for African Americans and (2) pediatric cohort with NS at time of first presentation prior to biopsy. These cohorts will add critical segments of NS disease phenotypes to reflect the full NS disease spectrum in NEPTUNE. Training and pilot programs will continue to leverage the unique resources in NEPTUNE and outreach in conjunction with patient interest group NephCure engaging lay communities, clinicians and scientists to advance NS research"

"9359436","PROJECT III - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Orthotropic human liver transplantation is the primary therapy for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. However, ischemia and reperfusion injury (IRI), the inevitable consequence of the transplant process, is a key limitation. The cellular damage incurred by IRI occurs in about 20% of cases and can lead to primary non-function necessitating re-transplantation. Liver IRI also predisposes the recipient to both acute and chronic rejection and graft loss, as well as, decreasing the pool of transplantable organs. Seminal observations in murine models indicate that liver IRI is mediated by both the innate and adaptive immune systems. Little is known whether similar mechanisms are at play in human liver transplantation. Our central hypothesis is that identifying the continuum of innate and adaptive immune phenotypes during human liver transplant IRI will permit us to select, monitor and refine the practice of therapeutic interventions and hence improve liver transplant outcomes. Under Aim 1 we will determine the role of DAMP/Pattern Recognition Receptor (PRR) signaling in the activation of innate and adaptive immune responses in human OLT IRI. We hypothesize that IRI-stressed hepatocytes release the endogenous DAMPs that trigger TLR and other PRR signaling on innate myeloid cells, which then induce adaptive immunity via T cell activation. We will investigate whether effluents from IRI+ allografts trigger innate myeloid cell activation through TLR/PRR signaling. Furthermore, we will define the role of DAMPs within the IRI effluent in triggering myeloid cell activation and see if DAMPs alter T cell activation and polarization. Under Aim 2 we will delineate the pathological signature of human liver transplant IRI. We hypothesize that IRI leads to activation of hepatocytes and resident Kupffer cells and LSECs, and recruitment/activation of myeloid cells and circulating T cells in human liver allografts, and this pathological cascade will perpetuate damage to the graft. To prove this concept, we will establish a ?transcriptome? profile for IRI biopsies to better understand mechanisms of injury and characterize the acute and long-term pro-inflammatory profile of IRI and elucidate interactions between innate and adaptive immune cells in situ. Under Aim 3 we will determine the crosstalk between alloimmunity and IRI. We postulate memory T cells enhance inflammation and tissue injury in human liver transplant through antigen-dependent and antigen-independent mechanisms. We will therefore determine if allospecific T memory cells augment human liver IRI and also determine if IRI potentiates alloreactivity. Detailed insights into the interactions of the innate and adaptive immune system in human liver transplantation IRI will generate novel concepts to better understand the mechanistic underpinnings and to develop novel therapeutics to treat this major clinical problem."
"9324295","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Hemiparesis (loss of motor control and strength in the arm and leg on one side of the body) is the most common problem after stroke, the leading cause of adult disability. Most recovery of strength and control occurs in the first 3 months post stroke. Subsequent recovery is mainly the result of learning to compensate with residual capacities. Animal models suggest that the early recovery occurs as the result of interactions between up-regulated repair processes around the region of the stroke (heightened plasticity) and training regimens. There has been very little study of the early period of stroke recovery in humans. In this proposal we will use two principal approaches to determine what distinguishes the state of the brain in the first 3 months after stroke compared to the next 6 months. The first approach uses non-invasive brain stimulation methods to test the hypothesis that the human brain has heightened excitability and plasticity in the first 3 months after stroke compared both to later after stroke and to age-matched controls. The second approach tests the hypothesis that patients are more responsive to motor training in the first 3 months after stroke compared to subsequent months. That is to say, patients early after stroke may be particularly good learners. Conformation of our two hypotheses about a time window of heightened plasticity and increased responsiveness to training will have important implications for future innovations in neuro-rehabilitation. First, if it is possible to detect the state of heightened plasticity in any given atient then it could be used to devise an algorithm for how to plan rehabilitation. For example, if heightened plasticity were still present then rehabilitation of impairment would be emphasized rather than teaching compensatory strategies that rely on spared capacities. If plasticity were seen to have returned to normal levels then compensation would be emphasized. Second, having assays of heightened plasticity will allow assessment of pharmacological and other approaches that attempt to prolong, augment or re-open this critical time window of recovery."
"9408820","Project Summary/Abstract  Efforts to achieve a cure for HIV continue to be stymied by the persistence of inducible proviruses in latently infected cells. If the cells constituting the proviral reservoir can be induced to actively produce virus, then the reservoir could potentially be cleared by means of native immune killing or extrinsic therapies. Efforts in this direction to date have been hampered by an inability to reliably stimulate the entire latent reservoir such that this clearance can be achieved. One potential mechanism that could contribute to suboptimal latent cell activation and clearance is variation in the HIV Rev/RRE regulatory axis.  Recent data from our laboratory have indicated that Rev/RRE functional activity varies greatly among primary isolates and that rather than acting as an on-off switch, Rev/RRE activity modulates viral replication. Upon re-activation, proviruses in latently infected cells with less functionally active Rev/RRE pairs would be expected to have decreased production of many viral proteins and virus particles, while continuing to produce normal levels of the immune modulatory viral Nef protein. Cells containing proviruses with low Rev/RRE activity may therefore be more difficult to clear in the so-called ?kick-and-kill? strategies for cure.  Experiments in this proposal are designed to test this hypothesis. Subaims1a and 1b will utilize an established latency model and a set of engineered viruses that have altered Rev/RRE activity to directly assess how reactivation of latently infected cells with various latency reactivating agents affects viral activation and outgrowth. Subaim1c will measure Rev/RRE function in replication competent viruses isolated from patients' latent cells. These experiments will determine how Rev/RRE function varies compared to sequences derived from the peripheral blood of newly diagnosed patients, and whether there has been any selection with respect to levels of Rev/RRE functional activity. Specific Aim 2 will measure CTL killing of latency-reactivated cells to directly determine how Rev/RRE activity variation influences the susceptibility of the cells to immune elimination.  Improved understanding of how the Rev-RRE regulatory system functions in viral latency may be one key to understanding why ?kick-and-kill? cure strategies have been unsuccessful to date. This information could in turn be used to optimize the ?kick? by modulating the Rev-RRE activity of latent virus. The proposed study thus has direct bearing on the most promising strategy to date to cure HIV and could provide crucial knowledge to advance this thus-far elusive goal."
"9209233","Abstract Influenza infection or immunization elicit robust humoral responses but mutations that accumulate in the influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) render both types of humoral responses seasonal: immunity against this season's flu does not reliably protect against next year's virus. Crucially, vaccine efficacy is influenced by each individual's history of infection and vaccination and this influence is long-lived and can be traced to the memory B cells compartments elicited by prior exposure to HA antigens. The immunological basis of this influence or clonal imprinting, is clonal dominance by memory B lymphocytes generated to cross-reactive HA antigens. Examples of clonal imprinting or original antigenic sin (OAS) have been well described, but the scope, durability, and structural constraints of imprinting have not been systematically studied. In project 2 we will use a novel method for large scale, single B-cell cloning to determine how and in which immunological compartments OAS is ?stored? and to define the structural similarities of epitope and paratope necessary for imprinting. Two types of memory B cells are responsible for the maintenance of humoral immune memory, IgM+ memory B cells (IgM+ Bmem) that have not undergone class-switch and class-switched (e.g., IgG+) Bmem; these small, quiescent lymphocytes reside in secondary lymphoid organs, where they are efficiently exposed to antigens.

"9311298","PROJECT SUMMARY - VDDRC FLOW CYTOMETRY CORE The Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting Core is an established core for the VDDRC. It was developed in direct response to member requests and approved by the Executive Committee and the Scientific Advisory Board with substantial institutional support provided by the University. This core provides access to state-of-the-art equipment for analytical cytometric analysis, cell counts and viability, and cell sorting, and it provides expert training and consulting on the use of these methodologies. Forty-five (45) VDDRC members used this core over the last funding period. The core facility maintains analytical flow cytometers, three cell sorters, an imaging cytometer, a mass cytometer, a mobile cytometer than can be positioned in any lab, and a high-speed plate sampler. The core provides both Mac and PC workstations, an extensive toolbox of software for flow cytometry, and digital backup of data on a secure remote server. Sample biosafety is carefully considered and policies and practices are in place to safely process samples and tissues up to the BSL-3 level. The staff provides both group and one-on-one instruction to facilitate development of acquisition and analysis skills for all users. Trained users can use the analytical cytometers directly on a 24 hour/7 days a week/365 days per year basis; sorting is an assisted-only service during normal operational hours. The core also has worked with VDDRC investigators to develop novel sorting techniques for elements of subcellular compartments such as vesicles. This technically forward work requires custom modification of the sorting cytometer in collaboration with the manufacturer, and involves a large number of technical components from gradient preparations, staining, lasers and fluidics, and downstream collection and proteomics analysis. The core works with VDDRC investigators in cutting edge fields such as Mass Cytometry to identify and analyze rare cells with high-content measurements. The core maintains an active development program to keep the instrumentation and systems current, functional, accessible, and easy to use. In fact, a number of our machines have been extensively customized with four or five lasers and special PMTs to accommodate user protocols. Individual researchers could not support this type of high-quality cytometry in their own labs due to the high cost of the instrumentation and maintenance."

"9385676","Abstract  The Bone Marrow Transplant (BMT)/Leukemia Program at Washington University ranks among the largest in the United States, performing over 400 transplants annually, including over 200 allogeneic transplants. The program has been affiliated with the BMT Clinical Trials Network (CTN) since its inception, initially as part of the Case Western Consortium, and more recently as a Core Center since 2011. During this time, our institution has made significant contributions to CTN through clinical trials accrual and trial design input. As part of this application for renewal as a Core Clinical Center, we propose a phase II clinical trial incorporating the use of a novel cellular therapy into a haploidentical transplant platform for elderly patients with relapsed refractory AML. The basis for this proposal is the demonstration that NK cells stimulated ex vivo with a cocktail of cytokines (IL12, IL15, IL18), exhibit an enhanced memory?like response to subsequent AML cell exposure both in vitro and in vivo in a mouse xenograft model. These observations led to a phase I dose- finding clinical trial to establish safety of haploidentical cytokine-induced memory-like (CIML) NK cells as therapy for elderly adults with relapsed AML, which has been concluded, and an ongoing phase II trial to define efficacy, with favorable preliminary results. On this basis, we propose to incorporate this CIML NK cell approach into a backbone of haploidentical donor stem cell transplantation with reduced intensity conditioning and post-transplant cyclophosphamide for elderly adults with relapsed AML. Our hypothesis is that this strategy will lower the incidence of relapse in this high risk population while preserving the tolerability of the reduced intensity conditioning approach. Completion of this study would require accrual of 30 patients, anticipated over a 2-year period in the context of a multi-center trial."
"9065981","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal by the University of North Carolina Project based in Lilongwe, Malawi aims to characterize safety, durability, ART resistance, and clinical outcomes for mothers and infants exposed to the efavirenz-based Option B+ regimen for Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) and HIV treatment in Malawi. Option B+ is an innovative strategy pioneered within Malawi that provides universal life-long ART (tenofovir/lamivudine/efavirenz: TDF/3TC/EFV) for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Importantly, Option B+ was adopted largely based on programmatic need and has not been directly studied in clinical trials. The safety of a TDF/3TC/EFV based regimen used during pregnancy has not been systematically evaluated. Notably, TDF/3TC/EFV has a low barrier to resistance such that women and infants may be particularly susceptible to resistance in the event of sub- optimal retention or adherence. Hence, the durability of the regimen may be sub- optimal over time and second line therapy may be required for subsequent pregnancies. Now, with over 2 years of follow-up time in the Option B+ program in Malawi, we are in a unique position to explore these questions related to treatment failure, in addition to the effectiveness and safety of second line therapy with Atazanavir/ritonavir among women presenting with subsequent pregnancies in the program. The proposed study will take place at four high volume antenatal sites within Lilongwe, Malawi where UNC project and the Baylor Tingathe Program (who will be collaborating on this study) have established infrastructure. Using a prospective cohort study design, we will enroll newly identified HIV infected women at the first antenatal visi and follow maternal and infant outcomes through year 3 post-delivery. Among women with subsequent pregnancies in the program, we will measure the prevalence of virologic failure and assess the need for second line therapy. In the event of failure, we will evaluate the safety of Atazanavir/ritonavir during pregnancy. Among defaulters of the program with subsequent pregnancies, after resumption of first line therapy, we will evaluate for early treatment failure and determine resistance profiles associated with this population. For all cohorts, key outcomes will include DAIDS grade 3 or 4 events, adverse pregnancy and birth outcomes, HIVRNA suppression, maternal and infant drug resistance, and infant neurologic development. Our research plan has been carefully developed to be complementary to existing program and research activities and anticipates the next critical questions that can only be answered with a more mature Option B+ program. Hence, our ability to answer these questions now will inform other programs as they embark on an Option B+ program."
"9491445","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Axon degeneration occurs after nervous system injury and in neurodegenerative disease. Loss of axons and synapses results in neural circuit breakdown and is thought to be a primary factor driving functional loss in patients with neurological disorders. Despite its widespread importance in disease, remarkably little is known about the molecular mechanisms driving axon degeneration in any context.  Studies of axon degeneration after axotomy (i.e. Wallerian degeneration) have proven an extremely useful approach to elucidate fundamental cellular events driving axon auto-destruction. For example, previous work on the mouse Wallerian degeneration slow molecule (WldS) revealed- surprisingly-that under certain conditions distal severed axon fibers can survive and remain functionally intact for remarkably long periods of time (i.e. weeks after axotomy) in the absence of a cell body. The long-term survival observed in WldS expressing axons raised the intriguing possibility that axon degeneration might be an active process of axon auto-destruction, akin to apoptotic cell death. In our first funding cycle we developed the first Drosophila models for Wallerian degeneration and demonstrated that severed fly axons undergo Wallerian degeneration that can be potently suppressed by the mouse WldS molecule. These data indicated the molecular mechanisms of Wallerian degeneration are an ancient, and conserved feature of neuronal cell types. Inspired by WldS we performed the first forward genetic screen for Drosophila mutations that suppressed Wallerian degeneration. Strikingly, we found that loss of the kinase adaptor molecule dSarm (sterile alpha/Armadillo/Toll-Interleukin receptor homology domain protein) suppressed Wallerian degeneration for the lifespan of the fly (>3 weeks). We also made the exciting discovery that this pathway was functionally conserved in mammals: Sarm1-/- mice exhibited robust suppression of Wallerian degeneration both in vivo and in vitro. This data identifies dSarm/Sarm1 as a conserved axon death gene, whose endogenous function is to promote axon degeneration after axotomy. In Aims 1 and 2 of this proposal we will use Drosophila to study the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which dSarm promotes axonal degeneration. In Aim 3 we will characterize a collection of novel Drosophila mutants that we have recently isolated that also potently suppress axon death like dsarm. These studies are at the heart of our long-term, comprehensive effort to understand how axons destroy themselves after injury. We expect our findings to have a major impact on our understanding of axon degeneration after injury or in human disease, and the novel molecules we identify will be excellent candidates for therapeutic intervention in human neurological disorders involving axonal and synaptic loss."
"9352467","Project Summary ? Research Education Core (REC) The overall mission of the Research Education Core (REC) will be to create the diverse human resources capable of conducting team-based interdisciplinary research focused on addressing the complex problems posed by chemical agents. Advanced training in basic and translational sciences, toxicology, and drug discovery will be provided to the next generation of researchers, more specifically, technicians, medical and graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and/or early stage investigators within and outside the UC Davis CounterACT Center. Accordingly, the REC will interact with all cores and projects of the Center. The educational environment at UC Davis is unique. UC Davis is a national leader in pharmacology and toxicology with over 100 faculty whose expertise includes fundamental toxicology, medicinal chemistry, drug screening, mechanistic target identification, animal models of disease, as well as preclinical testing and participation in clinical trials. The great depth and breadth of campus activities are reflected in the expertise found in the Center investigators. The training of future leaders in the development of medical countermeasures for chemical threat agents is critical to the success of the CounterACT program and to national emergency response and preparedness efforts. The REC will focus on three main objectives to accomplish this goal. Objective 1 will develop skill sets necessary for the study of toxicology and drug discovery related to chemical threat agents. First, hands- on interdisciplinary and collaborative research training primarily in the laboratories of the project and core leaders will be provided. Second, specialized didactic training in areas relevant to the Center's mission will be accomplished by presenting information via workshops, seminars, and specialized coursework. Objective 2 will enhance the recruitment of participants from underrepresented backgrounds into the CounterACT Center of Excellence in particular, and in toxicology and drug discovery in general. Objective 3 will evaluate the activities of the Core to assess effectiveness and identify areas for improvement. The REC will advance the knowledge and careers of Center trainees by providing opportunities to interact with and learn from both internal and external scientists with expertise relevant to the CounterACT mission. By fulfilling these aims, the REC will accomplish its goal of developing a diverse group of scientists with broader understanding of the concepts, challenges, and opportunities in drug discovery and development of medical countermeasures of chemical threats."
"9312953","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the Enrichment Program of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to advance digestive disease research by creating a forum where investigators will present new research findings, learn about new technologies, and pursue new collaborations. The Director of the Program and DHC leaders pursue this goal with four complementary aims. In the first aim ?to promote knowledge sharing through a weekly seminar and workshop series,? the Program sponsors a series of highly interactive seminars and presentations by investigators from the academic health center and extramural scientists who are leaders in digestive disease research. These seminars also include technology-centered workshops that are given by Core directors and staff. Presenters receive timely feedback and suggestions on their experimental approaches and emerging technologies. Seminars and workshops represent a nidus of collaboration and knowledge-sharing among participants. In the second aim ?to increase collaboration with other academic units by joint educational programs,? the Program Director seeks opportunities to partner with focus groups or study groups to fertilize ongoing interests in the field, with three recurring meetings with: 1) the ?Fluxes and Barriers? group of intestinal physiologists; 2) the ?Endoderm Club,? which focuses on organoid systems to model human disease; and 3) the ?Distinguished Speaker Program? with the Division of Developmental Biology to expose DHC investigators and trainees to the most successful scientists in the field. In the third aim ?to hold an annual scientific symposium to highlight digestive disease discoveries,? the DHC combines the annual visit of the External Advisory Board with a day devoted to digestive disease research via a highly subscribed symposium featuring a distinguished speaker and a scientific forum for the presentation of posters reporting novel findings by trainees and junior faculty. And in the fourth aim, ?to increase visibility for digestive disease research in the Academic Health Center? the Program publishes a quarterly Newsletter that is circulated throughout the academic health center to share information on upcoming seminars, accomplishments and awards of DHC investigators, and updates of Core services."
"9359431","CORE B - SUMMARY/ABSTRACT The Mouse Liver Microsurgery Core (Core B) will be responsible for conducting liver transplant surgery procedures and post-transplant care in mice in this PPG initiative. The orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) procedures in mice are technically highly demanding, and the maintenance of surgical technical quality and stability will be the key for the experimental success. Core B therefore will provide all the surgical assistance to the investigators in conducting liver warm ischemia as well as ex vivo liver cold ischemia combined with OLT, as outlined in Project I and Project II. The core will also coordinate experiments among the projects to maximize the use of samples from transplants and minimize the number of animals for transplant surgery. In addition, extra samples from transplants will be stored and maintained as the archive. If the Project requires additional surgical procedures, Core B will also provide support for other surgical needs in the proposals. The laboratory has developed the mouse model of extended hepatic cold storage and OLT a decade ago to study various aspects of innate and adaptive immune responses in organ transplantation. Significant amounts of experience, accumulated data, and available models will enable us to confidently conduct the complicated experiments in this Project. The specific aims of Core B are as follows: Aim 1. To provide OLT and local liver IRI surgery and post-transplant care in mice with quality and consistency. The core will be responsible for conducting all the microsurgical OLT/non-transplant procedures and post- transplant care in mice in Project 1 and 2. These procedures are technically demanding, and the Core will assure consistent and reliable surgical outcomes in conducting experiments, as proposed in this PPG. Aim 2. To coordinate experiments among projects and maximize the use of samples from liver transplants and recipients. The Core will coordinate experiments between Project I and Project II to maximize the use of samples from transplanted animals and thus to minimize the numbers and costs of animals for surgeries. Aim 3. To store extra samples and maintain the archive. The Core will store and record surplus tissue samples (liver grafts, host tissues, serum) and maintain them as an archive for potential future use. Aim 4. To provide support for other surgical needs. Core B will provide support for additional surgical procedures (e.g., portal vein injections; i.v. infusions), if needed."
"9353808","BTRC ADMINISTRATION and MANAGEMENT SUMMARY The National Resource for Quantitative Funtional MRI has an Administrative Core that coordinates all BTRC activities, i.e. the development and dissemination of new MRI and MRS methodology for the assessment of the changing brain, as well as the training in its use. The PI of this core is Dr. Peter van Zijl, an experienced expert in MRI and MRS technology development, who has a longstanding experience in managing multi-center collaborations. Daily operation of the BTRC is the responsibility of Dr. van Zijl in close interaction with members of the Executive Committee, which consists of the PIs of the four technical research and development (TR&D) projects. The full committee meets bimonthly or whenever necessary. The TR&D PIs are all in close proximity and meet/interact closely at least on a weekly basis. The general goals of the Resource are formulated by this Executive Committee with guidance from the internal and external advisory committees. The main goal is to create an environment that allows method development through the push-pull interaction between the physicists and engineers of the TR&Ds and the application scientists and clinicians heading the collaborative projects. In addition, the BTRC supports many service projects as test beds of the methodology in important areas of application. The committee also assures that technology is further disseminated through presentations, training courses, and software and data transfer to interested sites (See Training and Dissemination Section). The Resource has carefully designed operating procedures to establish the above-mentioned collaborative and service projects and for the management of the facilities in terms of humans and animal safety and equitable access to the scanners and facilities. Plans for long-term maintenance of the facility assure that the BTRC can function successfully. The progress of the BTRC is overseen by an External Advisory Committee (EAC) consisting of experts in the fields for our TR&Ds. This committee meets annually to advise on scientific progress and on the progress of the center in terms of its goals of collaboration, service, training and dissemination. A yearly report is submitted to NIBIB as part of the annual progress report. In addition to the EAC, we have several local committees that provide oversight, including a protocol review committee that evaluates all research projects in terms of human safety and research quality. The BTRC has strong institutional support, as outlined in letters by the president of KKI and the Chairman of radiology at Johns Hopkins University. Our resource enters its final 5-year period as stipulated by the sunset policy of the NIBIB. We propose a transition strategy to continue our successful development of technology facilitated through multi-disciplinary collaboration."
"9385500","Project Summary Lack of an HLA-matched donor has historically been a major obstacle to accessing allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (allo-HCT) in many patients, particularly those from ethnic minorities and mixed race backgrounds. Recent work pioneered by a few centers including ours has demonstrated that the use of T- replete grafts from HLA-haploidenical donors and post-transplant cyclophosphamide to control alloreactivity (HIDTptCy) is safe with low rates of treatment related mortality and chronic GVHD. This advance has heralded the possibility of almost universal timely donor availability for patients that need allo-HCT. Furthermore, the relatively low graft-acquisition costs of HIDTptCy will improve access to allogeneic transplantation in underserved communities and developing nations. When HIDTptCy are performed for neoplastic diseases, relapse or progression of malignancy remains the most important cause of treatment failure. This is particularly so when non-myeloablative or reduced-intensity preparative regimens (RIC) are used. Administration of proteasome inhibitor drugs post allo-HCT may reduce relapse through direct anti-cancer activity as well potential stimulation natural killer (NK) cell alloreactivity. Furthermore, proteasome inhibitors have been demonstrated to inhibit graft-versus host disease. In an institutional pilot trial we have assessed the safety of the administration of the orally bioavailable proteasome inhibitor ixazomib for 12 months following HIDTptCy using RIC. Preliminary analysis of this trial has shown minimal toxicity with relatively low rates of relapse albeit with short follow-up. Another agent with potential to decrease relapse rates post HIDTptCy is the anti-SLAMF7 monoclonal antibody elotuzumab. This antibody has been shown to activate NK cells through binding of this receptor and may be particularly effective post HIDTptCy given the existing evidence that NK cell alloreactivity is important at preventing relapse in this setting. The activity of elotuzumab may also be augmented by co- exposure to a proteasome inhibitor. The proposed trial will be a randomized phase II study comparing the post- transplant administration of ixazomib versus elotuzumab versus ixazomib + elotuzumab during the first year post HIDTptCy using RIC for acute myeloid leukemia. It will specifically test the hypothesis that these agents alone or in combination will decrease the relapse rate which has been previously documented to be 43% at 12 months in this setting without use of these novel agents. Furthermore, it will test the hypothesis that these agents will not increase the rate of non-relapse mortality and will be well tolerated. Accrual to the three arms will be stratified for factors shown to be significant predictors of relapse following HIDTptCy using RIC for AML in multivariable analysis. This trial will also determine which of the three arms has the most promising outcomes and thus merits formal comparison to the standard-of care (HIDTptCy using RIC for AML without post-transplant novel agent use) in a future randomized phase III trial."
"9393820","Project Summary Studies from hospital-based care suggest that hundreds of thousands of Americans die each year due to adverse events occurring in the delivery of care, making it one of the leading causes of preventable death in the United States. Emergency Medical Services (EMS) play a critical role in health and outcomes of Americans, providing the first response of the health care system for emergencies, natural disasters and traumas. While quality and safety issues have been examined and are being addressed in the hospital setting, they have largely not been evaluated in the prehospital EMS setting. EMS providers work in teams and their teamwork is critical to patient safety. The nature of teams ? number of providers, training and skills, task assignments, and interactions between team members ? is complex and dynamic. Studies that investigate clinical teamwork traditionally use single-point estimates and summative values to measure team performance. This approach does not describe how, why, or when variations occur, each of which could inform patient safety, determine inflection points for evidence-base care, and contribute to the development of interventions that improve teamwork and the quality of care. This proposal seeks to remedy this knowledge gap by adapting sequence alignment (SA) to systematically and holistically model clinical team processes. SA is a visual analytical technique that is used to align common elements between sequences and measure similarity, such nucleic acids in DNA or amino acids in proteins. This technique has also been used to align tasks performed by individuals in human activity. Tasks are different from amino and nucleic acids in that they span some duration of time and can be characterized by different attributes. For example, Sue performed resuscitation for five minutes in the ambulance followed by a pulse check for ten seconds. In teams, members can perform tasks simultaneously. This work plans to identify patterns of activity that influence performance in EMS teams by: 1) developing a temporal multi-dimensional analysis technique, 2) using that technique to identify patterns that distinguish high- and low-performing teams in simulation, and 3) determining if those patterns persist across different types of clinical cases. This research advances AHRQ's priorities of improving health care quality and promoting patient safety. New technologies and sophisticated analytic techniques offer unprecedented opportunities to understand and improve care delivery and patient safety. This F32 postdoctoral fellowship research and training plan will prepare me to advance as an independent investigator and to launch a program of research involving the application of computer technologies to model and interpret clinical team behaviors and target interventions to improve team performance, quality of care, and patient safety."

"9394359","ABSTRACT Trypanosoma brucei is a eukaryotic parasite responsible for the disease Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT), which has an at-risk population of 70 million. HAT is nearly always fatal without treatment, but current medications are expensive, difficult to administer, and rife with adverse side effects. Therefore, there is a need for the development of new drugs. One approach to which is targeting processes that are both essential for parasite survival and pathogen-specific. Ribosome biogenesis is the process of assembling numerous protein and ribosomal RNA components into mature, functional ribosomes. One critical process of ribosome biogenesis is the formation and incorporation of the 5S ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex into developing 60S ribosomal subunits. Recent high resolution cryo-electron microscopy structures have identified key inter- and intra-subunit interactions between members of the 5S RNP complex and the 60S subunit, which lead to conformational shifts in protein and RNA components of the ribosome. Therefore, the incorporation of the 5S RNP acts as a crucial regulatory checkpoint, with disruption of the process resulting in cessation of ribosome maturation at the level of the 60S subunit. Given that functional ribosomes are required for survival, this makes the assembly and incorporation of the 5S RNP complex a promising target for future drug development. Work in our laboratory has identified the trypanosome-specific proteins P34/P37 as a unique and essential part of the T. brucei 5S RNP. We have also shown direct and unique in vitro interactions between P34/P37 and the protein L5 and 5S rRNA, two well-studied components of the 5S RNP. Recently, we identified T. brucei homologues of the proteins L11, Rpf2 and Rrs1, which are involved in maturation and incorporation of the 5S RNP in yeast. We hypothesize that these homologues form a network of interactions between homologous and unique components of the 5S RNP complex, and are crucial for its formation and incorporation. The specific aims that will be the focus of this project are the following: 1) To characterize the interactions between the T. brucei homologues of L11, Rpf2/Rrs1 and other homologous and unique components of the 5S RNP complex using in vitro studies. 2) Determine the in vivo importance of L11 and Rpf2/Rrs1 in ribosome biogenesis using RNAi knock- down cell lines. HAT remains a significant disease burden on populations in many sub-Saharan African countries, in part due to the many problems associated with current treatments. Using small molecules to target the unique proteins P34/P37 and their essential role as members of the 5S RNP complex is a potential path to developing new treatments to combat HAT. Therefore, characterizing the network of interactions occurring between members of the 5S RNP complex in T. brucei will set a future path toward the development of small molecule chemotherapeutics as novel treatments for HAT."
"9360107","Project Summary/Abstract Network methods have emerged as some of the most useful approaches for analyzing functional MRI data. While great advancements have been made in these methods, limitations hamper the progress fMRI researchers can make in better understanding brain processes. In particular, researchers are typically limited to looking at properties within a network, such as how regions relate across time, and cannot simultaneously look at relations between known networks. However, increasingly hypotheses require understanding the brain at two scales: at the resolution of the regions of interest within a known network and at the network level. Further hampering progress is that few network methods available can reliably arrive at network models for individuals. Indeed, increasingly researchers are finding that brain processes vary greatly across individuals, and thus methods are needed that do not assume homogeneity. Brain processes in heterogeneous data can be better studied by using reliable and valid approaches that attend to individual nuances while assessing relations within and between networks. We propose to develop, test, and freely disseminate an algorithm for the network-based analysis of brain processes that attends to these problems. The theory driving our approach is that interactions within and between large neural systems and brain areas ? including multiple sensory systems, cognitive functioning, and attentional control - drive behavior and subjective experiences by working in concert with each other. Towards these ends, our software will provide statistical inference frameworks for conducting network connectivity and causal-inference analyses. Importantly, the proposed algorithm uniquely would enable researchers to address data dimensionality by correlating ensembles existing at lower dimension brain activity (i.e., data reduced to network activity) as well at higher dimensionality (i.e., the full functional brain parcellated into regions) within a unified modeling framework. Following the first stage of development and testing, we will validate the algorithms on data from within a highly controlled experimental design."
"9524876","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): AH (AH) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality due to a lack of effective treatments for this condition. As stated in RFA-AA-12-007, translational investigations are needed on new mechanisms and suitable pharmacological agents relevant to AH. This application is one of three that comprise a consortium (Translational Research and Evolving Alcoholic Hepatitis Treatment; TREAT) and include Indiana University, Virginia Commonwealth University, and Mayo Clinic. The Overall goals of the TREAT consortium are to perform patient oriented translational studies that will uncover and test new pharmacologically relevant targets for the treatment of AH. This specific TREAT-Mayo application will focus on expansion of recent studies that have revealed a key role for caspase dependent cell death pathways as a pathogenic culprit in AH. In this proposal, we will test the Central Hypothesis that the novel caspase inhibitor emricasan is safe and effective in patients with AH through a mechanism involving inhibition of hepatocellular apoptosis and sterile necrosis. We will also support the broader goals of the TREAT consortium by recruiting patients for a well annotated registry and by providing a mechanistic resource for human serum and liver tissue analyses that are broadly pertinent to liver injury, inflammation, and cell death. Thus, the Specific Aims of thi application are to: 1) Develop longitudinal observational cohort of patients with AH. We will develop a prospective multicenter registry of patients with well characterized AH and suitable controls that serves as the clinical and biosample based foundation for conducting human therapeutic (as described in Aim 2) and novel mechanistic (as described in Aim 3) studies. 2) Test the hypothesis that 4-week emricasan administration will improve survival in patients with AH. We will conduct an early phase randomized, blinded, placebo controlled study, which will include a special population of patients with severe AH who are not otherwise candidates for corticosteroid therapy based on specific contraindications. 3) Test the hypothesis that apoptosis and sterile necrosis contribute to development of AH and are pathogenic targets of emricasan. We will measure serum and liver tissue markers of both apoptosis and sterile necrosis to inform our understanding of how these molecular processes contribute to liver injury and inflammation in human AH. Thus, this study, submitted by a group of investigators with extensive experience in clinical AH and basic liver injury, will determine the safety and potential efficacy of a novel and innovative therapy, the caspase inhibitor emricasan, in patients with AH. Additionally, the proposed mechanistic analyses will elucidate how distinct cell death pathways contribute to human AH and how caspase inhibition abrogates these pathways thereby inhibiting liver injury and inflammation in patients with AH. Our track record in patient recruitment trials and expansive resources in liver injury pathways will also provide key components for the broader success of this consortium. In total, this application will provide a major step in advancing our understanding of the devastating condition of AH."
"9303212","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Three decades of research in the United States indicates that Americans who are dying often spend their final days in pain and receiving treatments they would not choose. One in five deaths among adults occurs in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care unit, where there are well-documented problems with clinician- family communication and end-of-life care. These deficiencies are associated with high rates of adverse bereavement outcomes among family members and poor quality end-of-life care. Unfortunately, there are no practical, generalizable interventions proven effective in mitigating these public health problems. In a pilot project, we developed the PARTNER intervention (PAiring Re-engineered ICU Teams with Nurse- driven Emotional Support and Relationship-building), an interdisciplinary intervention that 1) gives new responsibilities and advanced communication skills training to the local nurse leaders and social work members of the ICU team; 2) changes care defaults to ensure frequent clinician-family meetings; 3) adds protocolized, nurse-administered coaching and emotional support of surrogates before and during clinician- family meetings, and 4) increases use of palliative care services for patients with a poor prognosis. Our 2-year pilot study documented that the intervention is feasible, sustainable, and is associated with shorter ICU length of stay and lower hospital costs. The objective of this proposal is to conduct a multi-center, randomized stepped wedge trial testing the PARTNER intervention in 5 ICUs among 1000 patients with advanced critical illness and their surrogates. In Aim 1, we will assess the intervention's impact on surrogates' symptoms of anxiety, depression, PTSD, and decisional regret over 6 months of follow-up. In Aim 2, we will use validated instruments to assess the intervention's impact on communication about end-of-life decisions and patients' end-of-life experiences. In Aim 3, we will assess the intervention's impact on health care utilization during the index hospitalization and over 6 months of follow-up. The PARTNER intervention will have high impact if successful because it will be a pragmatic solution to important public health problems that potentially affect more than 600,000 adults who die annually in ICUs. The intervention is innovative in its theoretical grounding in decision psychology and behavioral economics, the breadth and intensity of support provided to surrogates, the systems-level design of the intervention, and the strategy to use the existing clinical team to deploy the intervention instead of hiring external interventionists. The work is feasible in our hands because our team of established investigators developed and successfully pilot-tested the intervention, and because we have a proven record of success conducting multi-center trials in ICUs."
"9313184","Project Summary Infants born to HIV-infected mothers are at high risk for HIV acquisition via breastfeeding. Yet, the WHO recommends exclusive breastfeeding for HIV-exposed infants since replacement feeding is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Although antiretroviral therapy can reduce transmission, the risk is high compared to that of heterosexual sex. Therefore, HIV-exposed, breastfed infants are an important target group for an HIV vaccine. HIV-exposed infants display altered vaccine responses compared to unexposed infants. Animal models have demonstrated that the development of certain T cell subsets, both in the mucosa and systemically, is determined by the presence of specific microbes in the gut, and may be important in determining adaptive immunity. In humans, there are many reasons to postulate that the gut microbiome of HIV-exposed uninfected (HEU) infants differs from that of HIV-unexposed (HU) infants, since their mothers have altered gut microbiome, and they are exposed to antibiotics and antiretrovirals during pregnancy and postpartum. This proposal tests the hypothesis that in HEU infants who are breastfed, the gut microbiome differs in diversity, structure and function, from that of HU infants, and that specific gastrointestinal microbial profiles correlate with immune response to early childhood vaccines. This proposal will utilize an already funded, ongoing cohort designed to identify correlates of immune protection associated with exclusive breastfeeding, the InFANT cohort, that is enrolling 500 HIV-infected mothers and their breastfed infants, and 150 HIV-negative mother- infant pair controls. As part of the InFANT study, comprehensive sample and data collection is occurring with detailed immunological assessments including vaccine responses. This proposal will utilize the existing infrastructure and samples to characterize the infant gut microbiome of 150 HEU versus 75 HU infants via 16S rRNA sequencing, and its succession in the first 9 months of life in breastfed infants, i.e. in the first week of life (prior to initiation of cotrimoxazole prophylaxis), 7, 15 and 36 weeks of age (Aim 1). The study will relate the microbial composition and its corresponding function (Aim 2) using shotgun metagenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics, to T cellular responses to BCG vaccination in 150 HIV-exposed infants. Finally, will translate associations between gut microbes and their byproducts will be tested for causative roles in vaccine immunity by colonizing germ free mice with specific organisms, proteins and metabolites from our preliminary data and Aim 2, and then assessing their consequent response to BCG using state-of-the-art tetramer technology (Aim 3). Aim 3 will also delve into mechanisms of microbiome-vaccine immunogenicity interactions by assessing global B and T cell subsets in the mesenteric lymph nodes and periphery. This study brings together experts in clinical, pre-clinical, immunologic, mass-spectrometric and microbiome analyses. This joint approach will be used to investigate in detail the mechanisms through which gut microbiome alters immune responses of HEU infants, leading to improved development of HIV vaccines for these vulnerable neonates."
"9366662","Although mechanical ventilation (MV) is life-sustaining in patients with respiratory failure, it comes with a cost. MV dramatically reduces diaphragm contractility, induces ventilator-induced diaphragm dysfunction (VIDD) and sometimes leads to weaning failure. VIDD includes reduced mitochondrial respiration and increased oxidative stress, muscle fiber damage and decreased diaphragm force production. In animal models, intermittent diaphragm contraction during MV support attenuates VIDD. However, there are only limited data addressing this problem in humans. Here, we propose to directly test the hypothesis that intermittent electrical stimulation (ES) of the human hemidiaphragm during prolonged cardiac surgeries with MV support prevents/attenuates VIDD in the active hemidiaphragm. Mitochondrial function is central to energy metabolism and skeletal muscle function in a chronically active muscle, such as the diaphragm. Although abnormal mitochondrial function is thought to precipitate VIDD in animal models, limited data are available concerning mitochondrial contributions to VIDD in humans. Of even greater importance, there are no interventions available to attenuate these defects in humans. Here, we will test the impact of an innovative experimental treatment, intermittent electrical stimulation (ES) of the hemidiaphragm during prolonged surgeries with MV, on mitochondrial function, single fiber contractile properties and catabolic muscle pathways in human diaphragm. Using a within-subjects experimental design, muscle samples from a stimulated hemidiaphragms will be compared with samples from the unstimulated hemidiaphragm. We will investigate mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress during prolonged CTS/MV, and the potential of ES to attenuate or prevent VIDD (Aim 1). Next, we will investigate the effects of ES on single fiber contractile properties and Titin integrity (Aim 2). Finally, we will study the effect of ES on proteolytic pathways (caspase, calpain and ubiquitin-proteasome) and ribosomal RNA markers of decreased protein synthesis implicated in VIDD (Aim 3). This research will provide evidence concerning the ability to improve mitochondrial function in the stimulated hemidiaphragm, and identify mechanisms contributing to human VIDD. Our long-term goal is to test various intermittent hemidiaphragm ES protocols on a larger population to determine its ability to prevent or attenuate VIDD. Data from this R01 application will advance our understanding of mechanisms giving rise to human VIDD, and may inspire new therapeutic strategies to maintain human diaphragm function during MV support."
"9288101","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project aims to elucidate a biological pathway which convergent evidence has implicated in ethanol response. At the center of the pathway is glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK3B), which has been shown to be inhibited via phosphorylation in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and nucleus accumbens (NAc) of rodents after acute ethanol exposure. GSK3B has also been shown to regulate GABA receptor clustering via its action on gephyrin, which may represent a plasticity-related pathway relevant to ethanol exposure. Studies on rodent drinking behavior have indicated that inhibition of GSK3B with specific pharmacologic inhibitors decrease ethanol drinking, possibly through altering the typical ethanol response. Using a specific inhibitor, Tideglusib, we will further investigate inhibition of GSK3B in relation to drinking behavior, as well as anxiety-like behavior, to determine whether drug treatment influences the usual anxiolytic effect of ethanol, or the anxiety-inducing effect of ethanol withdrawal. In conjunction, we will examine changes in the phosphorylation state of GSK3B following chronic ethanol exposure as well as withdrawal. Additionally, we will use a Cre-LoxP system to selectively knock out Gsk3b in specific brain regions to assess potentially localized or differential effects of the GSK3B pathway in the PFC vs. NAc on drinking behavior. RNASeq analysis will be performed on the knockout samples following chronic ethanol exposure to assess for downstream effects of Gsk3b deletion with particular attention to gephyrin and GABA receptor subunit transcripts."

"9352468","Project Summary ? Analytical Chemistry Core ? Core A The overall goal of the UC Davis CounterACT Center of Excellence is to identify and advance improved medical countermeasures for stopping seizures and preventing long-term consequences resulting from acute intoxication with chemical threat agents, specifically organophosphate cholinesterase inhibitors like diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), paraoxon and soman, or GABAA receptor blockers like tetramethylene- disulfotetramine (TETS) or picrotoxin.  The Analytical Chemistry Core (Core A) is a central resource designed to provide state-of-the-art, comprehensive analytical support to Projects 1, 2, and 3, and the Probe and Pharmaceutical Optimization Core (Core B). Specifically, Core A will develop methods for the detection of target compounds and their metabolites by liquid chromatography?mass spectrometry (LC-MS) or gas chromatography?mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and provide quality control (QC) analysis of standard solutions prior to their use in projects. Core A will use these methods to perform mouse and rat ADME (absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion) studies for antiseizure drugs, anti-inflammatories and neuroprotectants to assist all Center projects in dose selection and time of administration post-exposure, and Core B in the optimization of novel therapeutic candidates. Core A will work with Project 2 and Project 3 to identify biomarkers of seizures and neuropathology to subsequently be used as a biochemical test of therapeutic efficacy. Metabolomics techniques, both targeted and global, will be employed. Targeted metabolomics will focus on oxylipins and neurosteroids, since expression of these signaling pathways are altered after a seizure, while global metabolomics will be employed as needed to identify broader biomarkers of seizure and therapy. Additionally, Core A will continue improving methods for TETS detection since the currently existing methods are too insensitive for pharmacokinetics (PK) analysis. During the first project period, Core A developed a rabbit polyclonal immunoassay for TETS, which will be optimized for high throughput laboratory use and for field detection. Core A has more recently initiated work to develop a nanobody- based assay. These small, heat stable reagents are inexpensive to produce and often provide valuable assays for the detection of small molecules in complex biological matrices. Immunoassays using both the polyclonal and the nanobody system will be optimized, and packaged in biosensor formats in a field deployable platform for on- site detection. When there is a clear need from the projects, immunoassays to other biomarkers of exposure and effect, including other neurotoxic chemicals, and their metabolites, will be created. Having a specialized core providing analytical support for all projects and cores improves efficiency and ensures consistency across all components of the CounterACT Center."

"9329245","PROJECT SUMMARY / ABSTRACT Age-related skeletal muscle weakness and atrophy diminish the health and quality of life of many elderly people. However, the molecular mechanisms that cause muscle weakness and atrophy during aging are poorly understood, and highly effective therapeutic approaches do not exist. As a result, many elderly individuals suffer the consequences of muscle atrophy, including weakness, fatigue, restricted activity, falls, debilitation, and loss of independence. These issues place enormous burdens on patients, their families, and society in general. Our research program is focused on molecular mechanisms of skeletal muscle atrophy and the discovery and development of small molecules that could potentially be used to prevent or treat this condition. In preliminary studies, performed in mouse models, we identified the first example of a protein that is required for the loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, strength, and endurance exercise capacity during aging: the transcription factor ATF4. We found that conditional knockout mice lacking ATF4 expression in skeletal muscle fibers from birth develop normally and exhibit normal muscle mass and function into middle age; however, they are resistant to age-induced declines in muscle mass, strength, quality, and endurance exercise capacity. Conversely, forced expression of ATF4 in young adult skeletal muscle fibers is sufficient to induce atrophy. Furthermore, we discovered two structurally dissimilar small molecules that significantly reduce age-related muscle weakness and atrophy, and interestingly, both of these small molecules blunt ATF4 activity in aged skeletal muscle. Collectively, these results strongly suggest a key role for the ATF4 pathway in age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. Moreover, these data elucidate several important areas for further investigation. For example, we do not yet know if a specific reduction of ATF4 activity, acutely applied to aged skeletal muscle, is sufficient to treat age-related muscle weakness and atrophy. Moreover, the downstream mechanisms by which ATF4 promotes muscle weakness and atrophy during aging are not understood. To begin to resolve these important issues, we propose three specific aims, all using mouse models. In Aim 1, we will test the hypothesis that an acute, targeted reduction of ATF4 expression in skeletal muscle fibers of old mice will reverse age-related changes in muscle mass and function. In Aim 2, we will identify ATF4-dependent mRNAs that are required for age-related skeletal muscle atrophy, testing the hypothesis that ATF4 promotes muscle loss by activating certain skeletal muscle genes whose protein products are necessary for muscle fiber atrophy during aging. In Aim 3, we will determine the role of ATF4 in protein metabolism in aged skeletal muscle, testing the hypothesis that ATF4 is at least partly responsible for age-related derangements in protein metabolism that are central to muscle weakness and atrophy. Through these studies, we hope to elucidate fundamental molecular mechanisms and new therapeutic approaches for age-related muscle weakness and atrophy, a disabling condition that affects millions of elderly people in the US alone."
"9307559","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The human brain is made up of an array of functionally and structurally defined regions. Localizing these regions is critical for early diagnosis of an array of diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), as well as for neuroscientific research aimed at understanding the brain's functional and structural properties and clinical intervention in drug-resistant depression. Unfortunately, direct visualization of the laminar properties that are one of the defining characteristics of cortical areas is beyond current imaging technology, except in specialized cases that represent a small fraction of the entire cortex. In this project we propose to develop tools for segmenting cortical areas and laminar boundaries using ultra-high resolution ex vivo MRI and optical coherence tomography (OCT), then to make in vivo inferences via probabilistic modeling. This will allow us to develop and distribute tools that should permit automated areal and laminar localization, facilitating an array of clinical and neuroscientific research. The proposed analysis stream holds the promise of automatically deriving new laminar and area-specific morphometric measures, a critical advance in our goal of detecting neurodegenerative disorders early in their course, when therapeutic intervention is still possible, as well as for guiding disease treatment and staging in individual patients suffering from diseases such as depression or multiple sclerosis."
"9395270","Project Summary/Abstract GATA6 and GATA4 are two members of the GATA family of zinc finger transcription factors and have been shown to be important for pancreatic development. Heterozygous mutations in GATA6 and GATA4 account for the majority of cases of patients with pancreatic agenesis. However, GATA6 and GATA4 clearly play a more complex role in pancreatic development and function as these same heterozygous mutations can result in diabetes of varying onset and severity in some individuals without pancreatic agenesis, differing even within family members carrying the same mutations. Factors that cause disease due to haploinsufficiency can be particularly important therapeutic targets as small modifications in their action could be the difference between disease and normal function. Therefore, understanding the role of the GATA factors will advance our knowledge of beta cell function. Though these proteins have been studied in mice, they do not recapitulate the human phenotype, making studies in human cells necessary. The development of techniques to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into pancreatic cells has allowed for the use of a human system in which to accomplish these investigations. Preliminary data from our group show that GATA6 is necessary for normal endoderm induction during differentiation of hPSCs, and that loss of GATA6 results in defective glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in differentiated pancreatic beta cells. Additionally, preliminary studies show that GATA6 and GATA4 expression can be induced by retinoic acid, one of the inductive signals involved in the differentiation of pancreatic cells, suggesting interaction between the two pathways. The research described in this proposal will use two human models of pancreatic beta cells, differentiated hPSCs and a human beta cell line, to characterize the role of GATA6 and GATA4 in glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and to define the interaction between the GATA factors and retinoic acid signaling. By selectively knocking down and overexpressing the GATA factors in mature pancreatic beta cells, we will be able to determine their effect on insulin secretion independent of their effect on development. Utilizing this same technique in both differentiating and mature pancreatic beta cells while modifying retinoic acid signaling, we will be able to characterize the interaction between GATA4/6 and retinoic acid. These studies will help advance our knowledge of pancreatic beta cell function and development and therefore allow for a better understanding of the pathophysiology underlying diseases resulting from their dysfunction, including diabetes."
"9320816","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The long-term objective of this application is to develop methods for the efficient determination of atomic-resolution three-dimensional (3D) structures of large biological complexes by cryo electron microscopy (cryoEM). In the current funding period, the PI's group has developed data acquisition and processing methods, implemented software, and validated these advances by determination of cryoEM structures of a number of large icosahedral and helical complexes, as well as complexes of low or no symmetry, some to an unprecedented 2.9A resolution. We hypothesize that further advances in cryoEM and single-particle reconstruction can be obtained by taking advantage of electron counting and super-resolution capabilities of direct electron detectors for determination of atomic models for even larger or transiently stable complexes.  Whereas we aimed and succeeded in the current funding period to obtain cryoEM structures at atomic resolution for icosahedral and helical viruses, the goal of this renewal application is to develop methods for atomic structures for even larger complexes, including those that are only transiently stable. In the renewal, we propose to improve both imaging itself and computation to bring resolution to ~2A, permitting identification of small ligands or drugs in large complexes, even resolving holes of benzene rings of aromatic side chains. Specifically, we will develop novel imaging and image correction methods that take advantage of the practically noise-free images afforded by a newly installed direct electron detector (Aim #1); achieve high-resolution reconstructions of complexes that are deformable or intrinsically structurally heterogeneous by a symmetry- based selection method (Aim #2); test use of de novo atomic models to refine orientation and center parameters to further improve map resolution and model accuracy (Aim #3); and validate these new methods for atomic structure determination by application to the icosahedral complexes cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV), herpesvirus capsids and membrane-containing dengue virus, filamentous complexes including tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), NS1 tubule and actin, and other biological machines such as pyocin, pyruvate dehydrogenase and telomerase complexes (Aim #4).  A successful outcome of this renewal project will further push the resolution limit of cryoEM in structural studies of large complexes and will have great impact on many areas of biomedical research. This achievement will complement other structural methods, particularly X-ray crystallography of purified proteins that are amenable to crystallization and NMR of small molecules in solution. Specifically, this achievement will enable investigators to place individual proteins within the structural context of the larger assembly and to visualize native shapes and physical chemical interactions among the parts of the complex. Moreover, the ability to look at large complexes at atomic resolution will permit visualization of complexes bound to antibodies,"

The overall purpose of the Network for Tobacco Control among Women in Antioquia, Colombia, is to establish community and institutional capacity to promote gender-relevant tobacco control efforts among Colombian women. The goals of the ?Network? are to reduce tobacco use and exposure to environmental tobacco smoke among women in Antioquia. These goals will be accomplished utilizing the principles of Community-Based Participatory Research and the Empowerment Model, and will be guided by a multi-level approach that will address four target levels: individuals, organizational systems, policy makers, and agents-of-change across the major components of tobacco control across the lifespan (prevention, cessation, environmental tobacco exposure, and policy). We will first establish a network of representatives (e.g., education, health, policy) across the department of Antioquia followed by capacity building in which network partners will train and empower each other to carry forward the Network mission. The next step will consist of a needs/assets assessment phase in which network partners will assist in the identification of needs/assets regarding tobacco control among (and for) women in order to establish priority areas for intervention. Based on the results of these assessments, network partners, in consultation with their constituents, will develop a Community Action Plan (CAP), which will consist of a comprehensive tobacco control plan targeting women in Antioquia. As required by the Program Announcement, we will implement a pilot project in Year 2, addressing one of the research priorities identified by the network. In synergism with these efforts, we will implement a Tobacco Control among Women Workshop targeting academicians, professionals, and students."
"9282440","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Cortical structures (the hippocampus and neocortex) are critical for cognition and perception, and their improper function is implicated in intellectua disability and autism. The establishment of proper cortical circuits requires a complex interaction of neural activity and genetic programs that control the formation and elimination of specific synaptic connections. Studies of structural excitatory synapses, such as spines, find there is a rapid period of synaptogenesis early in postnatal development followed by a later period of elimination (or pruning) - in both humans and mice. Importantly, sensory experience and circuit activity drives the pruning of spines in vivo. Spine elimination is also triggered by learning in adults and may mediate the refinement of circuits that maintain memories. However, spines are an indirect measure of synaptic number and provide little information about how pruning regulates synaptic function and connectivity of specific cortical pathways. Furthermore, virtually nothing is known of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of activity and sensory experience-dependent synapse elimination in cortical neurons. Using assays of synaptic function in isolated cortical pathways, we have accumulated evidence indicating that activity-dependent synaptic pruning is regulated by the activation of the Myocyte-Enhancer Factor 2 (MEF2) family of transcription factors. We find that the RNA binding protein, Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein (FMRP) is required for MEF2- triggered synapse elimination by regulating the translation of MEF2-generated transcripts - including Protocadherin10 (Pcdh10) and Arc/Arg3.1. We find that Arc and Pcdh10 mediate elimination of synapses through distinct mechanisms. Importantly, loss of function mutations in MEF2C, FMRP and Pcdh10 are linked to intellectual disability (ID), autism and circuit hyperexcitability. Little is known of the physiological and in vivo conditions that lead to elimination of functional synaptic connections on cortical neurons and if or how this involves MEF2c, FMRP, Pcdh10, and Arc. In Aim 1 we will use optogenetics to induce physiological patterns of CA1 neuron firing and synapse elimination to determine the role of MEF2 isoforms, Fmr1 and Pcdh10 in physiological activity-dependent synapse elimination. In Aim 2 we will determine if endogenous MEF2 isoforms contribute to developmental pruning of functional excitatory synaptic connections onto cortical neurons in vivo. We also have new data suggesting that a novel experience activates MEF2-dependent Arc transcription which primes CA1 neurons for long-term synaptic depression upon activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR-LTD). Novelty-priming of mGluR-LTD may be a precursor to synapse elimination and contribute to the formation of sparse cortical network representations of memories. In Aim 3 we propose to determine if MEF2 contributes to novelty-induced gene expression, priming of mGluR-LTD, and novelty habituation. In Aim 4 we will use optogenetics and electrical stimulation to establish an in vitro model of novelty-induced priming of LTD to reveal cellular mechanisms."

The significance is to aid the patient selection for new drugs that target this receptor, in particular a new antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) that targets osteoactivin for treatment of triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). The goal is to develop a Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging agent that binds to osteoactivin to stratify TNBC tumors that will most likely respond to the treatment with the ADC, known as Glembatumumab-vedotin (CDX-011), and predict response to such therapy in tumor-bearing mice. My approach is to radiolabel the osteoactivin-specific naked antibody, Glembatumumab (CR011), with the positron-emitting radionuclide, 89Zr. I will optimize the chemistry to synthesize 89Zr-CR011 and use this agent to (i) assess the expression of osteoactivin in known cell lines and patient derived tumor xenografts, (ii) evaluate changes in osteoactivin expression in vivo throughout CDX-011 therapy and (iii) explore the induced upregulation of osteoactivin using chemotherapies currently used for the treatment of TNBC to enhance the potency of CDX-011. The outcome of this project will help in treatment planning for a disease previously considered to be non-targetable. My long-term goals are to become an independent investigator focusing on developing novel radiopharmaceuticals for non-invasive imaging of cancer biomarkers to help define optimal treatment strategies and to translate these new radiopharmaceuticals to clinical trials to identify patients who will likely benefit from targeed therapies. With the mentorship of Dr. Suzanne Lapi, an expert in PET imaging and development of novel radiopharmaceuticals, Dr. Cynthia Ma, an expert in the treatment of TNBC in preclinical and clinical studies, and Dr. Shunqiang Li, an expert in the development of patient-derived xenografts, I will expand my current proficiencies in biological chemistry and radiochemistry to include cancer biology, clinical oncology, and further advance my knowledge of imaging. At Washington University, I have all the resources to conduct the K99 phase of this award and my mentoring team has the combined expertise and mentoring experience to help me become an independent investigator."
"9303471","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumor in humans, distinguished by prominent vascularity and extraordinary vascular abnormality. Most GBM tumors are refractory to conventional cytotoxic therapies. Overgrown, abnormal vasculature characterizes the microenvironment that fuels cancer progression and induces spatially heterogeneous hypoxia and therapeutic resistance in malignant solid tumors. Anti-angiogenic therapies, primarily targeting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A and its receptors, have been developed and exploited in recent years; however, the therapeutic benefits are small in GBM, due to acquired treatment resistance and other unidentified mechanisms. Here we show that endothelial cell (EC) plasticity-mediated vascular transformation is critical for aberrant tumor angiogenesis and therapy resistance, therefore serving as a new therapeutic target in GBM. We discover endothelial fibro-transformation (Endo-FT) in GBM vasculature, by which ECs acquire fibroblast phenotypes including high motility and invasiveness to generate excessive abnormal vasculature. Utilizing human specimen and orthotopic, genetic mouse tumor models, our preliminary studies reveal robust Endo-FT in GBM, characterized by EC expression of the mesenchymal markers, and a prominent population of GBM-associated mesenchymal cells with EC origin. Furthermore, our proteomic analysis identifies a critical role of c-Met in Endo-FT, requisite for the vascular abnormality in the GBM microenvironment. c-Met phosphorylation induces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-14 expression and Endo-FT. Finally, our in vivo data using EC-specific c-Met knockout mice establish a critical role of c-Met in Endo-FT, cancer growth and progression, and GBM resistance to temozolomide chemotherapy. Based on these results, we hypothesize that Endo-FT is a driving force for aberrant tumor vascularization, and targeting Endo-FT provides a novel strategy to inhibit excessive angiogenesis, normalize tumor vessels, and overcome therapy resistance in GBM. To test this hypothesis, we will 1) determine the in vivo role of c-Met-mediated Endo-FT in tumor hypoxia, glioma progression and therapeutic resistance, and test experiment therapy that combines c-Met inhibition and radiation or chemotherapy in mouse tumor models; 2) define the mechanisms by which HGF/c-Met induces Endo-FT and vascular abnormality with a focus on HGF autocrine and MMP-14 expression; and 3) perform system-wide analysis of the Endo-FT and vascular transformation, focusing on platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)- and hypoxia-mediated mechanisms. Successful completion of this project may provide alternative insights into aberrant tumor vascularization and lead to development of new anti-angiogenic and vessel normalization strategies for treating GBM."

"9518104","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This renewal application seeks continued support for years 36-40 of the Washington University Training Program in Immunology and Immunogenetics. Washington University has made a strong and lasting commitment to Immunology research and training through the development of an Immunology Graduate Program, responsible for directing graduate education in Immunology and coordinating the Immunology-related activities of the 50 faculty, 135 postdoctoral fellows and 71 graduate students that constitute our Immunology community. The Immunology community at Washington University has achieved a world-recognized status. It is characterized by a collaborative atmosphere that has helped establish an excellent environment for training young Immunologists. This grant and the Washington University Immunology Community have formed a symbiotic relationship where the growth of the community has been catalyzed through the benefits of trainee support afforded by this training grant and the quality of our training program has been enhanced by the growth and interactive nature of the community. This program contains elements that insure the appropriate training of Immunologists at both the predoctoral and postdoctoral levels. Fundamental laboratory research resides at the center of the training experience for both types of candidates. A total of 38 Immunology research faculty are listed on this grant but trainees can work with any of the 50 Immunologists in residence at Washington University. In addition, all trainees participate in University-wide Immunology seminars, journal clubs, work-in-progress meetings and retreats. Predoctoral trainees must complete and show competence in a rigorous curriculum of basic training where they are exposed, through formalized classroom experiences, to historical, modern and emerging concepts of Immunology, related biomedical sciences and research ethics. Postdoctoral trainees are provided with a similar scientific training, but additionally, they are mentored/advised for careers in immunology and a separate ethics course. To insure continuity of the comprehensive Immunology training experience that has been established at this institution, we request renewal of our 10 predoctoral and 6 postdoctoral trainee slots, a number that is unchanged from that of the current funding period.  The field of immunology impacts many areas of medical science, including autoimmune diseases, such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, allergies, vaccines, and cancer. The training of predoctoral students and postdoctoral fellows is an essential component of this research, and greatly helps today and in the future, the development of treatments and cure for these diseases."
"9319030","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The composition and volume of the body fluid are determined by the kidney. Thus, the mechanisms through which the kidney senses, responds to and adjusts the composition of the forming urine constitute the principal pathways through which the body controls its internal environment. The central importance of these mechanisms in human health is aptly illustrated by the pathophysiological consequences of their perturbation. Breakdowns in the regulation of renal fluid and electrolyte transport result in a wide variety of serious and common conditions. In order to understand how the composition of the urine, and thus of the body fluid is determined, it is necessary to develop a holistic understanding of all of  these processes. It is critical to identify the cellular and molecular mechanisms through which the properties of transport proteins and of the paracellular pathway are determined. In addition, it is necessary to elucidate the cellular machinery that controls these regulatory processes.  As has been true for our entire history, the overall goal of this Program Project is to understand the  mechanisms underlying renal fluid, electrolyte and macromolecule transport. Towards this end, we use a broad spectrum of techniques to address a continuum of problems ranging from the molecular characterization of individual transport-related proteins to the contribution of these proteins to integrated renal function at the level of single cells, intact tubules, the kidney, andthe whole animal. The specific objectives of these projects together constitute a collaborative and synergistic effort to define the mechanisms that regulate multiple aspects of renal transport. No segment of the renal tubule and none of the transport processes that it mediates work in isolation. By exploring several transport processes simultaneously and through a variety of collaborative approaches, we will be able to generate new insights into these complex inter-relationships. It is only through such a coordinated effort that a systematic understanding of renal function can be generated."
"9319308","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): We aim to study how neural activity at the level of single unit responses in the hippocampus mediates the known roles of synaptic plasticity and hippocampal neural circuitry in learning and memory. In particular, we are interested in the synaptic plasticity and circuit mechanisms responsible for the activation of hippocampal units in the rat in precise sequences that depict past and future behavioral trajectories. (1) Pioneering work has established that place field responses can reflect multiple aspects of memory and exhibit a complex dependence upon mechanisms of synaptic plasticity, and yet experience-dependent changes to place fields tend to be rather subtle and challenging to detect. In contrast, trajectory-specific place-cell sequences can be detected after very little experience. We will examine the dependence of this possible learning effect on mechanisms associated with synaptic plasticity, with particular attention to the interesting counter-hypothesis that the sequences may exist prior to experience. Preliminary data show that synaptic plasticity is required during experience in order to encode replay memory, whereas the generation of replay per se does not require synaptic plasticity if the underlying memories have already been formed. We will pursue these experiments to understand how multiple mechanisms of synaptic plasticity shape place-cell sequences. (2) A central role for CA3 in the generation of replay is a longstanding but untested prediction. Previous studies using genetic silencing of CA3 input found preserved ripple patterns in CA1, but these studies may have allowed compensatory effects due to the long time course of suppression. We will pursue an optogenetic approach for instantaneous suppression. Preliminary data show that ripples and ripple-associated spiking are in fact dependent upon CA3 input to the locally recorded CA1 region. We will also online decode replay sequences in real-time, to selectively disrupt sequences and also sequence subcomponents. We will dissect the contribution of CA3 to replay initiation, direction, propagation and termination. (3) During the theta exploratory state, CA1 units are driven by two major inputs: CA3 and entorhinal cortex (EC), which recent reports show may interact in complex ways, both within and across different theta cycles. These hypothesized interactions have not been tested directly, and so we will utilize our optogenetic approach to examine CA1 unit activity during this state. Preliminary data show that in contrast to ripples, CA1 spiking is only partially reduced when CA3 input is suppressed during theta, unmasking the EC contribution. We will examine place fields, phase precession, theta sequences, and the synchronization of CA1 low/high gamma with CA3/EC, either with or without CA3 input. Taken together, these specific aims represent a unique approach that utilizes the power of ultra-high density unit recording together with pharmacological and optogenetic manipulation, to deliver insights into the neural basis of learning and memory. Our results will have a major impact on understanding those diseases that impair hippocampal learning and memory such as Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, stroke and normal aging."
"9315924","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia (SCZD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder. While 1.1% of the population suffers from SCZD, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease state remain unclear. Though its characteristic symptoms typically appear late in adolescence, SCZD is believed to result from abnormal neurodevelopmental processes that begin years before the onset of symptoms. We previously reprogrammed fibroblasts from SCZD patients into human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and subsequently differentiated these disorder-specific hiPSCs into neurons; SCZD hiPSC neurons have reduced neuronal connectivity and altered gene expression relative to controls. Because gene expression profiles of our hiPSC-derived neural cells most resemble first trimester neural tissue, we believe that hiPSC neural cells are best used to study the embryonic developmental effects that contribute to disease initiation. Childhood-onset SCZD (COS) is a rare and particularly severe form of the disorder. Because COS patients present with symptoms much earlier than adult-onset cases of SCZD, our hypothesis is that neural cells derived from patients with COS will share cellular phenotypes with those we have already reported for adult-onset SCZD, but that the phenotypes may be accelerated and/or more severe. We believe that hiPSC studies of COS are an ideal platform from which to glean mechanistic insights into the early cellular and molecular factors responsible for disease initiation in SCZD. We have four primary goals for this BRAINS R01. First, we will generate hiPSC-based models of COS. Second, the cellular phenotypes of COS neural cells will be characterized across a panel of existing and validated assays. Third, mRNA and microRNA expression of COS neural cells will be integrated through causal network interference analysis in order to identify key microRNA regulators. Finally, we will begin mechanistic studies of candidate microRNAs altered in COS. We hope to use our novel hiPSC based platform to identify molecular insights into COS which may be generalizable across SCZD."
"9263401","ABSTRACT Borrelia mayonii is the causative agent of a newly-recognized tick-borne disease. First reported in the upper Midwest during February, 2016, the geographic range of this emerging public health threat is not yet known. Although B. mayonii is related to the classic Lyme disease agent, Borrelia burgdorferi, the two species exhibit substantial genetic differences. We hypothesize that those differences are responsible for the distinct features of B. mayonii infection. A striking difference between the two diseases is the high spirochetemia that has been observed only in patients infected with B. mayonii. Other symptoms of B. mayonii infection include macular rashes across the body, myalgia, and neurological signs, with some patients requiring hospitalization. Three critical questions about B. mayonii and its associated disease are being addressed by our studies: (1) What are the extents of spirochetemia, tissue pathology, and other infectious qualities in untreated mammalian B. mayonii infection? (2) What is responsible for the high-level spirochetemia that occurs during B. mayonii infection, but not during B. burgdorferi infection? and (3) What antigenic proteins are produced during B. mayonii infection, but not during B. burgdorferi infection, that can be used for diagnosis of this emerging disease? Results from our studies will provide valuable insight on the pathogenic properties of B. mayonii and lay important groundwork for diagnosis and treatment."
"9354370","ABSTRACT Despite the high prevalence of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa, cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in this region. Predictors of CVD are well-established in resource-rich countries, but whether these same risk factors are strongly associated with CVD in sub-Saharan Africa is not known. Growing evidence from the US and Europe suggests that HIV itself may be a risk factor for CVD, through a combination of medication side effects, inflammation and immune activation, but how HIV disease and treatment impacts CVD risk in Kenya and other countries with generalized HIV epidemics is less well studied. The overall goal of this proposal is to determine the prevalence of traditional and non-traditional risk factors for CVD in HIV-infected and uninfected men and women in western Kenya. Metabolic risk factors include hyperlipidemia, glucose intolerance and obesity, which when taken together define a metabolic syndrome (MetS) that has been associated with myocardial infarction and stroke in high-income countries. This will be the focus of the first aim. In the second aim, we determine prevalence and predictors of chronic inflammation and immune activation, comparing risk factor prevalence among HIV-infected and uninfected and defining contributions of high HIV RNA levels, antiretroviral use, and other HIV-specific risk factors among those with HIV. In our third aim, we define rates of subclinical atherosclerosis among these Kenyan adults using high resolution ultrasound to measure carotid intima media thickness (C-IMT). Our multidisciplinary team from the University of Washington (UW), University of Nairobi, Kenyatta National Hospital and the Kenya Ministry of Health will conduct this cross-sectional study of 600 participants, 300 of whom will be HIV-infected, in a part of Kenya where >10% of the adult population is infected with HIV. We will leverage 30 years of experience doing research and training in Kenya, and 10 years implementing studies in the Kisumu District Hospital and surrounding community, to identify young and middle aged individuals with CVD risk factors and abnormal C- IMT. HIV-infected men and women >30 years old will be recruited from HIV clinics and uninfected participants at voluntary HIV testing sites and through outreach to partners. During a single follow-up visit, an interview, blood draw, and carotid ultrasound will be performed; assays will be conducted at a local research laboratory (glucose, lipids) and UW (Interleukin-6, highly sensitive C-reactive protein). This exploratory R21 application is innovative in its use of new technologies to assess C-IMT in HIV-infected and uninfected Kenyans. It will lay a solid foundation for expanding our established research infrastructure into research on CVD and non- communicable diseases by significantly advancing our understanding of subclinical atherosclerosis and how risk is modulated by HIV, metabolic risk factors, inflammation and immune activation. These data will be critical to developing targeted, feasible intervention trials to combat CVD in sub-Saharan Africa over the next decade."
"9277661","RESOURCE PROJECT - PROJECT SUMMARY A comprehensive knowledge of the location, structure, and expression of genes in the human genome is central to the understanding of human biology and the mechanisms of disease. Similarly for mouse, a comprehensive high quality gene set will aid in the design of experiments, and the interpretation of the effects of gene knockouts and resulting phenotypes, and as a model for human disease will help inform human gene function. The GENCODE consortium has assembled a team of world experts in a variety of fields related to gene annotation to create and distribute this gold standard. GENCODE's wide expertise covers gene and transcript isoform identification, pseudogene evolution, sequence conservation, gene expression, proteomics and post-translational modifications, gene regulatory elements, development and maintenance of the infrastructure required to create genome annotation at scale, and demonstrated community engagement and leadership. The complete and accurate annotation of the human and mouse genomes is necessary as many of the protein-coding genes are still incomplete or misannotated. GENCODE also aims to include all non-protein-coding genes which remain poorly understood with many loci still missing. Beyond the coding and non-coding genes, GENCODE creates reference pseudogene annotation as recent studies indicate that pseudogenes can play key regulatory roles. The completion of the full first-pass manual annotation of the reference mouse genome assembly will therefore be one of the main objectives of GENCODE. Efforts are underway in the Genome Reference Consortium (GRC) to expand the definition of the reference human genome to include genomic sequence for all haplotypes and gene alleles. GRC have already committed to supporting the genomes of a collection of 16 representative mice strains, thus effectively replacing the linear genome with a ?graph-like? structure of 16 separate haplotypes. GENCODE already annotate the full reference genome for human and mouse, including all available alternate sequences. GENCODE will continue to provide annotation appropriate to these new genomic sequences. In addition to genomic mutations that impair gene product function, many phenotypes are caused or moderated by the regulation of gene products. Therefore, GENCODE's complete annotation of all transcript isoforms logically includes key regulatory regions that are fundamentally a part of each gene and GENCODE will pilot the annotation of these tissue-specific regions."
"9385018","PROJECT SUMMARY In this application we propose a novel cellular therapy after autologous hemopoietic stem cell transplant (ASCT) for HIV related lymphoma (HRL) targeting multiple HIV antigens (gag, pol and nef) with the goal of depleting persistent HIV infection. In addition, we will also infuse T cells targeting EBV lymphoma associated antigens (LMP1, LMP2, EBNA1, BARF1) if the lymphoma is EBV positive. Investigators in both centers in this consortium have developed and optimized strategies to target EBV antigens which have shown promising results when infused post autograft to immunocompetent individuals with EBV+ lymphoma. More recently we have developed immunotherapy strategies to target HIV and in an ongoing study have safely infused autologous HIV specific T cells to HIV+ individuals with the goal of eradicating the virus reservoir. As antiretroviral therapy does not eliminate HIV in viral reservoirs and HIV+ individuals with lymphoma remain immunologically impaired we hypothesize that we can take advantage of the lympodepleted environment post ASCT to infuse autologous HIV specific T cells in a milieu that will promote expansion and persistence. Moreover, as nearly half of HRLis EBV positive we will infuse EBV specific T cells in this cohort with the goal of reducing the risk of relapse. In Aim 1 we will conduct a two arm Phase II clinical trial in which we will give HIV specific T cells to patients with HIV lymphoma early post autograft to all patients and will also give autologous EBV-specific T cells to patients with an HRL that is EBV+ve. In Aim 2, we will delineate the persistence and the anti-viral effects of the adoptively transferred T cells. The results of this study will inform approaches to eradicate the HIV reservoir and enhance immune function in patients with HIV related lymphomas. This strategy requires a multicenter trial due to the incidence of HIV lymphoma and our proposal is feasible since CTN has previously conducted a study of autograft in HIV lymphoma. Furthermore, our centers have extensive experience developing, implementing and completing complex biological therapies with cell and gene therapy products and have successfully sponsored and implemented over 100 cell and gene therapy studies under more than 50 investigator initiated INDs, including Phase II multicenter studies."
"9328883","Project Summary The prevalence of low bone mass diseases, such as osteoporosis, is growing each year as the baby boomer generation ages. Better anabolic and/or anti-catabolic agents to combat this problem are needed. The mechanical loading environment in bone plays a crucial role in bone mass. One key molecular pathway in the bone response to mechanical load is Wnt signaling. The Wnt co-receptors Lrp5 and Lrp6 are involved in regulating bone development and maintaining bone mass, and while Lrp5 is known to be necessary for mechano-response, it is unclear if Lrp6 is involved specifically in mechanotransduction. Additionally, the function of the intracellular downstream mediator of Wnt signaling, ?-catenin, in the mechanical response is not well defined. This proposal aims to address (1) the role of osteocytic Lrp6 in bone mechanical signaling and (2) the susceptibility to disuse-induced bone loss following constitutive activation of ?- catenin in osteocytes. To test aim 1, mice will be induced at 16 weeks of age for osteocyte -specific Lrp6 deletion and will be subjected to mechanical load by ulnar loading. Four weeks later, ulna will be analyzed for bone formation parameters by dynamic histomorphometry. It is hypothesized that these Lrp6- deficient mice will remain fully responsive to mechanical load, although mice with deletion of Lrp5 do not respond to mechanical loading. In aim 2, mice with inducible osteocyte-specific ?-catenin gain-of-function will be subjected to disuse. Following induction of ?-catenin activation at 12 weeks of age, mice will be subjected to disuse by a muscle paralysis model (botox) or tail suspension. Following 4 weeks of disuse, bones will be analyzed for changes in bone mass and bone formation rates. Gene transcription changes by RNAseq will provide novel insights into the pathways altered by disuse in bone. It is hypothesized that constitutive activation of ?-catenin in osteocytes will protect mice from disuse-induced bone loss, unlike their wild-type counterparts. Characterization of these molecules in the response of bone in increased loading or disuse situations will lead to better understanding of the role of the Wnt pathway in loading and the potential for new drug therapies for osteoporosis and other low bone mass diseases."
"9360102","Abstract The field of neuroscience is experiencing unprecedented growth in the ability to record from and manipulate brain circuits in humans and in animal models. MEG/EEG are the leading methods to non-invasively record human neural dynamics with millisecond temporal resolution. However, it is still extremely difficult to interpret the underlying cellular and circuit level generators of these `macro-scale' signals without simultaneous invasive recordings. This difficulty limits the translation of MEG/EEG finding into novel principles of information processing, or into new treatment modalities for neural pathologies. As such, there is a pressing need, and a unique opportunity, to bridge the `macro-scale' single with the underlying `meso-scale? cellular and circuit level generators. This problem is ideal for neural modeling where we can have specificity at both scales. We propose to build a user-friendly GUI driven neural modeling software tool, ?Human Neocortical Neurosolver (HNN)? that enables researchers without mathematical or neural modeling experience to test and develop hypotheses on the cellular and circuit level origin of their source localized MEG/EEG or ECoG data. Our software will work from a foundation of detailed anatomical and biophysical constraints to generate hypotheses as to the neural origin of observed neocortical brain signals. We will work with identified test-case users with existing MEG/EEG data to develop our model into a tool they can use to test and develop specific hypotheses on the neural origin of activity from one or multiple brain areas. We will also integrate the model with the source localization software MNE, so researchers can compute MEG/EEG source estimates and test hypotheses on the neural origin of their data in one integrated software package. We will build resources for freely using and expanding the software through the Neuroscience Gateway Portal, and online documentation and a user forum for interaction between users and developers."
"9319885","ABSTRACT ? Overall (Sallie Permar, PI; Duke University) Almost 2 million children are infected with HIV worldwide, and every year more than 150,000 new pediatric HIV infections occur. Postnatal breast milk transmission accounts for at least half of these new infections. Current standard of care commits HIV-infected children to lifelong, daily antiretroviral treatment (ART). A cure is needed to provide HIV-infected children a life without the medical complications, pharmacological burden, and social stigma associated with HIV-1 infection. While early initiation of ART leads to prolonged virus suppression, the virus rebounds after treatment cessation due to the persistence of virus reservoirs. However, there is hope that strategies to reduce or eliminate virus reservoirs could lead to long-term remission, as demonstrated by the over two-year ART-free remission that was demonstrated in the case known as `the Mississippi baby'. Using a highly relevant animal model, the overall goal of our Program is to define the origin, kinetics, and predictors of viral rebound in postnatally-infected infants, as well as assess the potential impact of immune-based interventions to eradicate pediatric HIV reservoirs. Our central hypothesis is that the origin and kinetics of viral rebound in postnatally infected infants can be predicted through biomarker measurement (Project 1) and can be extended through the enhancement of antiviral humoral and T cell immunity (Project 2). Specifically, we will use a highly translational animal model of pediatric HIV infection and long-term ART treatment to accomplish the following Specific Aims: 1) Define the origin, kinetics, and predictors of viral rebound following long term ART treatment in our animal model of postnatal infection; 2) Define the impact of passive immunization with broadly-neutralizing antibodies and T cell-based vaccine on viral rebound in our animal model of postnatal infection; and 3) Develop a mathematical model that will define the primary contributing factors and the potential efficacy of immune-based interventions on viral rebound following postnatal infection. Successfully completed, this Program will use our highly translational animal model to uniquely define the tissue origin, kinetics, and viral sequences of viral rebound, guiding development and evaluation of pediatric-specific HIV cure strategies; define biomarkers that can be used to clinically predict viral rebound; and evaluate the impact of immune-based interventions on viral rebound. Together, these results will help guide the design of passive and active vaccine strategies to achieve long-term remission or cure in human infants."
"9385354","ABSTRACT The Blood and Marrow Transplant Program at the University of Michigan (Ann Arbor, MI) has made major scientific contributions to the BMT CTN over the past 15 years. The University of Michigan is now partnering with Indiana University (Indianapolis, IN) and the Karmanos Cancer Institute (Detroit, MI) to participate as a Core Clinical Consortia for the BMT CTN Network. Collectively, our 3-member consortia currently perform over 750 transplants/year, including 300+ allogeneic and 85 pediatric transplants annually. Our consortia has a strong emphasis in non-malignant disorders, with over 1500 patients with sickle cell disease currently followed at consortium sites, and 46 transplants for sickle cell disorders collectively performed to date. Our consortia is likewise strong in pediatric disorders, with each site affiliated with a Children's Hospital on their respective campus. We have a track record for translating early phase, clinical trials to multicenter studies, have comprehensive biorepositories as foundations for our programs, and have physician scientists (Dr. Pavan Reddy, Dr. Hal Broxmeyer, Dr. Sophie Paczesny) with a history of academic success. Our research strategy will propose a new paradigm, one that focuses on the inhibition of damage response pathways as a potential mechanism to prevent the organ toxicity associated with conditioning and GVHD. The release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) from non-specific host tissue injury is a consequence of pre-HCT conditioning. DAMPs provide crucial initiating signals that lead to activation of antigen presenting cells (APC), triggering potentially lethal inflammatory responses. Based upon pre-clinical work from the laboratory of Pavan Reddy (PI: Scientific Lead), and a pilot study currently being run at consortia sites, we are now proposing a randomized, placebo controlled trial of a damage response modifier, CD24Fc, in unrelated donor transplant recipients. Due to its long half-life, the agent is only required to be given only once during transplant, on day -1 pre-transplant. The primary endpoint will be day 100 acute GVHD. Secondary endpoints will examine the effect of CD24Fc administration on DAMP's dependent inflammatory signaling post-HCT. We anticipate that this trial will not only mitigate the onset and severity of GVHD in recipients, but will advance our understanding of the biology and clinical importance of regulating key damage response pathways after HCT. Our consortia is committed to advancing the scientific agenda of the BMT CTN, and feel this research strategy will provide new insights into reducing both GVHD and regimen related toxicities associated with HCT. Our three centers are not just close in geographic proximity, but are closely aligned to address key transplant issues within the CTN."

"9319887","ABSTRACT ? Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Core (Core 1, Leader: Dr. Guido Silvestri, Yerkes National Primate Research Center, Emory University) The most appropriate animal model to define the origin, kinetics, and impact of humoral and cellular immune- based strategies on viral rebound in infants following postnatal HIV-1 infection and treatment is simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)/simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV) infection of rhesus macaques. Indeed, this model is particularly well-suited for our proposed studies because pediatric models of postnatal transmission have been developed and used to define the pathogenesis of infant HIV-1 infection and prevention strategies. However, NHP studies require extensive infrastructure and unique expertise. Thus, we the Program's Nonhuman Primate (NHP) Core (Core 1) will coordinate and implement all the NHP experiments proposed by the Program's two Projects: Project 1: ?Origin and predictors of viral rebound in infants?, (PI: Dr. Ann Chahroudi, Emory University), and Project 2: ?Impact of immune-based intervention on viral rebound in orally SHIV-infected infant monkeys? (PI: Dr. Genevieve Fouda, Duke University). The Core will support the Program through the following Specific Aims: Aim 1 - Organize, coordinate, and conduct studies of infant SHIV reservoir and rebound; Aim 2 - Administer and monitor antiretroviral treatment (ART) in orally SHIV-infected infant monkeys; and Aim 3 - Perform pharmacokinetic analysis of polyclonal antibody infusions in infant macaques to determine the dose and administration interval for treatment of infant SHIV infection. Led by Dr. Guido Silvestri, the NHP Core will ensure the following that are essential to the successful completion of these projects: 1) adherence to regulatory procedures relevant to research with NHPs; 2) coordination and implementation of all animal-related procedures, including housing, immunizations of infants, nursery-rearing of infants, antiretroviral treatments, and sample collections for weekly viral load measurement and monthly blood counts; 3) proper storage and/or shipment of samples to the Projects and Cores; and 4) maintenance of a database of clinical health parameters. Dr. Silvestri will ensure all NHP supported research efforts are tightly integrated and that evolving needs of the research projects will be met. As an integral component of this Program, the NHP Core will provide critical support to achieve the shared goals of understanding the source, kinetics, and impact of immune interventions on HIV-1 rebound in postnatally infected infants.  "
"9323181","Project 3 - QUANTITATIVE METHODS RESEARCH PROJECT - Abstract Over the past three decades, there have been great advances in HIV research, especially in diagnostics and treatment. Curing HIV will require further advances, particularly in the development of new agents and methods for evaluating incremental improvements in their contribution to cure. Our proposed Revealing Reservoirs during Rebound (R3) program will use a large battery of new technologies to investigate how HIV persists in and populates reservoirs throughout the body. Such new insights will be crucial in developing strategies aimed at curing HIV. To make maximal use of existing and newly generated data requires parallel advances in quantitative methods; hence, we propose a Quantitative Methods Research Project (RP). This RP will maximize the utility of data and samples collected in the overall program through the development of novel approaches for their analysis. The aims of our Quantitative Methods RP include: Aim 1: Discover biomarkers that can predict viral rebound when antiretroviral therapy (ART) is stopped to help guide future curative strategies. Aim 2: Precisely characterize HIV populations in T cell subsets and throughout the body and the impact of treatment interruption and re-initiation on these viral populations. Aim 3: Determine immune mechanisms by which HIV populations persist during ART by measuring biological quantities associated with viral rebound dynamics after stopping ART, and HIV population dynamics in cellular subsets and anatomic compartments. Aim 4: Create a global host model that uses mechanistic and empiric modeling methods to integrate our observations from viral rebound dynamics, HIV population of T cell subsets and tissues, and immunologic and virologic quantities to better understand the HIV in the body and the factors that sustain HIV persistence during ART and contribute to viral rebound when ART is stopped. The successful completion of these aims will provide the analytical framework to better understand the mechanistic underpinning of how HIV persists in the setting of ART, and what factors may be attractive targets to disrupt this viral persistence."
"9307873","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Here we propose to establish a National Center for Functional Glycomics (NCFG) that is focused on 5 major objectives; Technology Research and Development (TR&D); Driving Biomedical Projects (DBPs) tied to TR&D Projects; Collaborative Services; Training; and Dissemination of Technologies and Research Discoveries. The development of this application is an outgrowth of the very successful leadership provided by the Glycomics Center at Emory University School of Medicine, which housed the Protein-Glycan Interaction Core (Core H) of the successful Consortium for Functional Glycomics (CFG), a unique NIGMS-funded resource from 2001-2011 that has been utilized by hundreds of investigators worldwide. The Center's applications of the CFG's Defined Glycan Microarray, which has received >800 requests for analyses in the past 8 years, has revolutionized studies on protein-glycan interactions. Defined glycan microarrays have become the benchmark in studying the glycan-binding specificity of lectins, antibodies, and viruses, which for this grant application are termed glycan-binding proteins (GBPs). The value of immobilized glycans in studying GBPs and functional glycomics is evidenced by the collaborations already established in the Center with over 600 Principal Investigators worldwide, resulting in >350 peer-reviewed publications in the past 8 years. Over the past several years, the members of the Glycomics Center at Emory, who are the lead investigators in this proposed NCFG, have provided innovative leadership in developing technologies for studying the functions of cellular glycomes and for glycomic analyses. In the 3 TR&D Projects proposed for this NCFG, we will 1) expand glycan microarray technologies, 2) develop Shotgun Glycomics as a general method for studying natural cell-derived glycan recognition, and 3) develop different glycan display technologies, as well as cellular avatars - particles that represent cellular glycomes in unique presentations. The DBPs include studies on the roles of glycans in microbial and viral infections, glycans and GBPs in cell adhesion, innate and adaptive immune responses, and recognition factors within the glycocalyx that contribute to GBP interactions. The NCFG will use these advances to drive a strong Collaborative Service component to aid the biomedical research community in the using and developing of glycan microarrays and other approaches to explore glycan recognition. We will offer a robust Training program, as well as initiate multiple venues and strategies to Disseminate the technological and scientific developments in the NCFG."

"9354187","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal describes a three-year training program to develop an independent research career in endocrine physiology. The candidate is an instructor and attending in pediatric endocrinology at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), with an M.D.-Ph.D. in molecular and cell biology. He extended his training engaged in intensive translational research supported by the Department of Pediatrics Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (T32), the Pediatric Endocrine Society (PES) Research Fellowship and the Endocrine Society Clinical Scholars Award and is currently supported by the Division of Endocrinology and Diabetes Career Development Award in Pediatric Diabetes Research (K12), a career development award from the Clinical Practice Enhancement and Anesthesia Research Foundation and the PES Clinical Scholar Award. The proposed research will enhance our understanding of vitamin D metabolism and physiology. Vitamin D insufficiency is common and is thought to reflect insufficient sunlight-dependent synthesis or intake of vitamin D. Low 25-hydroxyvitamin D (calcidiol - 25(OH)D) reduces bone mineralization and impairs calcium and phosphorus homeostasis and is associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, type 1 diabetes and early mortality. 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D is believed to occur only in the liver through a constitutive enzymatic process. Recent studies, however, suggest the existence of extrahepatic CYP2R1 expression, and I have recently described regulation of liver CYP2R1 expression and activity in aged and obese mice. These results raise three intriguing possibilities with important implications: 1) 25-hydroxylation is regulated, which would provide a mechanism whereby some conditions alter serum 25(OH)D independent of supply; 2) common variation in the CYP2R1 gene gives rise to heterogeneity in 25-hydroxylase activity, which would explain variation in individual supplementation response; and 3) there is physiologically relevant CYP2R1 outside the liver, thus, non-hepatic diseases may affect 25(OH)D in unpredicted, tissue-specific ways. This work will examine these possibilities. This proposal will address critical gaps in our understanding of vitamin D homeostasis, specifically the heretofore unrecognized dynamic regulation of 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D by CYP2R1, and the potential role of the testis as an auxiliary organ for production of 25(OH)D. Additionally, these studies address the unmet need to identify patients at greatest risk of developing disorders related to low 25(OH)D at an early stage using genetic profiling rather than biochemical screening. In sum, the proposed studies and training plan build on the applicants previous work, leverage an optimal infrastructure for training in vitamin D physiology and pathophysiology and bioinformatics, and offer a clear mentored path for continued transition to independent research. The proposed research will be carried out under the mentorship of Michael A. Levine, M.D. and Hakon Hakonarson M.D., Ph.D. Dr. Levine is a leader in the field of vitamin D physiology and is a professor of Pediatrics and the director of The CHOP Bone Health Center (BHC), which includes a substantial research arm. Dr. Hakonarson is a world leader in dissecting the genetic contributors to disease and is an Associate Professor of Pediatrics and the head of the Center for Applied Genomics (CAG). They have each mentored numerous successful Postdoctoral fellows. An advisory committee of talented and invested clinician-scientists has been assembled to guide career development and science. The environment of CHOP, Penn, the BHC and the CAG provides extensive resources and intellectual expertise. This is an ideal training setting to develop the skill set to continue the transition to an independent career as a physician-scientist."
"9434015","Project Summary/Abstract The intensity of oral cancer pain is higher than other cancers. Quality of life for oral cancer patients is the lowest of all cancer patients because uncontrolled pain interferes with necessary oral functions including eating, talking and swallowing. Exogenous opioids are minimally effective for this type of pain and have significant side effects. Our long-term goal is to develop an effective and safe treatment for oral cancer pain. We recently demonstrated that OPRM1 (the gene for the µ-opioid receptor) is methylated and down regulated in oral cancer compared to matched normal tissues in the same patients; these patients reported pain at the site of cancer. We further demonstrated that OPRM1 re-expression with viral transduction significantly reduced cancer pain in a mouse model. Expression of the µ-opioid receptor on the cancer led to the secretion of opioids into the cancer microenvironment. Drawbacks of a viral transduction approach are that viral gene delivery has safety concerns and limited carrying capacity. To overcome these barriers we developed two non-viral hybrid vectors. The first is composed of a cell-permeable peptide (HIV-1 Tat peptide sequence modified with histidine and cysteine residues) combined with a cationic lipid. The second vector substitutes cationic polymer for the lipid. The vectors have excellent transfection efficiency with minimal cytotoxicity in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, the non-viral vectors preferentially transfects oral cancer cells compared to normal cells. Based on our preliminary work we hypothesize that re-expression of the OPRM1 gene within oral cancer using our non-viral vectors will attenuate cancer pain and restore orofacial function without excessive toxicity. In Specific Aim 1 we will d etermine the efficacy of ex vivo OPRM1 gene transfer with non-viral vectors to attenuate cancer-induced pain. Our goal is to move our method of non-viral transfection to the clinic. We foresee clinicians directly inoculating our non-viral vector into an oral cancer. Therefore, in Specific Aim 2 we will determine the feasibility and efficacy of in vivo OPRM1 gene transfer (i.e., directly into the tongue cancer) with non-viral vectors for attenuation of cancer-induced pain. Because our prerequisites for a clinical trial are toxicity and safety studies in Specific Aim 3 we will analyze toxicity and immune response in the cancer mice treated with non-viral OPRM1 gene delivery. The proposed research is significant because we will use a local delivery technique directly into the cancer to reduce the potential side effects of systemic drugs. Our approach is innovative because we will transduce the cancer cells for the treatment of cancer pain. facilitate the development of an effective therapy to treat cancer pain. Ultimately, these studies might"
"9295259","Project Summary/Abstract I am a clinician-scientist committed to performing high quality research on the causes, treatment and prevention of musculoskeletal diseases. As physical therapist with PhD training in orthopaedic biomechanics, I have rigorous training in the evaluation and treatment of how people move in order to reduce tissue injury and pain. An emerging field of research indicates that changes in the central nervous system (CNS) contribute to pain in patients with orthopaedic injuries, such as tendinopathy. Yet the current standard of care for Achilles tendinopathy does not evaluate or treat CNS pain mechanisms. We propose 2 independent studies to test how altered processing within the CNS contributes to chronic Achilles tendinopathy (AT) pain. K99 phase study: Specific Aim 1.1 compares measures of altered central processing in patients with chronic AT to adults without chronic pain; Specific Aim 1.2 determines which indicators of altered central processing persist after a local anesthetic injection eliminates peripheral nociception at the site of AT pain in patients with chronic AT. R00 phase study: Specific Aim 2.1 examines if the addition of pain education to an exercise program for AT is more effective at reducing pain and disability than exercise alone using an randomized controlled trial (RCT) design; Specific Aim 2.2 determines which indicators of altered central processing are improved by the addition of pain education to an exercise intervention. The University of Iowa is a research-intensive university that facilitates my ability to obtain mentorship from leaders in the field of pain research, to collaborate with experts in clinical care and biostatistics, and to work within an academic medical center to facilitate recruitment and data collection. The short-term goals for the K99 phase of this career development award are two-fold: first, to obtain much-needed didactic coursework and experience in the evaluation of pain mechanisms; and second, is to obtain training in the design and conduct of a high quality RCT using an educational intervention in combination with exercise to treat chronic tendinopathy pain. To achieve these goals I have identified 4 key objectives: 1) Gain greater knowledge about the neurobiology of pain mechanisms; 2) Gain experience in the conduct and design of an RCT; 3) Learn about psychological factors that contribute to pain & develop a pain education intervention; and 4) Learn about and participate in statistical analysis of RCT data. The long-term goal for the R00 phase is to implement the RCT techniques learned during the K99 phase. Thus, this career development plan is designed to help me succeed in my career goal as a tenure-track professor in a top-ranked, research-intensive institution. Ultimately, I would like to perform research that can improve clinical care of individuals with chronic musculoskeletal pain, to translate this research to clinical practice, and to train future clinician-scientists."

"9411779","Abstract The current proposal employs a vaccine platform, originally developed for malaria, to elicit protective immunity to Zika virus infection. The novel vaccine platform employs fusion of the vaccine antigen to a series of virus-derived chemokine-like molecules to direct the vaccine antigen to the immature dendritic cells that initiate the adaptive immune response. This vaccine construct will be used in combination with the MF59 adjuvant, which has been approved for clinical use in pregnant women for other vaccines by the US FDA. In its initial iteration including the human-derived chemokine MIP3? (CCL20), this vaccine platform has proven to be remarkably effective at eliciting high concentrations of antibody and protective immunity in a malaria mouse model challenge system. To avoid use of human-derived products in the vaccine construct MIP3? will be replaced in the currently proposed studies with the viral chemokines, for which similar immune enhancing capabilities have been observed. Domain III of the Zika virus E protein, which lacks N-linked glycosylation sites, will be targeted because of the ease of its expression in bacterial expression systems. Initial studies will optimize the vaccine construct, ensuring proper conformation and evaluating the affinity and magnitude of antibody responses elicited in wild-type C57BL/6 mice receiving different vaccine dosing regimens. Subsequent studies will evaluate the maintenance of protective antibody concentrations over a six month period, using both in vitro PRNT assays and in vivo challenge systems. For longevity of protection studies, in vivo challenge will be performed evaluating the protective efficacy of passively transferred antibody in Irf-3, 5 and 7 triple knockout mice available at this institution, These mice, under 11 weeks of age, have been demonstrated to be susceptible to Zika virus infection."
"9492137","PROJECT SUMMARY Individuals with bipolar disorder often experience functional and cognitive decline, especially in late-life. An affected ?mood network? in the brain has been proposed in bipolar disorder, which includes many of the brain regions involved in affected processes. However, mechanisms underlying changes to this network are largely unknown. Evidence from studies of animals and peripheral markers in humans suggests a role of oxidative stress, an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species and availability of antioxidant defenses. Our preliminary data suggest reduced availability of antioxidant defenses in the anterior cingulate cortex in bipolar disorder, particularly in older adults. This project will take a lifespan and longitudinal approach to study brain markers of oxidative stress as they relate to brain function and decline in bipolar disorder. The central hypothesis is that reduced availability of antioxidant defenses in critical regions of the ?mood network? in later-life leads to alterations in brain activation and connectivity, and ultimately to cognitive and functional decline in bipolar disorder. The long-term goal of understanding the role of oxidative stress in the pathophysiology and trajectory of bipolar disorder may lead to the identification of critical periods for intervention or the development of novel treatments. The specific aims are: 1) to examine the relationship between bipolar disorder and oxidative stress in the brain in middle- and older-aged adults, 2) to assess oxidative stress in the brain as a mechanism underlying known functional brain alterations in bipolar disorder, and 3) to conduct a pilot study to explore changes in oxidative stress and its effect on the trajectory of bipolar disorder longitudinally. Having accomplished the specific aims, this project will result in a rich dataset that will support future studies integrating oxidative stress into a larger mechanistic framework for bipolar disorder across the lifespan."
"9308041","OVERALL: PROJECT ABSTRACT Although children comprise one-quarter of the US population, only 10% of ClinicalTrials.gov registered studies focus on child health-related clinical and translational research (CTR). The mission of the Clinical and Translational Science Institute at Children's National (CTSI-CN) is to address the barriers and serve as a hub within the CTSA Network that is focused on the promotion of child health CTR. Established in 2010, the inaugural CTSI-CN (CTSI-CN v1.0) was organized as a collaboration between Children's National Health System (CNHS) and its academic partner, The George Washington University (GW). Over the past four years, CTSI-CN v1.0 has positioned itself as an effective catalyst for child-health CTR around four major themes: 1) improving the health of children and their families; 2) developing novel treatment strategies for rare genetic diseases; 3) designing new devices for pediatric care; and 4) characterizing childhood precursors of disease along the lifespan. We have embraced many of the tenets recommended in the July 2013 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, specifically, developing multidisciplinary teams, providing cost-effective services and support for investigators, and streamlining processes that impact the effective conduct of CTR. The CTSI-CN is acknowledged locally as the hub for effective, high quality child health CTR and as a nurturing, integrated home for CTR team science. Nationally, the CTSI-CN has provided leadership in child health CTR, in both CTSA- and non-CTSA-linked consortia and steering committees. In the current proposal (CTSI-CN v2.0), we will continue to advance our vision and mission through innovative approaches and enhanced capabilities in our strategic themes. To this end, we have expanded our partnership to include Virginia Tech (VT) and its clinical partner, the Carilion Clinic. The goals of CTSI-CN v2.0, which will build on our established strengths, the lessons learned in CTSI-CN v1.0, and our new partnership with VT/Carilion (VTC), will also address the four NCATS strategic themes by: 1) developing a new generation of diverse, high quality child health-focused CTR investigators through innovative, inter-institutional educational, training, and mentoring programs (WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT); 2) creating innovative approaches and technologies to catalyze CTR, particularly in child-health, through novel cross-disciplinary and inter-institutional collaborations with multiple stakeholder communities (COLLABORATION AND ENGAGEMENT); 3) catalyzing the development, dissemination and evaluation of novel methods to enhance translational science, with a particular emphasis on the child-health CTR spectrum (METHODS AND PROCESSES); 4) enhancing quality and efficiency across the translational spectrum through a) the integration of a high quality diverse workforce, b) implementation of new methods and processes, and c) collaboration among the institutional partners and communities (INTEGRATION): and 5) providing leadership within the CTSA Network through multi-site collaborations and educational programs, with a particular emphasis on child-health CTR and outcomes (CTSA NETWORK)."

"9401976","Project Summary Chronic kidney disease is a public health problem affecting more than 20 million people in the US adult population, and is the 9th leading cause of death. Few drugs other than renin-angiotensin system inhibitors slow the progression of kidney disease, lower mortality rates, or improve quality of life among people. New strategies targeting the early stages of these underlying diseases are fundamentally important to improve outcomes and patient care. To catalyze the development of drugs that are safe and effective for treating kidney diseases, there is a critical need to be able to model human kidney diseases and injury in vitro during preclinical drug development. The complex multicellular architecture and unusual triad of physiological processes characterized by glomerular filtration, tubular secretion and tubular reabsorption, have often limited the ability of whole organism models to fully recapitulate the diversity and manifestations of human disease. Conventional two-dimensional human epithelial cell models do not accurately recapitulate kidney physiology or disease, and microfluidic flow is essential to kidney nephron structure and function, and is an essential component in recapitulating in vivo physiology and pathophysiology. We have developed a three dimensional flow directed ?kidney-on-a-chip? microphysiological system populated with human kidney cells, which has been extensively tested with functional characterization of key component structures of the proximal tubule and the peritubular microvascular network. We are also able to routinely obtain, isolate and characterize relatively pure primary cultures of multiple human kidney cell lineages. In addition, we have developed hydrogels consisting of decellularized human kidney cortical extracellular matrix, and demonstrated phenotypic differences when human kidney cells are grown in this matrix. In addition, we have recently incorporated the use of human pluripotent stem cells coupled with gene editing techniques into our MPS. Our platforms allow for precise control of cellular composition, extracellular matrix, and vascular and tubular geometry and flow. The goal of this application is to model important human kidney diseases and promote identification of safe and effective treatments. To achieve this goal, we have established a multidisciplinary investigative team with expertise in kidney physiology and pathology, cellular and molecular biology, systems pharmacology and toxicology, biomarker discovery and evaluation, biomedical engineering, microfluidics, matrix biology, genomics, computational biology, and biostatistics. If successful, ultimately in vitro models that recapitulate critical aspects of kidney physiological function, response to injury, and repair could contribute greatly to drug discovery and development, and could ultimately enable `virtual clinical trials' for candidate therapeutics."
"9352700","FUNDING OPPORTUNITY: Secondary analysis of existing databases in traumatic brain injury to explore outcomes relevant to medical rehabilitation (R21); RFA-HD-16-001 PI: COLANTONIO A PROJECT SUMMARY: Comorbidity is prevalent after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and across the spectrum of injury severity. It can be present at the time of injury, arise early after injury, or during hospitalization or inpatient rehabilitation. Long-term follow-up studies of individuals who had endured a TBI report that patients have numerous co-existing disorders. Nevertheless, our comprehension of the when (i.e., pre- or post-injury presentation), how (i.e., how the conditions affect the injured individual and their subsequent demand for health care services) and which (i.e., which comorbid conditions cause the greatest burden), with respect to excessive use of resources, functional outcomes, and all-cause mortality, remain unanswered. Larger population- based studies are necessary to address these research gaps. The proposed retrospective cohort study will utilize linked data of all patients with TBI diagnostic codes, derived from emergency departments (National Ambulatory Care Reporting System), acute care (Discharge Abstract Database), inpatient rehabilitation (National Rehabilitation System), community services and long-term care (Home Care Database), continuing care (Continuing Care Reporting System), and prescription data (Ontario Health Insurance Plan Claims Database) over a 10 year period. At least 35,000 acute care cases over a 10 year period form the basis of the longitudinal analysis. These data have undergone quality assessments and linkage by the Institute for Clinical Evaluation Sciences, a non-profit independent organization that carries out research to improve the effectiveness of health care services in Ontario, Canada. We hypothesize that acutely derived variables (i.e., age, intracranial injury, injury mechanism, injury severity, length of stay) ? currently the focus of most research efforts in TBI and comorbidity ? are not by themselves sufficient to accurately predict resource consumption, all-cause mortality, and functional outcomes in individuals with TBI, stratified by age and sex. We further hypothesize that an expanded set of factors and factor clusters including patient demographic, certain clinical (i.e., comorbid) disorders and social indices, will provide greater accuracy in predicting resource consumption, all-cause mortality and functional outcomes of TBI, and these clusters will be subject to change over time. This study of comorbidity in patients with TBI may lead to uncovering challenging multifaceted problems (i.e., frailty and patient complexity) that are currently not well defined but generally considered to be closely related to the presence of multiple comorbid disorders.

"9492447","New tools to selectively regulate neurons have revolutionized causal experimentation. Optogenetics provides an array of elements for specific biophysical control, while designer chemogenetic receptors provide a minimally invasive method to control circuits in vivo by peripheral injection. We have developed a strategy for selective regulation of activity in specific cells that integrates opto- and chemo-genetic approaches, and thus allows manipulation of neuronal activity over a range of spatial and temporal scales in the same experimental animal. Light-sensing molecules (opsins) are activated by biologically produced light through luciferases upon peripheral injection of a small molecule, which crosses the blood-brain barrier. Such BioLuminescence-driven OptoGenetics (?BL-OG?) is a minimally invasive method like chemogenetics, but one that leverages the full array of bioluminescent and optogenetic options. Importantly, BL-OG allows conventional fiber optic activation while at the same time providing chemogenetic access to the same sensors. This opens, in principle, the entire optogenetic toolbox for complementation by a chemogenetic dimension. Further, because different forms of luciferases use non-cross reactive luciferins, multiple distinct effects can be independently and conjointly controlled in the same animal. We demonstrated proof of concept for this technology by using fusion proteins that directly link Gaussia luciferase (GLuc) to opsins, creating luminescent opsins (luminopsin, LMO). Here, we describe our next steps to increase the benefit of this technology for the field. We will expand the range of BL-OG options, increase their potency, and systematically quantify BL-OG impact in vitro and in vivo. In Aim I, we will generate new luciferases with increased light emission and luciferase/luciferin pairs with non- overlapping substrates to allow multiplexing. In Aim II, we will develop an extended toolkit of luciferase-opsin combinations and test their efficacy in vitro. In Aim III, we will validate and quantify the efficacy of bioluminescence activation of neural circuits in vivo by and directly compare stimulation of LMOs versus fiber optics versus DREADDs. Reflecting the basic science and clinical importance of BL-OG and the expertise of the investigators, we will use defined networks in neocortex and thalamus targeted with viral vectors expressing activating and silencing LMOs and DREADDs. The overall outcome of our work will be the optimization and validation of a novel, highly flexible tool set for bimodal optogenetic and chemogenetic interrogation of neuronal circuits in living animals. The proposed work will give the neuroscience community new molecules and comparative data to aid in making an informed decision when choosing among the various tools that may meet their specific experimental needs."
"9335964","SUMMARY Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of preterm birth affecting 30% of infants with birthweights < 1000 grams. Recently, pulmonary hypertension (PH) and right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) have been recognized as complications in approximately 25% of infants with moderate or severe BPD. Once infants develop PH, little is known about how to treat them, and risk of morbidity and mortality is very high. One of the mainstays of BPD therapy is oxygen (O2), but supraphysiologic O2 concentrations in combination with mechanical ventilation increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, inducing significant vascular dysfunction in neonates. Potential key targets for ROS-mediated dysregulation in the pulmonary vasculature are involved in cGMP signaling - soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) and phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5). In the previous funding period, we utilized a mouse model of hyperoxia-induced lung disease and PH to demonstrate that hyperoxia-exposed mice develop significant pulmonary and vascular disease, characterized by alveolar simplification, fewer capillaries, small pulmonary arteries (PA) remodeling, and RVH. We demonstrated that hyperoxia rapidly decreased lung and PA soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) expression and activity and increased lung and PA phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE5) activity, leading to disruption of cGMP-mediated downstream signaling. Giving low-dose sildenafil, a PDE5 inhibitor, concurrent with hyperoxia prevented increased PDE5 activity, vascular remodeling, and RVH, but was unable to restore normal capillary density and alveolarization. In preliminary data for this proposal, we have demonstrated that another environmental stressor, intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) due to placental insufficiency, leads to a significant delay in alveolarization with decreased expression of a key lung growth factor, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), decreased sGC expression and activity, and impaired alveolarization. IUGR mice have an exaggerated phenotype with hyperoxia vs. appropriately grown mice with further decreased sGC expression and activity and impaired alveolarization. We hypothesize that both growth restriction and hyperoxia-induced mitochondrial ROS disrupt the critical sGC-cGMP signaling pathway, leading to impaired alveolarization and angiogenesis. We will utilize our established mouse model of hyperoxia-induced lung injury in combination with a novel model of IUGR to elucidate the molecular mechanism by which ROS and growth restriction disrupt sGC-cGMP signaling and lung development. These studies will provide the pathophysiologic, mechanistic framework to improve pharmacologic treatment of BPD infants with PH. We believe sGC is a key integrator for multiple signals that impact alveolarization and angiogenesis in the neonatal period. sGC stimulators such as riocinguat are approved in adults with PH and represent a novel and potentially immediate therapeutic option for BPD-PH infants if a rationale for their use can be demonstrated."

Tapan Ganguly, PhD, the Director of the DNA Sequencing Facility since 2003, has been appointed Director of the consolidated Core. The integration of the two Shared Resources provides more efficient access and clarity of technologies to Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) members. It also presents opportunities for enhancing the quality and the range of services with better coordination as well as maximizing resource utilization without duplication. A team of highly experienced and trained professionals under two Technical Directors provides a whole spectrum of genomic and molecular biological services. These services are essential to ACC members for studying the role of specific genes in normal or abnormal cellular processes found in cancer cells and tumors. Investigators are able to observe global gene expression pattern in a sample, and genetic variability in an unaffected or tumor genome. The Core offers sequencing service on two platforms, gold standard Sanger sequencing on ABI capillary sequencers, and semiconductor sequencing on Ion Torrent PGM and its upgrade, Proton. The capillary sequencers also enable microsatellite genotyping and fragment analysis. Whole genome and targeted molecular profiling are performed on multiple platforms. The Core supports quantitative RNA profiling on Affymetrix GeneChips, Luminex FlexMap 3D, Fluidigm BioMark HD, and ABI 7900 real-time PCR system while DNA profiling is available on Affymetrix SNP GeneChip, Fluidigm BioMark HD and ABI 7900. The molecular biological services include cloning, subcloning and targeting vector construction for gene targeting in mice. ACC members benefit from consultations and training available throughout their projects. The range of services along with the expertise of the Core Director facilitates gene discovery, functional characterization and other research questions to elucidate the molecular pathogenesis of human cancers. In addition, molecular profiling of DNA and RNA together with targeted sequencing of cancer genes can help ACC members in cancer diagnosis, subclassifications, risk prediction and selection of appropriate therapy. 117 ACC members used the Core in the reporting period (10/01/13- 09/30/14) representing 36% of the total Core usage. CCSG support accounts for 15% of the proposed Core budget with the remaining funding coming from chargebacks, grants/contracts and Institutional support. Additional Institutional support comes in the form of funding for equipment purchase."
"9352472","Summary ? Project 2 There is a need for improved treatments to terminate status epilepticus (SE) and increase survival following exposure to seizure-inducing chemical threat agents. There are two major classes of convulsant chemical threat agents: organophosphate (OP) anticholinesterases, including soman and diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), and GABAA receptor antagonists, including tetramethylenedisulfotetramine (TETS) and picrotoxin. The current standard of care treatment for chemical threat agent seizures is the benzodiazepine diazepam, but the benzodiazepine midazolam will likely be used in the future. These agents fail to terminate chemical threat agent induced SE in many situations, particularly when they are administered at delayed times after exposure, and they are not effective at preventing seizure-induced brain damage. In the initial project period, a mouse model of TETS-induced SE was developed. In addition, a rat model of DFP-induced SE was adapted to the laboratory. Diazepam and midazolam at doses equivalent to recommended human doses were partially active in the TETS SE model. However, allopregnanolone, a positive modulator of GABAA receptors, had superior activity in terminating TETS-induced behavioral and electrographic SE, particularly when administered at a delayed time. At effective doses, allopregnanolone did not cause marked sedation, motor impairment or adverse effects on blood pressure or respiration. Unlike other similar agents, allopregnanolone is uniquely suited for intramuscular administration via autoinjector. DFP-induced SE was not terminated by benzodiazepines or allopregnanolone. However, the combination of perampanel, a potent AMPA receptor antagonist, and allopregnanolone administered intramuscularly was highly effective in terminating DFP- induced behavioral and electrographic SE. It is hypothesized that a combination of allopregnanolone and perampanel would represent an effective and safe ?universal? treatment for chemical threat agent seizures. In the proposed research, studies will be conducted that are required for the lead compound allopreganolone to enter advanced development, including studies in conjunction with standard therapy as well as non-human primate pharmacokinetic and efficacy testing. Proof-of-concept data will be obtained for perampanel and the combination of perampanel and allopregnanolone. Testing will also be conducted of additional antiseizure agents identified in Project 1 to determine if they are superior to the candidate treatments. Efficacy and safety testing will be conducted in both male and female animals to assess sex differences; and safety tests will be conducted in young and aged animals. Project 3 will identify candidate anti-inflammatory treatments to mitigate the long-term consequences of chemical treat agent seizures. Project 2 will assess whether these treatments interact with the antiseizure treatments. The results from this project will permit the lead compound allopregnanolone to enter advanced development and an assessment of whether perampanel or another candidate antiseizure agent should become development leads."

The NASH CRN is poised to continue its major impact on the field and directly advance the mission of the National Institutes of Health to improve the health of the public."
"9385159","Project Summary  The discovery of the single gene (CFTR) responsible for cystic fibrosis (CF) has been transformational in focusing treatment efforts on the development and approval of drugs that restore the function of the CFTR protein. Excellent clinical response for CF patients with ?gating? mutations is observed following treatment with the CFTR modulator drug ivacaftor (VX-770); however, for the remaining ~95% of patients, no effective treatments exist. More than two thousand different CFTR mutations, combined with other genetic and environmental factors, result in significant variability in response among individuals to a single therapy. To improve the clinical outcome for all CF patients, it is important that patient-specific in vivo features of CF are faithfully reproduced in vitro for predictive screening assays. To meet that need we have developed a novel organoid-based screening platform, Sphera?, using cells derived from a patient?s nasal epithelia. Sphera couples patient-specific organoids with an integrated assessment of CFTR function, including organoid morphology and viscoelastic characterization of luminal mucus using our proprietary microrheology analytics. In Phase I we developed the Sphera platform and validated its utility in measuring organoid response to CFTR rescue. During Phase II we will define the efficiency and sensitivity of the Sphera platform and scale it for high throughput use in a cross-sectional clinical study. A multi-disciplinary, industry-academic partnership with expertise in all areas essential to the successful accomplishment of these aims has been assembled, including investigators with expertise in microfluidics, advanced mathematics, CF lung physiology, and clinical studies. Sphera will be commercialized as a full service platform marketed to clinical and drug development clients. The primary endpoint of this work is to develop a novel tool with dual utility in both CFTR modulator development and precision treatment for individuals with CF."
"9477843","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) are the most widely used nonhuman primates in biomedical research. This species is critically important in efforts to understand the causes and potential new treatments for many human diseases. Rhesus macaques are a premier model organism for the study of the pathogenesis of HIV-AIDS, and for development of novel treatments and new vaccines against HIV infection. In addition, rhesus macaques are commonly used in studies of basic neurobiology, risk factors for psychiatric illnesses such as anxiety disorders and depression, metabolic diseases such as diabetes and osteoporosis, and reproductive biology. This project will dramatically increase the value and impact of this laboratory primate species for all types of biomedical research by generating a substantial amount of new information about genetic variation within the species. It is well established that genetic differences among people influence their risk of developing many, probably most, diseases including those listed above. Genetic variation can also influence the progression of disease and the responses of different people to a specific treatment. We will facilitate research concerning the genetic basis of disease susceptibility and response to treatment by identifying large numbers of new DNA sequence variants in functional genes and intervening sequences within the rhesus genome. To accomplish this, we will produce high-quality whole genome DNA sequence data for 433 rhesus macaques. The sequence data will be used to identify currently unknown DNA sequence variation present in this species, including single nucleotide variants, small indels, CNVs and other variants. The study subjects will be animals already characterized for one or more disease-related phenotypes, such as vaccine protection against SIV-AIDS, neurobiological traits, behavioral traits, metabolic disorders such as diabetes or polycystic ovary syndrome, and gastrointestinal diseases. By sequencing these animals, we will generate BOTH general information about variation across the macaque genome and specific information beneficial to the investigators who have phenotypically characterized these animals and contributed these DNA samples. All the data generated will be made publicly available through appropriate NIH and NPRC databases."
"9315550","PROJECT SUMMARY Protein translocation across lipid bilayers is a fundamental step in many biological processes, such as protein sorting and secretion in eukaryotic cells and delivery of cytotoxic components by pathogenic bacteria. Membrane-spanning proteins that translocate proteins and peptides are known as ?translocase channels.? The importance of the interaction between translocase channels and the membrane lipids that surround them as well as the molecular basis of protein translocation are poorly understood. The activity of many transmembrane proteins and protein complexes, including translocase channels, can depend on the presence of specific types of lipid in the membranes where they insert. Characterizing lipid recruitment to the vicinity of the channels holds promise for developing therapeutic drugs targeted at lipid-protein interactions, but studying the precise nanoscale lipid environment of membrane proteins can be exceptionally challenging with current methods. Likewise, elucidating the mechanisms by which translocase channels transport proteins, which may be much larger than the channel's pore, across membranes is of fundamental and therapeutic interest. Anthrax toxin, secreted by Bacillus anthracis, is a model translocation system that exhibits host cell lipid dependencies and functions by transporting ~90 kDa cytotoxic proteins through a pore that is only ~6-12 Å in diameter. The toxin's three components are known as protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF), and edema factor (EF). These toxins co- assemble on the host cell surface after binding to host cell receptor proteins and are then endocytosed via a cholesterol-dependent pathway. Acidification of the endosome causes the PA proteins to form a narrow aqueous channel across the endosomal membrane, and the enzymes LF and EF unfold, pass through the channel, and refold inside the cytosol, where they carry out their cytotoxic roles. It is unknown to what extent the channel recruits specific classes of lipids or how lipid-protein interactions affect its structure and function. Current models for LF translocation suggest that it proceeds via a Brownian ratchet-like or helix compaction mechanism, but many questions remain unanswered as to the crucial initial step of inserting unfolded LF or EF into the long, narrow pore. The lipid stoichiometry of lipid-protein Nanodiscs containing with anthrax lethal toxin and varied lipid composition will be determined using native ion mobility-mass spectrometry (IM-MS). After pH-induced insertion of LF into the PA pore within the Nanodisc environment, native IM-MS will be used to characterize changes in the size and shape of the intact complex. The preferred lipid environment of the pore and the intrinsic entropic barrier to LF insertion through the pore will thereby be elucidated. It is expected that the pore preferentially recruits raft-associated lipids and that LF translocation occurs via a large number of energetically competitive intermediate states. Relevance: Characterizing nanoscale lipid recruitment and entropic factors in the initial stages of translocation by anthrax toxin is relevant to development of targeted methods to inactivate the toxin and novel technologies that exploit translocase channels as sensors or drug-delivery tools."
"9309036","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The BARD clinical trial aims to determine the most appropriate add-on therapy for Black individuals who are not responding to low dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). This unique cohort offers repeated sampling across 4 treatment regimens and provides an opportunity to compare response in children and adults. Using samples obtained at baseline and following 4 treatment regimens, this ancillary study proposes to significantly augment clinical and genetic data from BARD with mechanistic information through quantitation of Th2, inflammatory, and resolving markers and through the use of complementary metabolomics techniques. We hypothesize that ICS-responsive individuals will have a Th2-high phenotype, reflected in increased IL4, IL13, IL5, IgE, and periostin. We have previously found a relationship between urinary leukotriene E4 (uLTE4) and asthma, and between sphingolipids and COPD. Therefore we will test the hypothesis that LTE4 and other pro-inflammatory molecules are increased in ICS- responsive individuals. Because asthma is a heterogeneous condition, knowing the dynamics of multiple molecules will be required in order to fully understand mechanism, and we will utilize an unbiased metabolomics approach to discover new markers. We expect that response to medication can be predicted based on the relative abundance of Th2, inflammatory, and other disease-related molecules and that levels will revert to normal levels in response to medication. Finally, we expect that groups of individuals will cluster based on mechanistic differences. Therefore, in specific aim 1 (SA1), we will quantitate Th2, inflammatory, and resolving markers and will perform metabolomics on baseline plasma, sputum (adults only), and urine samples. In SA2 we will develop prediction models, perform cluster analysis, and correlate results from sputum, plasma, and urine. In SA3 we will use longitudinally collected urine samples to determine the effect of increased ICS therapy on specific molecules. This high impact clinical study will provide an unprecedented opportunity to determine if plasma markers can be used to predict response to therapy, thereby answering urgent questions in clinical medicine."
"9383739","Project Summary Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is an autoimmune subepidermal blistering disease characterized by autoantibodies and an inflammatory infiltrate at the lesional site. BP autoantibodies belong to IgG and IgE isotypes and recognize two hemidesmosomal proteins, BP180 and BP230. These autoantibodies mainly target the NC16A extracellular domain of BP180. The dermal infiltrate contains eosinophils, neutrophils, mast cells, macrophage and lymphocytes, with eosinophils being the predominant cell type. The roles of anti-BP180 IgG autoantibodies and neutrophils in BP have been extensively investigated. In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that anti-BP180 NC16A IgG autoantibodies fix complement, recruit neutrophils and cause BP-like blisters. However, roles of anti-BP180 IgE and eosinophils in BP remain largely unknown. Lack of a suitable animal model is a major obstacle for studies of IgE and eosinophils because human IgE do not recognize mouse IgE receptors. Our lab currently developed a double humanized mouse stain (termed hFc?RI/NC16A mice), in which the human NC16A domain replaced the mouse counterpart NC14A domain and human Fc?RI are expressed on eosinophils and mast cells. More significantly, adult hFc?RI/NC16A mice injected with anti- NC16A IgE autoantibodies from BP patients develop BP skin disease that required eosinophils and mast cells. The objective of this proposal is to study the role of eosinophils and mast cells in BP using our newly developed hFc?RI/NC16A mouse model. The overall goal of this project is to increase our understanding of the innate immunity of BP and how it relates to the functions of innate immune system players in inflammation and autoimmunity. In this grant proposal, we will determine how eosinophils are recruited and functionally interact with mast cells (Aims 1 and 2). Proteolytic enzymes from these innate immune cells are critical for skin tissue injury, therefore, we will translate our animal model findings to human BP (Aim 3). Since this proposal integrates both disease mechanism studies and preclinical trials, the findings are expected to have a significant impact on the treatment of patients with BP."

"9355749","SUMMARY/ABSTRACT  Two out of three individuals living with HIV/AIDS worldwide reside in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Fortunately, due to a massive roll-out of potent combination Antiretroviral Therapy (cART), global rates of morbidity and mortality from HIV infection have declined significantly over the past decade. However, while the initiation of cART has led to a global decline in deaths from AIDS related opportunistic infections and malignancies, there has correspondingly been a surge in deaths from cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non- AIDS related cancers. In North American cohorts up to 10% of all deaths among people with HIV/AIDS have been attributed to CVD. The greater frequency of CVD complications among HIV patients is thought to be possibly due to HIV-stimulated endothelial activation, vasculopathies, opportunistic infections, neoplasia, prothrombosis, and metabolic derangements or cART directly causing immune activation and metabolic dysfunction that can accelerate systemic atherosclerosis. There is a striking paucity of data on the nature and contributors to CVD among HIV patients in SSA. Beyond the potential contributions of the virus or cART to CVD risk in HIV patients, enhancements in the socio-economic status of general populations in SSA has led to an increasing adoption of Western diets and lifestyles resulting in a growing epidemic of key CVD risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia. Information on the prevalence and predictors of co-existing CVD among HIV patients in SSA could permit the development of unique strategies to reduce CVD burden in these patients encountered in resource-limited settings. Currently, HIV patients cared for in SSA are not routinely or systematically screened/treated for CVD because of socioeconomic obstacles, cultural barriers, under- diagnosis, and a dearth of scientific information to guide providers. The overall objective of the Evaluation of Vascular Event Risk while on Long-term Anti-retroviral Suppressive Therapy (EVERLAST) study is to characterize the presence of CVD risk among 240 HIV subjects on cART in SSA (vs. 240 cART-naïve HIV patients and 240 HIV-uninfected subjects) and explore factors influencing it, while building sustainable capacity for a future intervention study across the lifespan in a resource-limited setting (Ghana). In EVERLAST, we will 1) assess the prevalence of CVD risk among HIV patients on cART for >1 year as defined by carotid intima media thickness, along with socio-econo-demographic factors, traditional CVD medical and lifestyle risk factors, HIV- related factors, and serologic indices; 2) we will obtain information and guidance about the barriers and facilitators influencing CVD risk management among HIV patients in SSA at the various levels of a social ecological model; and 3) based on data gathered from the earlier phases of the study, we will propose interventions at levels of the social ecological model to improve optimal CVD risk management of HIV patients on cART in SSA that can be tested in a future study."
"9327514","Project Summary/Abstract  Obesity poses a serious public health concern and has been identified as a risk factor for a variety of medical and psychosocial comorbidities. Thirty-five percent of college students have overweight/obesity and are in need of brief and simple weight loss interventions that complement their unstructured lifestyles. Implementation intentions, a widely-used strategy to pursue goals, facilitate goal-attainment for a wide variety of health-behaviors, including dietary change and weight loss, and may therefore be useful for dietary change and weight loss in college students; however, this has not been tested. A study is needed to evaluate an implementation intention intervention for dietary change and weight loss in this population. Additionally, little research has examined implementation intentions in naturalistic settings over time, which may weaken underlying mechanisms given strong environmental temptations and necessitate additional support. Fluency training of implementation intentions (i.e., training for speed and accuracy) and text message reminders over the course of an intervention should serve to improve encoding and retrieval, strengthening the underlying mechanisms of action of implementation intentions and thus enhancing intervention effects. Moreover, individuals with obesity have been shown to be low in working memory capacity (WMC), a moderator that may inhibit use of the skill. Therefore, fluency training and text message reminders meant to support encoding multiple intentions and monitoring multiple cues to prompt retrieval may be most beneficial for individuals low in WMC. Thus, this proposal aims to test the efficacy of an implementation intention intervention alone (IMP) and in combination with fluency training and text message reminders (IMP+) against a goal-intention control group (GOL) on self-regulatory weight loss behaviors. A three-group randomized-controlled intervention paradigm will be employed across four weeks. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA), which entails the repeated testing of participants in real time, will be used to provide an in-depth snapshot of implementation intentions use and their mechanistic role in behavior change during weeks 1 and 4 of the program. This will be the first study to examine implementation intention use with an externally-valid measurement tool. At post-treatment, weight and dietary change will be assessed. Students with overweight/obesity (n=75; ages 18-25) wanting to lose weight, but not currently enrolled in a weight loss program, will be assessed. This study is significant because it: 1) evaluates the use of a simple and effective transdisciplinary goal-striving strategy, alone and enhanced, for weight loss and diet change in college students with overweight/obesity, 2) considers cognitive moderators (i.e., WMC) that may interfere with intervention efficacy that are salient to individuals with obesity and identifies ways to attenuate their effect and, 3) provides the first examination of implementation intention usage in a naturalistic environment, to gain insight into the practical application of theoretical underlying mechanisms."
"9513102","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This application is the translational component of an overall UO1 application entitled, Novel therapies in alcoholic hepatitis - University of Louisvill. Alcoholic hepatitis (AH) has a high morbidity and mortality. In VA Cooperative Studies in which liver biopsies were performed, only 35% of patients with AH and underlying cirrhosis, and 60% of those with AH alone (no cirrhosis) were alive at the end of four years, with most deaths occurring early in the study. There is no FDA-approved therapy for any stage of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). The most widely-used (off-label) drug therapies for AH are glucocorticoids and pentoxifylline. Both agents have anti-inflammatory activities and downregulate proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Unfortunately, an important subset of AH patients treated with glucocorticoids have steroid resistance, and some patients have contraindications to steroid therapy. Studies on pentoxifylline in AH are limited, and efficacy appears highest in preventing/treating the hepatorenal syndrome. Thus, new therapies as well as a better understanding of mechanisms/biomarkers for severity of disease and response to therapy are necessary. Our research team has been a leader in defining mechanisms of alcohol-induced liver injury using in vitro and animal models of ALD, and in translating basic findings into the clinical setting. Our group is the first to describe dysregulated cytokine metabolism in AH. We have a long-standing interest in mechanisms of inflammation and liver injury. We also have extensive experience in the gut-liver axis and AH, as well as in the development of novel therapies for AH.!!Building on the above translational research strengths of our program which focus on the gut-liver axis and inflammation in ALD, we propose three highly translational Specific Aims, which all relate to and utilize samples from our proposed UO1 clinical trial. Aim 1 will evaluate novel mechanisms for alcohol-induced alterations in gut integriy leading to endotoxemia and AH. We will study the therapeutic efficacy of both live probiotics and probiotic supernatants. Aim 2 will study the role of specific PDE4 inhibition in AH using animal models and our AH clinical patient population. There are recent data in the pulmonary literature showing that specific PDE4 inhibitors are effective in steroid resistant patients which may translate to AH. Lastly, Aim 3 evaluates mechanisms for steroid resistance using both specimens from patients in our clinical trial and in vitro data. All three of our specific aims utiize specimens obtained from our U01 clinical trial, and our protocol interacts with the two other translational protocols in our U01 consortium.

The Na-K-Cl cotransporters, NKCC1 and NKCC2, are key elements of net transport in the mammalian renal epithelium: NKCC1 forms part of the final pathway of K+ secretion in the collecting duct, and NKCC2 is key in the process of NaCl reabsorption across the in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL) and distal tubule, where it is the site of action of diuretics such as furosemide. The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms that underlie the function and regulation of the Na-K-Cl cotransporters in the mammalian kidney. The proposed studies will be carried out with isolated renal tubules as well as with recombinant NKCC1 and NKCC2 protein expressed in the HEK cell expression system. Specifically: 1) We will elucidate the molecular structure of NKCC1, directly addressing ion and inhibitor sites in the translocation pore; we will discover the functional consequence of newly discovered rare human mutations in NKCC1 and NKCC2; and we will examine regulation of NKCC1 in the collecting duct during flow-activated K+ secretion. 2) We will determine the molecular mechanism of NKCC2, focusing on the role that TM2 plays in determination of ion binding kinetics and stoichiometry, and we will discover if intracellular [Cl-] is the signal underlying NKCC2 regulation in the TAL. 3) We will determine the molecular mechanism by which phosphorylation in the NKCC N-termini regulate transport conformational change in the transporter."
"9354201","Abstract: Daily administration of high doses of glucocorticoids is standard of care for the treatment of many pediatric inflammatory diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The side effect profiles of are severe, with stunting of growth, bone fragility, mood changes, and sleep disturbances, leading to a decrease in quality of life of children, and an increase in the costs of clinical care. In preliminary data from longitudinal studies of DMD patients, we describe validated panels of pharmacodynamic biomarkers for multiple aspects of safety, as well as anti-inflammatory efficacy of glucocorticoids. Our group, in collaboration with Reveragen biopharma, has also identified a dissociated glucocorticoid (VBP15) with powerful anti-inflammatory and membrane stabilizing activity that is highly effective in ameliorating disease phenotype in multiple inflammatory disease models including the dystrophin deficient mdx mouse. Phase 1 clinical trials of VBP15 in 88 adult volunteers have shown safety up to a 30-fold prednisone dose (20 mg/kg/day), with a relative loss of adrenal suppression, insulin resistance, and immune suppression. The overarching goal of this project is to bridge safety and efficacy biomarkers to clinical outcomes so that specific pharmacodynamic biomarkers can be used to facilitate the design and conduct of clinical trials in younger DMD patients, 1-4 years old, where clinical outcomes are poorly established. To achieve this goal we propose four specific aims 1). Bridge the novel putative safety and efficacy pharmacodynamic markers to clinical outcomes using the existing CINRG DNHS natural history data, and sample set from GC treated (pre and post) DMD patients; 2) define the differences in acute pharmacodynamics of GC vs. VBP15 using single dose PK/PD time series in both adult volunteers and DMD patients, 3) validate and qualify safety and efficacy biomarkers identified for GC and VBP15 treatment and 4) establish a Phase 2b clinical trial protocol for 1-4 yr old DMD children, with inclusion of both established and novel safety and efficacy biomarkers bridged to clinical outcomes in older children. This will set the stage for clinical trials of VBP15 and other anti-inflammatory drugs, where the data obtained is expected to enable more acute and objective readouts of drug action in pediatric patients using well-characterized and noninvasive pharmacodynamic biomarkers as outcome measures."

"9411043","PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Latent HIV reservoirs, primarily comprised of HIV-infected and long-lived subpopulations of CD4+ resting memory T cells are established during the earliest stage of infection. While currently available antiretroviral therapies (ART) can reduce the level of HIV in blood to an undetectable level, they cannot eliminate the latent reservoir, thereby imposing a major obstacle to curing the infection. A number of latency reversal agents (LRAs) has shown activity in vitro, but all have little or no impact on the latent reservoir in clinical trials to date. Because increasing the doses of LRAs is prohibitive in their current forms due to the potential for increased systemic toxicity, alternative strategies for the specific targeting and activation of the latent HIV reservoir are needed. We therefore propose to harness the exquisite specificity of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and to further increase their specificity through the construction of bispecific antibodies for targeting the HIV latent reservoir. We will engineer a panel of bispecific antibodies capable of targeting the narrow subsets of CD4+ resting memory T cells that have been characterized as the likely HIV reservoir cells in blood and tissues. We will then conjugate a panel of LRAs to each of the promising bispecific antibodies to deliver such agents preferentially to the latently infected cells. To evaluate the activity of all of our engineered bispecific antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs), we will take an iterative approach to assess binding affinity and avidity, selectivity of LRA delivery, and HIV activation from the latent reservoir in vitro or ex vivo. The ADCs with the most promising in vitro or ex vivo properties will be further evaluated for their impact on the latent reservoir in vivo using a humanized mouse model of HIV infection and treatment. The underlying hypothesis of the proposed studies is that the use of bispecific antibodies to concentrate LRAs in cell populations harboring latent HIV, while minimizing the exposure to cells that are virus free, could markedly increase the therapeutic index of LRAs by several orders of magnitude. We believe that our proposal offers a promising and novel strategy for highly specific and potent activation of HIV reservoir cells, and it is our belief that one or several of our engineered antibody drug conjugates could become a key component in a multi-pronged approach to eliminating the latent reservoir and curing HIV-1 infection."
"9478406","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Long-term hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are capable of self- renewal and differentiation into all mature hematopoietic lineages. Cell specific transcription factors interact with co-factors to orchestrate chromatin structure and facilitate gene expression. To generate a compendium of factors that establish the epigenetic code in HSCs, I completed first large-scale in vivo reverse genetic screen targeting chromatin factors. To accomplish this task, I designed antisense morpholinos for 488 zebrafish orthologs of conserved human chromatin factors and the resultant morphants were analyzed by whole embryo in situ hybridization at 36 hours post fertilization for expression of two HSC specific genes, c- myb and runx1. 25 morpholinos caused near complete knockdown of HSC marker expression and 4 were found to increase HSC marker expression. Of the morpholinos that alter formation, several genes known to be essential for HSC self-renewal and maintenance were identified. For example, knockdown of Mll or Dot1 fail to specify HSCs, as indicated by a reduction in expression of the HSC markers. Reduced expression of six polycomb family members results in a decrease in HSC marker expression. Many of the remaining hits represent factors with no previous function ascribed in hematopoiesis, though some are components of known chromatin remodeling complexes, such as the Hat1 and Hbo1 complexes. The Hbo1 complex binds to target loci through one of the complex members, Ing4, which recognizes H3K4me3 marks. Four members of the Hbo1 complex were hits in this screen and I have found that these factors genetically interact in zebrafish embryos. No role for this complex has been shown previously in HSCs. Ing4 has also been shown to negatively regulate NF-?B, tying the function of this complex to regulation of inflammatory signals in HSCs. This project will connect two important pathways, chromatin remodeling through acetylation and HSC response to inflammatory signals, offering new avenues to pursue in the study of histone modifications in HSCs and for therapeutic alternatives for patients with blood disorders. As a postdoctoral Research Fellow in Hematology/Oncology at the Children's Hospital Boston, Dr. Kathrein will perform her research project in the laboratory of Dr. Leonard Zon, a renowned hematologist, stem cell biologist, and zebrafish researcher. Building on her strong background of studying cell signaling mechanisms, Dr. Kathrein will expand her advanced scientific and technical knowledge to the regulation of hematopoietic cell specification determination using zebrafish as model organism. Under the mentorship of Dr. Zon and a prestigious mentoring committee, Dr. Kathrein has developed an ambitious research and training program that will equip her with highest research skills to ensure her success in the mentored and independent award period. The nurturing environment of the Children's Hospital Boston and the Harvard Medical School will provide the perfect surroundings for Dr. Kathrein's training to become a successful independent scientist."
"9305093","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant):  Although stem cell-based therapies can potentially be used to treat numerous prevalent diseases, their successful clinical translation requires overcoming the major roadblock of immune rejection. In addition, in autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes (T1D), where a breakdown in immune tolerance leads to the immune-mediated destruction of pancreatic insulin-producing cells, the underlying autoimmunity needs to be altered to allow successful engraftment without immunosuppression. Developing approaches to manipulate immune tolerance in the context of autoimmunity is thus essential for improving methods to cure and treat human autoimmune diseases. Within the immune system, the thymus plays a critical role in establishing central immune tolerance through the education of developing T cells. The thymus enforces tolerance through the deletion of T cells that recognize self-antigens and the production of potent regulatory T cells (Tregs) that can suppress immune responses. Given that self-identity is encoded by thymic epithelial cells (TECs), an appealing approach to manipulating immune tolerance in the context of stem cell therapies would be to reprogram the immune system through the generation of stem cell-derived TECs.  Recently, our group has developed a novel method to differentiate human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) into thymic epithelial progenitors (TEPs) that mature into functional thymic tissue upon transplantation into immunodeficient mice. Importantly, these hPSC-derived TEPs acquire characteristics of mature TECs that allow generation of functional T cells capable of mounting allogeneic immune responses as well as formation of Tregs that maintain immune tolerance through crucial inhibition of self-reactive T cells. This unique and highly innovative tool will now be used to establish novel humanized murine models that more closely mimic in vivo human immune responses. Humanized mice transplanted with hPSC-derived TEPs will be used to study engraftment of another stem cell derivative (pancreatic beta cells). Additionally, a model of T1D autoimmunity will be developed through the generation of islet-specific autoreactive T cells within the thymus. Indeed, by altering expression of antigens such as insulin in hPSC-derived TEPs, we will have an opportunity to modify the immune repertoire as well as potentially impact the development of Tregs specific to islets. This will allw us to examine the early stages of T1D in an animal model using human immune cells and targets. Finally, these humanized mouse models will be used to study the impact of manipulation of thymic function and Treg administration that have the potential to alter allogeneic and autoimmune responses to stem cell-derived grafts.  Taken together, our proposed studies will provide unique tools to enable improved studies of stem cell derivatives transplantation and modeling of autoimmune disorders such as T1D. Furthermore, our work will lay the foundation for the potential that thymic immune tolerance can be manipulated to improve engraftment of stem cell derivatives in the context of autoimmunity."
"9357645","Functional Genomics and Phenotyping Core (FGPC) Project Summary  Phenotypic characterization of animal models with induced genetic mutations is the most robust way to elucidate the in vivo functions of genes and the role of mutations in the pathogenesis of diseases. To date, generation of human disease models in mice has been facilitated by embryonic stem (ES) cell technology, routine transgenesis and mutagenesis. Our laboratory has had over 20 years of experience generating mice using ES cell as well as pronuclear injection. In this PPG, we propose to adopt the simple, fast and highly efficient genome editing tool CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats)/Cas9 system for RNA-guided DNA editing in a combined Mouse Mutagenesis Subcore. We will generate mice with null, point mutations, and conditional alleles to mimic genetic variants of Osteogenesis Imperfecta (OI) found in patients and/or generate alleles to test specific hypotheses related to the Projects in this Program Project Grant (PPG). Utilizing these mouse models, we will examine how variants contribute to quantity and quality of skeletal tissue by examining bone geometry, microarchitecture, and material composition. Importantly, the Core will leverage the infrastructure, expertise, and resources of the Baylor College of Medicine Knockout Mouse Phenotyping Project (KOMP2) (see Overview B.6.e) combined with the infrastructure of the Texas Medical Center (TMC) Bone Disease Program of Texas (BDPT) to achieve cost effectiveness and throughput (see Overview B.6.d). We will also establish a Mouse Skeletal Phenotyping Subcore. This sub-core will perform in phenotyping including microCT imaging, bone histomorphometry, and biomechanical and material study. To achieve this cost effectively, it will also leverage the infrastructure of the TMC BDPT (see Overview B.6.d). The Mouse Skeletal Phenotyping Subcore consists of two components. The MicroCT Imaging component will quantify and assess bone microarchitecture using standard resolution microCT imaging. In addition, the X-radia microCT system combines microCT with phase contrast optics to achieve ultra-high resolution of bone and other soft tissues. The Biomechanical and Tissue Property Analysis component will perform biomechanical assessments of bone, tendon and ligament strength and viscoelastic parameters to determine the material factors that contribute to tissue strength. The combination of these assessments will allow us to fully characterize the strength, plastic and viscoelastic properties of the tested tissues. Bone strength is also governed by the bone matrix and its mineral composition, which are altered in aging and disease. Raman spectroscopy (RS) will be utilized to analyze the content of bone mineral and organic matrix, which allows for concurrent evaluation of the material composition as well as mineral-matrix interactions. With these analyses, quantitative and qualitative information of the bone composition will be obtained. Collectively, these cores serve critical functions by integrating the generation of mouse models of human bone disease with providing systematic phenotype analyses."
"9319890","ABSTRACT ? Project 2 (Leader: Dr. Genevieve Fouda, Duke University) More than 1.8 million children world-wide live with HIV, and every year more than 150,000 new pediatric HIV infections occur. Current standard of care commits HIV-infected children to lifelong, daily antiretroviral treatment (ART). However, ART does not cure HIV due to the persistence of virus reservoirs that re-establish infection following treatment interruption. Therapeutic interventions that lower the size of the virus reservoir could delay virus rebound when ART is interrupted. Such reservoir reduction can be achieved by very early ART initiation, but this is not practical for the roughly half of pediatric HIV cases stemming from postnatal infection via breast milk HIV transmission because their diagnosis is delayed. Thus, postnatally infected children would benefit greatly from development of adjunct therapies, including immune-based strategies. Indeed, studies have indicated that antibody passive immunization and therapeutic vaccination can impact virus reservoirs, but their relevance and effect in the maturating infant immune system remains unknown. A first step toward development of immunotherapeutic interventions for postnatally infected infants thus will require identifying the immune mechanisms associated with virus control after breast milk transmission. Thus the objective of this Project is to identify immune correlates of virus rebound in the setting of breast milk transmission. Our central hypothesis is that enhancement of specific antiviral immune responses in ART- treated, simian-human immunodeficiency virus (SHIV)-infected infant rhesus macaques (RMs), either through antibody passive immunization or through vaccination, will reduce the virus reservoir and delay virus rebound after treatment interruption. We propose the following aims: 1) Assess kinetics of virus-specific immune responses in ART treated SHIV-infected infant RMs; 2) Define the impact of adjunct therapy with polyclonal polyfunctional antiviral antibodies on virus rebound in an infant RM model of breast milk transmission and ART; and 3) Evaluate the impact of enhancing T cell responses through vaccination on virus rebound in SHIV- infected ART-treated infant RMs. This Project will interact with the proposed Program's other Project and utilize the services of the Administrative and Statistical Core, the Nonhuman Primate Core, and Virology Core. This Project will identify immune correlates associated with reservoir clearance and/or delay in virus rebound in a highly relevant animal model of postnatal transmission and thereby guide design of pediatric-specific immune- based interventions towards an HIV functional cure."

This TR&D addresses challenges the NMR community faces in making DNP a truly orthogonal, enabling technology for biomolecular ssNMR through three specific aims: 1) develop DNP MAS ssNMR probes with flexible electronic architecture, fast MAS, and extended VT Range; 2) develop a biradical toolbox for targeted DNP enhancement of specific protein classes; and 3) optimize DNP MAS ssNMR approaches for biomolecular structure determination. The goal of these aims is to provide a holistic approach to maximizing the promise of DNP through hardware development, synthesis of needed chemical reagents, optimization of sample preparation strategies, and developing the experimental framework for biomolecular ssNMR in the age of DNP. Advances in all these areas must be pursued to gain the needed sensitivity and resolution for leading edge biomedical research applications and to transition DNP MAS ssNMR to a technique that is more widely accessible to the structural biology community as a whole. Through partnering with six Driving Biomedical Research projects, we will rapidly develop and deploy technology in this TR&D to address biomedical research problems in the areas of membrane protein structure determination, amyloid biogenesis in bacterial biofilms and in neurodenerative diseases, protein assembly in viruses, and enzyme catalysis."

"9374895","Citrullination, a posttranslational modification (PTM), has recently received significant interest in biomedicine, in particular autoimmune diseases. Cintrullination is the modification of peptidyl arginine to peptidyl citrulline catalyzed by peptidylarginine deiminases (PADs). The citrulline modification can dramatically change the structure and functions of proteins. Citrullination has been implicated in several physiological and pathological processes, including rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and Alzheimer?s disease. Thus, a small change in the protein, such as citrullination, can have great consequences for some inflammatory diseases. To date five different human PAD enzymes have been identified, however, cellular distributions and their specific roles are still not clear. At the present there are only a few citrullinated proteins known in mammalian cells. It is currently unknown if citrullination plays any potential role in the assembly or activation of the inflammasome, a multi- protein complex required for active IL-1b release, a powerful proinflammatory cytokine. In preliminary studies we have made a seminal discovery that citrullination plays a critical regulatory role in inflammasome activity and IL-1b release. Based on this knowledge we have now generated compelling preliminary data suggesting a key role of protein citrullination in a Kawasaki Disease (KD) vasculitis mouse model, which we have already established to be an IL-1b-driven cardiovascular disease model. Inhibition of PAD enzymes can block the LCWE-induced KD vasculitis model. This observation is highly novel and potentially of high impact not only for this vasculitis model but also for several other inflammatory diseases where an overactive NLRP3 inflammasome and IL-1b driven pathology is prominent. Based on these preliminary data we propose to investigate the mechanisms of these novel discoveries with the CENTRAL HYPOTHESIS that Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase-mediated citrullination is required for the inflammasome activation and IL-1b secretion, and that pathway is also crucial for LCWE-induced mouse vasculitis, coronary arteritis in this KD mouse model. Peptidyl arginine deiminase 4 is also a key component for neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) in neutrophils, however, the role of PAD in vasculitis was independent of its effect on neutrophils. Based on our preliminary data we hypothesize that PAD and citrullination play a crucial role in inflammasome activation in macrophages, and PAD inhibition thereby may treat the IL-1b driven cardiovascular pathologies that are associated with the KD vasculitis and myocarditis. To investigate these central hypotheses, we propose the following two specific aims: 1) Investigate the role of Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase and Protein Citrullination in inflammasome activation and vasculitis. 2) To determine the role of Peptidyl Arginine Deiminase during LCWE-induced KD vasculitis, coronary arteritis and AAA."
"9306697","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Manipulation of complex objects or tool use is a hallmark of many activities of daily living, but neural control of manual dexterity is still little  understood. Even the seemingly simple task of transporting a cup of coffee without spilling creates complex interaction forces that humans need to predict, preempt, and compensate for. Prediction of such complex nonlinear dynamics based on an internal model appears daunting. Hence, this research tests the hypothesis that humans learn strategies that make the interactions predictable. The task of carrying a cup of coffee is modeled with a cart-and-pendulum system that is rendered in a virtual environment and subjects interact with the virtual cup via a robotic manipulandum. To gain insight into human control strategies, this proposal develops three new analysis avenues based on classical linear analysis, information theory, and nonlinear dynamics that operationalize predictability for quantitative theory-based assessment. Aim 1 applies classical frequency response analysis and tests the hypothesis that humans tune into resonance modes as they not only require lower forces, but also more predictable due to lower signal-dependent noise. Three experiments examine transient and steady-state performance with the linear and nonlinear task model. Aim 2 examines tasks with redundancy that offers a manifold of solutions. Predictability is operationalized by the mutual information between the applied force and object dynamics. Three experiments test whether subjects choose those strategies with the highest mutual information. Aim 3 applies contraction analysis, a theoretical framework that examines convergence, or stability, in the state space of the dynamical system. Two experiments examine whether subjects learn solutions that maximize contraction of their trajectories, especially when confronted with perturbations. As manual dexterity is compromised in many individuals with neurological disorders, the experimental paradigm and its analyses promise to become a useful platform to gain insights into neurological diseases, such as dystonia, multiple sclerosis, including aging."
"9301059","Mutations in the PARK14 gene are strongly associated with a spectrum of neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease (PD) and infantile neuroaxonal dystrophy (INAD) through currently unknown mechanisms. The product of the PARK14 gene is an intracellular calcium-independent phospholipase (PLA2G6 or iPLA2?), which has been implicated in numerous cellular pathways. The protein has a unique multi-domain structure and its activity is regulated at several levels. We propose to solve the crystal structure of the protein in order to advance the mechanistic understanding of iPLA2? function in the brain and other organs. An atomic resolution structure of the enzyme is critical for understanding the mechanism of its activity, its regulation and its function in physiological and pathological states. It will provide the foundation for future development of novel therapeutic approaches to treating neurological and cardiovascular diseases as well as diabetes, cancer and muscular dystrophy.  iPLA2? modulates membrane properties, produces bioactive lipid messengers such as arachidonic acid and lysophospholipids, and regulates store-operated calcium entry in multiple cell types. Calmodulin (CaM) inhibits iPLA2? enzyme activity in the presence of calcium. Several cofactors reverse the inhibition. Numerous additional regulatory mechanisms have been suggested including oligomerization, ATP binding and interaction with other cofactors and proteins. The large number and variety of signaling pathways affected by iPLA2? and the complexity of its macromolecular interactions complicate defining its function in cellular events and the role it plays in neurological disorders. PARK14 mutations are found in all structural domains of the protein. Studies of these mutations provide a unique opportunity to link regulatory elements and the catalytic activity of iPLA2? to specific signaling mechanisms and functions. Structural information about the conformation of surface epitopes, of the active site and membrane and protein recognition interfaces will be indispensible for these studies. The goal of this proposal is to obtain this structural knowledge to significantly advance the understanding of iPLA2? function.  We have crystallized the full-length iPLA2? and now propose to improve the diffraction quality of the crystals and to obtain phasing information to solve the crystal structure of the enzyme. Results from the proposed studies, together with data obtained from biochemical assays, cellular systems and animal models from our group and others will move the entire field forward and will be critical for understanding the functional role of iPLA2? in the brain and other organs including heart and pancreas."

Post-doctoral translational trainees may also be trained in mentors' laboratories to advance their research capacity without earning another degree. Trainees attend required structured seminars, conferences, and have performance reviews twice per year. Guidance is provided by mentoring teams comprised of faculty with expertise and established collaborative research interests across diverse areas of current interest in kidney research. Trainees are immersed in issues regarding the scope and impact of areas of research needed in the field of kidney disease, reviews of the relevant literature, development of research initiatives, data analysis and preparation of abstracts, research presentations, manuscripts and grants. We hope to continue our flourishing training program, with confidence that our trainees will develop into independent research scientists who are prepared to advance research in their area of expertise and to hold leadership positions."
"9292019","Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are two signature disorders of Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OEF/OIF). The two conditions, which often stem from the same event, are frequently comorbid and present with overlapping symptom profiles (e.g. dysphoria, irritability, impaired concentration, sleep disturbance), and result in significant impairment. However, the persistent symptoms of mTBI (such as postconcussive syndrome) and PTSD vary significantly across individuals, even those exposed to similar trauma, suggesting that individual differences play a substantial role in determining long-term outcomes of trauma exposure. Identifying biological factors that underlie these differences would be a critical step towards identifying personalized and targeted rehabilitative interventions.  To date, researchers have identified certain genetic and neural correlates of trauma-related psychopathology, but these findings have limited rehabilitative utility due to 1) the lack of consideration for environmental influences, 2) few genome-wide studies in PTSD and none in TBI, 3) the lack of attention to the polygenic effect of multiple variants, and 4) lack of integration across levels of analysis (i.e. between genetics and neuroimaging). The proposed study will use previously collected data to address these limitations by applying a ?neurogenetic? approach, which models relationships between genes, the environment, and neural sequelae of trauma in OEF/OIF veterans. Specifically, results from an existing PTSD genome-wide association study will be used to generate a polygenic risk score (PGRS), which calculates an individual?s cumulative genetic risk by summing the number of risk alleles across the genome, weighted by each allele?s relative risk.  Aim 1 of the proposed study will conduct a GWAS on the previously collected data in order to calculate a PGRS, which will be used along with combat stress (including physiological and psychological traumatic experiences) to form a polygenic gene by environment (PGxE) interaction. This PGxE interaction will then be used to predict the shared symptoms associated with mTBI and PTSD in three independent samples of OEF/OIF veterans, including one consisting exclusively of veterans with a history of mTBI. This would serve as a cross-validation of PTSD genetic risk into an mTBI sample, thus supporting a shared etiological foundation and laying the groundwork for personalized rehabilitative interventions for those who are most at risk.  Aim 2 of the proposed study will determine if the PGRS score interacts with combat stress to predict biological intermediate phenotypes associated with trauma-related symptomatology. Specifically, anatomical and functional neural connectivity, measured using diffusion tensor imaging and resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging, will be used as dependent variables in PGxE analyses. These neural indices will then be included in a structural equation model (SEM) to identify any possible mediation of the initial PGxE interaction, which would support a plausible mechanistic pathway by which genetic vulnerability increases risk for abnormal neural connectivity, which increases the probability of trauma-related symptomatology.  To our knowledge, the proposed project would be the first to look at genome-wide characterization of TBI patients, to examine polygenic influence on trauma-related symptoms, to model a PGxE interaction, and to apply a neurogenetic approach to identify genetic predictors of neural sequelae to trauma. The results of this project will shed considerable light on the mechanistic pathways that confer risk for trauma-related pathology, allowing for more informed and more personalized applications of rehabilitative strategies."
"9311301","PROJECT SUMMARY ? VDDRC PILOT AND FEASIBILITY PROGRAM The Pilot and Feasibility (P/F) Program is a vital, essential component of the Vanderbilt DDRC (VDDRC). It directly supports the overall goals of the VDDRC, which are to: 1) promote digestive diseases research in an integrative, collaborative, and multidisciplinary manner; 2) attract new investigators to the study of these disorders; 3) enhance the innovative research capabilities of members; and 4) promote the career development of junior investigators. Through the P/F Program, we have a strong track record of recruiting highly talented young investigators and established investigators that are new to digestive disease research, as well as established GI investigators testing exciting new ideas. In the past 10 years, we have supported 58 P/F recipients, with 27 of these in the past 5 years. Our number of grants and the amount of support is greatly enhanced by a commitment of $100,000 per year from VUMC, plus additional funding available from the Vanderbilt Institute for Clinical and Translational Research (VICTR, Vanderbilt CTSA). Over the past two grant award cycles (years 6-15), P/F recipients have garnered $47,707,648 in Direct Cost funding subsequent to their P/F awards, yielding a 30? fold return on investment of the NIH funds used for P/F awards. We have demonstrated major benefits to the career development of PIs that were supported as Type N (New Investigators) in the P/F program, including development of faculty as transformers of their research fields and growth into academic leadership positions. The P/F Program has been directed since 2010 by Keith T. Wilson, M.D., Thomas F. Frist Sr. Professor of Medicine, Cancer Biology, and Pathology, Microbiology and Immunology, and Associate Director of the VDDRC. The VDDRC provides an applicant-friendly environment in which annual P/F grant opportunities are widely circulated via the VDDRC website and email announcements, and potential candidates interact directly with the P/F Director to ensure that their projects meet the goals of the VDDRC, optimize use of VDDRC Cores, and meet NIH guidelines for rigor and reproducibility. Our Specific Aims are: 1) To recruit talented New Investigators (Type N) without current or past independent NIH support to digestive disease research, in order to provide a foundation for career development and future independent funding; all successful Type N recipients benefit from enrollment in the VDDRC Academy of Investigators. 2) To recruit established investigators new to digestive disease research (Type EN), by supporting their studies of a digestive disease- related problem, with the goal of fostering collaborations and new directions that may lead to subsequent related publications, projects, and research grants in the field. 3) To support established investigators (Type E) in the digestive disease field in the pursuit of highly innovative, exciting new ideas, which is a significant departure from their previous work, and is likely to result in an important and fruitful new line of investigation. The overall goal is enhanced digestive disease-related research with exciting and transformative new ideas that can be catalyzed by P/F support and extensive interaction with Center members and activities."
"9280965","Project A - Structural Studies of Type III CRISPR-Cas Surveillance Complexes  Jennifer Doudna  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   CRISPR-Cas systems provide bacteria and archaea with adaptive immunity to viruses and plasmids using  RNA-guided degradation of target sequences. Among the three CRISPR-Cas systems that have been  identified, the Type III systems may be uniquely capable of both RNA and DNA target binding and cleavage.  We aim to determine the molecular mechanisms by which Type III CRISPR-Cas systems recognize nucleic  acids and trigger site-specific cleavage. The results of this project will both provide fundamental insights into  CRISPR-Cas biology and enable application of these systems for programmable target modification or  elimination. The Type III CRISPR-Cas surveillance complexes are stable and structurally homogeneous,  making them particularly well-suited to study by electron microscopy. At the same time, these complexes are  relatively small (~350?400 kDa) and can bind to different kinds of substrate sequences, necessitating use of  state-of-the-art EM methods and development of new strategies for imaging and analyzing single particles.  Thus, this project will benefit enormously from the overall Program and the insights to come from the Core and  associated Projects. The project will focus on two types of RNA-protein complexes that constitute the nucleic  acid targeting machinery of the Type III CRISPR systems. In Type III-A CRISPR-Cas systems, the Csm  complex comprising five protein subunits and a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) finds and degrades target nucleic acids.  To determine how RNA versus DNA substrates are identified and degraded, we will extend preliminary studies  using electron microscopy to solve Csm complex structures and to define how target sequences are cleaved in  a site-specific manner. In Type III-B CRISPR-Cas systems, the Cmr complex containing six distinct subunit  proteins and a crRNA locates and cleaves target sequences that can base pair with the crRNA. Although  functionally analogous to RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) that operate during RNA interference in  eukaryotic cells, the Cmr complex comprises entirely distinct components and operates by an unknown  mechanism. We will continue ongoing studies to determine the molecular structure of the Cmr complex and to  understand how it cleaves target sequences in a site-specific manner."
"9484831","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Interferon gamma produced by CD4+ T cells during malaria infection is known to be important for elimination of parasites from the host (also known as restriction). In preliminary studies, we have found that CD4+ T cells possess interferon-independent mechanisms of malaria parasite restriction, but the specific molecules involved remain unknown. We also find that phagocytes are critically important for control of acute infection, suggesting that CD4+ T cells may target myeloid cells such as macrophages through interferon-independent mechanisms. We have identified a candidate factor - macrophage colony stimulating factor - that is expressed by CD4+ T cells responding to malaria infection, and is consistent with the increase in macrophage numbers that occurs during malaria infection and their essentiality for anti-parasite activity. The proposed work will determine the role of macrophage colony stimulating factor in restriction of malaria parasites, and determine whether the fraction of this cytokine originating from CD4+ T cells plays a physiologically significant rol in this process. The studies have the potential to identify a significant new mechanism of host protection and a new role for helper T cells in contributing to the immunological control of malaria infection."
"9331824","Transendothelial migration (TEM) is a critical step in the inflammatory response in which leukocytes leave the blood vessel to enter the inflamed tissues. Most pathology, including ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, is due to dysfunctional inflammation. I/R injury occurs when tissues deprived of oxygen are reoxygenated, producing reactive oxygen species that damage cells and incite local inflammation. I/R injury is a major source of morbidity and mortality in myocardial infarction (MI; heart attack), making ischemic injury to the heart muscle even worse. Limiting I/R injury is major goal in treatment of MI and other vascular disorders.  TEM is initiated by interactions between platelet/endothelial cell adhesion molecule 1 (PECAM) on the surface of leukocytes and PECAM concentrated at the endothelial cell (EC) borders. Efficient TEM requires a transient increase in cytosolic free calcium ion concentration (?[Ca2+]i). TRPC6 was found to be the calcium channel responsible for (?[Ca2+]i) and functions downstream of PECAM-PECAM interactions to promote TEM. However, the mechanism by which PECAM signals to TRPC6 is unknown. I will determine how PECAM signals to TRPC6, how TRPC6 regulates ?[Ca2+]i in vivo, and the relevance of TRPC6 to I/R injury in MI.  Endothelial cells have a junctional mechanosensory complex consisting of PECAM, vascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin, and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2). This signaling complex responds to fluid shear. Preliminary data suggest that this same complex may also function to transmit signals from PECAM to TRPC6 during TEM.  Aim I will determine how PECAM signals to activate TRPC6. We will use specific pharmacologic inhibitors as well as knockdown and re-expression strategies for each component of the system. PECAM FRET tension sensors and VE-cadherin mutants will be used to test the hypothesis that EC PECAM uses the same mechanosensory signaling complex to transmit stress from engagement of PECAM on the leukocyte pseudopod as it does to transmit stress from fluid sheer. In Aim II, intravital microscopy will be used to quantify the timing and intensity of ?[Ca2+]i in mice with the genetically encoded calcium sensor GCaMP3 expressed in EC. We will breed TRPC6-deficient and sufficient mice with GCaMP3 restricted to EC. These mice will be irradiated and reconstituted with bone marrow from TRPC6 WT mice to compare TEM and ?[Ca2+]i in mice with and without TRPC6. Aim III will determine the role of TRPC6 in the clinically relevant inflammatory setting of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury. We will study I/R at the cellular level by intravital microscopy and at the organ level in an acute myocardial infarction model. As TRPC6 knockout significantly decreases TEM in models of inflammation, we hypothesize that TRPC6 inhibition will offer protection from I/R injury. These studies will provide insights into the mechanisms of TEM and may identify TRPC6 as a novel therapeutic target for a multitude of diseases caused by pathologic inflammation, including I/R injury in myocardial infarction."
"9392295","Abstract BRCA1/2 mutation carriers are at higher risk of developing breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Breast cancer survivors with a BRCA1/2 mutation are at higher risk of developing contralateral breast cancer. Genetic cancer risk assessments (GCRA) for HBOC can inform prevention and treatment decisions. Despite guidelines to refer women at risk of carrying a mutation to GCRA, Latina and Black women underuse these services. Reasons for low GCRA use include access and psychosocial factors (e.g. low knowledge). Our preliminary data with at-risk Black and Latina women suggests that improving access does not necessarily translate into higher GCRA uptake. Theoretically guided interventions that support GCRA uptake in underserved populations are needed. Fuzzy Trace Theory posits that people tend to construct gist representations that capture the essential bottom-line meaning of the risk information, including the emotional experience. However, most interventions tend to prioritize quantitative risk communication and do not often consider emotional aspects, despite evidence that emotions influence risk perceptions. BRCA-gist is an Intelligent Tutoring System intervention informed by Fuzzy Trace Theory that uses avatars to emulate tailored one-to-one human tutoring and includes the HBOC risk messages? bottom-line meaning. The preliminary efficacy of BRCA-gist has been established in a non-clinical sample of mostly White college students but has not been tested in at-risk women. This study aims to adapt BRCA-gist and test its feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy in a sample of at-risk Black and Latina women. In Aim 1 we will gather input from providers (n=10) about adaptations for implementation in clinical settings and from at-risk Latina and Black women (n=20) about cultural adaptations. In Aim 2 we will randomize at-risk Black and Latina women to BRCA-gist (n=50) or NCI Web arms (n=50). Participants will complete a baseline and a post- intervention assessment. A research assistant will refer them to local free genetic counseling services. Our primary outcome is GCRA uptake at 3 months. Aim 1: Adapt BRCA-gist. Providers and at-risk Black and Latina women will do the BRCA-gist intervention and provide suggestions to make cultural adaptations to implement BRCA-gist in community/clinic settings. Aim 2: Test the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of BRCA-gist intervention in a two-arm RCT. We expect high overall retention (?75%) and high satisfaction among women in the BRCA-gist arm (?75%) (H.2.1., H.2.2). H.2.3. Participants in the BRCA-gist arm (vs. NCI Web) will have a higher uptake of GCRA services 3 months post intervention. H.2.4. Participants in the BRCA-gist arm (vs. NCI Web) will have a greater increase in knowledge, gist comprehension, and GCRA intentions. We will explore differences by ethnicity and health literacy and assess emotional reactions to risk information to inform future affective-tailored interventions. If successful, BRCA-gist can be tested in larger samples and could constitute a scalable inexpensive intervention with promising translational applications and potential to reduce disparities."
"9459712","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): T cell histone GlcNAcylation participates in the epigenetics of lupus ABSTRACT Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects women ten times more often than men. Altered T cell signaling links genetic and environmental factors and contributes to disease etiopathogenesis. DNA methylation, histone modification, and miRNA regulate gene expression and chromatin structure by modifying the epigenome. DNA methylation suppresses gene transcription and in SLE, the female inactive X-chromosome is hypomethylated, which causes overexpression of genes that predispose females to lupus. SLE is also characterized by global T cell DNA hypomethylation that causes overexpression of immune- related genes and subsequent autoimmunity. We recently found that OGT (O-linked N-acetylglucosamine transferase), an X-linked gene, is overexpressed in female lupus T cells. OGT reversibly adds ß-N-acetyl-glucosamine (O-GlcNAc) to serine and threonine residues of proteins competing with phosphorylation. This makes OGT a regulator of cell signaling and transcription. Interestingly, GlcNAcylated protein levels are increased in female, but not male, T cell lupus patients, which correlate with OGT overexpression. Furthermore, O-GlcNAc is considered part of the histone code, and OGT regulates O-GlcNAcylation of histones. Histone 2B (H2B) is GlcNAc at Ser 112, a modification that facilitates H2BK120 ubiquitination required for transcriptional activation. Additionally, Ten Eleven Translocation enzymes TET2 and TET3 interact directly with OGT and co-localize on chromatin at active promoters. The effects of OGT in signaling pathways and on chromatin structure of T cells are unknown but may play an important role in T cell dysfunction in lupus as well as autoimmunity in general. We hypothesize that OGT overexpression in female lupus T cells modifies signaling pathways and DNA- histone binding profiles by O-GlcNAc of protein targets and chromatin remodelers. Hence, OGT may ultimately be an epigenetic modulator in lupus. To test this hypothesis, we propose to use proteomic and genetic approaches to: 1) Identify molecular targets of OGT, which are key proteins in T cell signaling that may contribute to the pathogenesis of lupus; 2) Determine whether overexpression of OGT in CD4 T cells results in altered glycosylation of histone proteins; and 3) Examine the effects of H2B modifications on gene regulation in cells that overexpress OGT This study will uncover abnormalities in T cell pathways and changes in gene regulation in SLE caused by OGT, a gene aberrantly expressed in female lupus T cells that may predispose females to the disease. By identifying new biomarkers and targets this project will serve as the foundation for future studies aimed at improving therapies for patients suffering from SLE and potentially other autoimmune diseases."

"9513103","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Alcohol abuse is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. In the US, 18 million Americans abuse alcohol, with alcoholic liver disease affecting over 10 million people. Alcohol abuse's deleterious effects on the liver leads to pathologically distinct entities. Chronic conditions include steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis ad cirrhosis; patients can develop acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH) at any time in the progression of disease. Disease progression only occurs in a sub-set of heavy drinkers, suggesting a role for genetic and environmental risk factors. There is a pressing clinical need to develop improved therapies for patients with AH, as the current strategy of glucocorticoid (GC) treatment is only effective in a sub-set of patients. Development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AH requires 1) identification and validation of new drug targets and therapeutic strategies, 2) development of rationally designed and innovative biomarkers that will improve our ability to diagnose AH and rapidly determine the efficacy of treatment strategies and 3) understanding the genetic contributions to both the severity of ASH and sensitivity to therapeutic intervention. In the Cleveland Clinic Translational Component of our U01 application for Novel therapies for alcoholic hepatitis, we will leverage the considerable expertise of basic and clinical investigators to take a three-armed approach to developing improved therapeutic strategies for the treatment of AH. First, we propose translational studies to develop innovative non-invasive biomarkers based on a) breath gas analysis for exhaled volatile organic compounds that are reflective of both intestinal health and liver function and b) urinary analysis of sensitive biomarkers of kidney function which would allow for early diagnosis and treatment of kidney failure in patients with AH. Second, we will carry out pharmacogenomic analyses and bioinformatics to develop genetic signatures that predict sensitivity of patients to individual and/or combined therapies investigated in the Clinical Component of this U01 application. These data will help clinicians to optimize and individualize treatment protocols, as well as identify new therapeutic targets. Lastly, we will develop two lead therapeutics for treating patients with AH in a pre-clinical mouse model: a) regulation of complement activation to decrease inflammation and protect hepatocytes from cell death and b) treatment with tri-butyrate as a colonic fuel source to improve gut integrity. Advances in each of these aims will be accelerated via interactions with the other Translational and Clinical U01 proposals, leading to the development of novel therapeutics for the treatment of patients with both moderate and severe AH."
"9359531","Summary The project's broad objective is an understanding of the impact of two common treatments for stone disease on renal calcium (Ca) handling, and the links between renal physiology and tissue calcifications in stone formers (SF). Stone formation requires urine supersaturation (SS) with calcium oxalate (CaOx) and calcium phosphate (CaP); idiopathic hypercalciuria (IH) is a common cause of increased SS. Prevention of stone recurrence relies on decreasing SS, but the optimal means of doing this in a given patient is not clear. Decreased tubular Ca reabsorption (rCa), in both proximal and distal nephron, is characteristic of IH. We hypothesize that renal tubule transport alterations are linked to pathogenesis of the tissue calcifications found in SF, as well as to their stones, and propose to study Ca SF with IH (IHSF) who have undergone papillary mapping during endoscopy who will be selected for one of two papillary appearances: 1) papillae with abundant plaque but no plugging (typical of many CaOx SF) or 2) plugs with modest plaque (typical of apatite SF). We will test the hypothesis that plaque surface area correlates with decreased proximal tubule rCa, and plug area correlates with increased CaP SS (Aim 1.1a,b). Having demonstrated differences between IHSF and normals (N) in rCa on a stable diet, both fasting and fed, we propose to explore these findings using high and low Na intake, with or without Kcitrate. We will study the effects on rCa, fasting, fed and overnight (a high risk period for stone formation), using lithium clearance and urine stone risk factors (Aims 1.2a, 1.4a, 1.5). To understand the mechanisms of the changes in rCa that we expect with low Na diet and K citrate, we will measure urine exosomes for both proximal and distal nephron transporters (Aims 1.2b, 1.4, and 1.5). SS and upper limit of metastability will be measured to gain a better understanding of how K citrate and low Na diet affects these important treatment parameters (Aim 1.5, 1.6). To gain further insight into plaque and plug formation the role of inflammation (Aim 1.3)."

"9359390","Project Summary  The Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) has a long and successful track record of conducting innovative pilot and  Phase I clinical trials, including studies targeting specific molecular pathways relevant to cancer, angiogenesis  inhibition, cell-based therapy, and stem cell transplantation. Early Phase Clinical Research Support (EPCRS)  has been particularly helpful in supporting the conduct of high priority, innovative, pilot and/or Phase I clinical  trials. The pilot and Phase I trials that receive funding via this mechanism are of the highest priority for the ACC  as they often lay the groundwork for future efficacy studies. Trials supported by EPCRS include both traditional  ?investigator-initiated? studies of short duration (e.g., 1-2 years) and studies that result from collaborations with  industry in which the ACC investigator is the primary contributor to the design and conduct of the trial and often  has conducted the preclinical research that provided the rationale for the study.  The primary focus of EPCRS during the project period has been to enable the conduct of innovative early  phase trials. Funds have been used to support oncology research nurses and data managers for qualified,  carefully selected trials. Studies supported by EPCRS, while highly meritorious, are often unfunded or under-  funded, and thus unable to cover research nursing and/or data management costs adequately without such  support. In addition, EPCRS funded studies are generally complex, and usually include novel biological  correlative studies requiring expert study coordination. Consistent with this complexity, the EPCRS-supported  research nurses and data managers are among our most highly trained staff. EPCRS enables this core group  of experienced professionals to support ACC investigators in conducting ground-breaking translational  research studies in a manner that responds to the needs of the investigators and matches the technical  demands of the individual studies."

"9359386","Project Summary  The Abramson Cancer Center (ACC) has a well-established internal, Institutional, and external Planning and  Evaluation (P&E) process that engages leaders, members, and advisors from multiple disciplines, perspectives  and levels. The goal of this process is to guide future directions, set priorities and prioritize investments of the  Center while, at the same time, providing ongoing mechanisms to monitor, assess and adjust research  progress, Programs, Shared Resources, allocations, and strategies. This cohesive process is supported by  highly integrated and effective bodies, such as the Senior Leaders, Executive Committee, Program Leaders,  Shared Resource Advisory Committees, and the External Scientific Advisory Board (ESAB), which provides  critical advice and feedback from experts. The Planning and Evaluation process has resulted in changes in  Program focus, development of new Cores, changes in clinical research operations, and prioritization of  Developmental Funds. Complementing these efforts are Programmatic, Divisional and Center-wide research  seminars, meetings and retreats that foster new interactions and collaborations with Penn colleagues and  external experts. Strategic planning is embedded in the ACC and Penn culture. The ACC plan of 2008-2013  set forth the goals for this period, including accelerating the translation of basic science discoveries into  investigator-initiated clinical trials, establishing a comprehensive molecular profiling and personalized medicine  initiative, enhancing behavioral interventions to reduce cancer risk, and promoting translation of ACC research.  Soon after his appointment, the Center Director, Dr. Dang, defined his vision through 2020, and charged a  group to recommend strategies to realize the Center's goals in translational research and precision medicine.  A defining accomplishment has been $20M from the Institution to establish innovative transdisciplinary  programmatic efforts in translational cancer research, which are fueled by multi-year Institutional grants and  resources in high priority areas. Rigorous internal review of Programs, Shared Resources, Developmental  Funds, and strategic plan reviews by the ESAB ensure that the ACC continues to strive for excellence and  adheres to NCI guidelines.

"9344707","PROJECT SUMMARY The goal of the proposed research in this application is to characterize alterations in cortico-basal ganglia connectivity in a novel non-human primate model of Huntington's disease (HD) recently developed in my laboratory. Previous K99/R00 funding (2010-2015) from the NINDS supported the development of this new model, wherein we found that AAV-mediated expression of mutant HTT in the caudate and putamen of rhesus macaques lead to a wide array of behavioral manifestations of disease including the progressive development of both motor and cognitive phenotypes also seen in human HD patients. Brains from HD NHPs showed DARPP-32 loss, inclusion formation and gliosis, along with reduced levels of key striatal transcripts, including reduced glutamate and dopamine receptor levels (manuscript in preparation). In addition to striatal pathology, we found mHTT expression, inclusion bodies and gliosis in numerous cortical areas (frontal and motor) and regions throughout the basal ganglia (globus pallidus, substantia nigra), likely owing to transport of the AAV vector. These findings strongly suggest that basal ganglia connectivity may be disrupted in our NHP HD model. The objective of this current proposal is to characterize cortico-basal ganglia connectivity in the brains of our HD NHPs using resting state fMRI and diffusion tensor imaging to assess functional connectivity and white matter integrity, respectively (Aim 1). Additionally, we will evaluate glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission in the caudate and putamen using electrophysiological analyses (Aim 2). We will test our central hypothesis that there is a progressive decline in basal ganglia connectivity in our HD NHP brains that correlates with 1) the longitudinal development of cognitive and motor phenotypes, 2) reduced glutamate and dopamine transmission in cortico-striatal and nigro-striatal connections with medium spiny neurons in the caudate and putamen and 3) neuropathology including inclusion formation, gliosis and neuronal dysfunction. I have assembled an excellent team of scientists to accomplish these goals with cumulative expertise in resting state fMRI analysis of cortico-striatal functional connectivity (Dr. Christopher Kroenke), electrophysiological recordings of medium spiny neurons in the rhesus macaque striatum (Dr. Verginia Cuzon Carlson), statistical analysis of complex datasets (Dr. Byung Park), as well as my background and expertise in HD neurobiology, AAV-mediated gene transfer, NHP MRI-guided neurosurgery, complex NHP motor and cognitive behavioral assessment and the use of molecular and histological techniques to assess HD neuropathology. By the end of the studies proposed here, we will have characterized alterations in basal ganglia connectivity in a novel AAV- mHTT mediated monkey model of HD, elucidating potential pathophysiological mechanisms that underlie motor and cognitive decline. Additionally, the data obtained from these studies will provide the unique opportunity to identify imaging, behavioral, electrophysiological and neuropathological endpoints that will be used for future therapeutic studies using this model."
"9316821","Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules bind to peptide antigens and present these antigens to CD8 T cells. Human MHC class I variants are encoded by the HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-C genes. These genes are highly polymorphic. The polymorphisms influence outcomes in a number of infectious diseases, cancers and inflammatory diseases. Among the three HLA class I loci, HLA-B molecules are shown have dominant influences upon outcomes in multiple diseases. A given HLA class I allotype can bind to a large number of cellular and pathogen-derived peptides, collectively called the peptidome. The diversity of HLA-B peptidomes could be one factor underlying their different effects upon disease outcomes. A number of factors are predicted to influence peptidome diversity among HLA class I allotypes, including the structure of the peptide-binding site, the intracellular assembly mechanism and the intrinsic stability of the peptide-deficient form. Several HLA-B molecules are assembled via unconventional intracellular pathways that are suggestive of the presence of novel unconventional epitopes within their peptidomes. We propose to use liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods to quantify, characterize and understand the full breadth of the peptidomes of selected HLA-B variants. Based on existing MS datasets, we will also develop globally normalized methods to quantify and compare peptidome diversities of different HLA-B variants. The findings of this study will be significant towards epitope and HLA selection during vaccine design against cancers and infectious diseases. The studies will also establish methods to identify novel disease-relevant epitopes, and allow a better understanding of the relationships between HLA class I genotypes and disease outcomes."
"9382680","Self-regulation and the transition to middle school  The transition from elementary to middle school often precipitates a downward spiral in academic performance characterized by declining grades, academic disengagement, and eventual high school drop-out. During this same period, risky behaviors such as substance abuse and sexual risk-taking increase. Low-income African American and Latino children are particularly vulnerable to the negative effects of this transition. Disentangling the factors contributing to the academic success/failure of low-income African American and Latino youth requires viewing development as a complex developmental process with ?intertwined developmental trajectories, social pathways, and social convoys? (Benner, 2011). For low-income African American and Latino youth in particular, it is important to consider the intersection of social class, culture, and ethnicity for children of color transitioning to middle school. Life course theory suggests that early life stress can have a cumulative effect on development. Accordingly, individual level vulnerabilities at multiple levels of the youth ecology (individual, family, school, and neighborhood) can be potentiated during times of exposure to additional normative stressors, such as developmental transition points. Minority youth from low-SES families not only experience difficulties associated with poverty but also cultural stress (e.g., assimilation, discrimination) which undermine their ability to face normative stressors such as transitioning into middle school.  We propose to follow a large cohort of low-income African American and Latino children first enrolled at age 2½ as part of the Dallas Preschool Readiness Project (DPReP) as they transition into middle school. DPReP participants have completed four waves of data collection that have included measures of emerging self- regulation skills, academic achievement, and behavior problems. By following this sample into middle school, we will characterize trajectories of self-regulation development to address the following primary aims: Aim 1. Examine how individual differences in trajectories of self-regulation development from 2½ years into  middle school are related to differences in academic and behavioral adjustment in middle school for  low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 2. Examine how the interrelated contexts of family, school and neighborhood contribute to the middle  school academic and behavioral adjustment of low-income African Americans and Latinos. Aim 3. Examine how the relation of family, school, and neighborhood contexts to academic and behavioral  adjustment in middle school is both mediated and moderated by self-regulation skills among low-  income African Americans and Latinos. Data collection methods will include home visits, phone interviews, teacher surveys, and classroom and neighborhood observations. Measures include child self-regulation, assessments of academic performance and social competence, family environment, classroom environment, teacher-child relationship, and neighborhood conditions. Analytic methods will include structural equations modeling, and latent differences models."
"9352353","Summary The hydrocarbon core of a bilayer is normally a strict barrier to the passage of polar or charged solutes. We have discovered a novel class of cationic peptides that efficiently cross this barrier without causing bilayer permeabilization. These peptides are fundamentally different from other classes of membrane active peptides, and may hold the key to understanding how to bypass the barrier of the hydrocarbon core on demand. Yet, the determinants of this behavior are currently unknown. Here we will explore the physical chemical basis of peptide translocation by comprehensively examining rationally designed sequence variants of a known translocating peptide. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that translocation occurs only if the peptides have a specific translocation-enabling sequence motif and optimal hydrophobicity. Here we will test the hypothesis that translocation of peptides across bilayers requires optimal hydrophobicity that ensures a low steady state population in a membrane, and a specific sequence motif consisting of two arginines spaced by two hydrophobic residues, embedded in a hydrophobic sequence. We will determine the importance of these translocation-permissive properties by varying them independently by rational sequence modification and assessing the effect on (1) translocation across bilayers, (2) binding to bilayers, and (3) the structural response of the bilayer to the peptides."
"9318573","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Persuading households to adopt safe, effective, and low-cost interventions to improve health is challenging. Door-to-door health campaigns, once a staple of public health practice in the US, are now rarely used. In developing country settings, door-to-door campaigns remain vital for disease prevention and dissemination of health-related products and services. Unfortunately, participation rates in such campaigns are often low, diminishing the effectiveness of low-cost, proven interventions. For example, current low household participation rates in the Chagas disease vector control program in Arequipa, Peru threaten Chagas control efforts in the region. Chagas, a devastating insect-borne disease affecting than 8 million people, is one of the principal infectious causes of morbidity and mortality in the Americas. Previous work has shown a quiet epidemic of Chagas in poorer communities in Arequipa, where more than 5% of children are infected. The overarching goal of this study is to develop and evaluate new interventions to increase participation in large-scale public health campaigns, such as vector control campaigns, where high rates of participation are required to achieve health gains. The interventions are based on recent discoveries from behavioral economics about the common cognitive biases and mental shortcuts that contribute to low uptake of life-saving measures. The interventions include responsive scheduling with advance commitment; neighbor recruitment; and contingent group lotteries. Advance commitments and lotteries both counter present bias-the common tendency to heavily weight immediate costs and benefits relative to future ones when making decisions. Neighbor recruitment leverages the power of social norms to change behavior. The aims of the study are to: (1) Determine the rate of participation under these three behavioral economic interventions in a vector control campaign; (2) Measure the comparative cost- effectiveness of the behavioral economic interventions; and (3) Assess the impact of each behavioral economic intervention on participation in subsequent public health campaigns. The study is uniquely positioned to both strengthen Chagas disease control efforts in the Americas, and to contribute to a general understanding of behavioral economics interventions across a wide range of health topics where uptake at the household level is critical, including bed bug control, fire safety and poisoning prevention."
"9316599","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Many women suffer from life altering lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). However, prevention of LUTS is hampered by lack of understanding and definition of true bladder health. The existing paradigm of healthy bladder is too narrowly defined as absence of LUTS, ignoring the World Health admonition that health is NOT JUST absence of disease. To become a nation of women with healthy bladders and reduce high public and private medical care costs, a seismic shift is necessary in how we approach knowledge development about bladder health and subsequently LUTS prevention. We know what LUTS look like (incontinence, urinary tract infection, etc.) but scant literature is availableto guide characterization of the healthy bladder. In this proposal, a broadly interdisciplinary research team with backgrounds in nursing, epidemiology, prevention science, behavioral science, and primary care medicine at the University of Michigan will use our expertise in health promotion and risk reduction to address this knowledge gap. We will characterize bladder health across the lifespan using a process of understanding key intersections of biological and physiological life stages (adolescence, adulthood, childbearing, peri-menopause/menopause, elderly) with psychosocial and behavioral responses to societal messaging about bladder health as experienced by female adolescents, women, parents and primary health care clinicians. The goal is to develop an evidence base about healthy female adolescent's and women's experience of bladder health using novel mixed methods approaches to inform prevention strategies for LUTS. Study aims are:  1. Construct an operational definition of the healthy bladder drawing from expert opinion and concept analysis methods, 2. Further develop/refine/pilot a simple but conceptually novel survey instrument capable of capturing variance within the healthy bladder state.  3. Pilot low-cost developmental projects that will enrich productivity and interdisciplinary collaborations of the Preventing LUTS consortium, including developing fundamental knowledge required for securing funding on investigation of LUTS prevention. More than 1 in 3 US women suffer from the distressing, embarrassing, and often unreported problems of LUTS. This work significantly addresses these challenges by establishing an evidence base of normal ranges and associated covariates for women with healthy bladders across each life stage to lay the foundation for developing rational, effective prevention strategies to reduce the heavy disease burden of LUTS faced by women and society."
"9335753","Adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) affects ~3% of the population worldwide and is estimated to cost several billion dollars annually in surgeries alone in the US. The causes of AIS remain largely unknown. While mutations in genes leading to syndromic scoliosis (associated with other symptoms) have been discovered, the identification of mutations causing non-syndromic/isolated AIS (only AIS without any other symptoms), have been less successful. Several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified AIS-associated single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in noncoding regions adjacent to promising candidate genes, suggesting a role for gene regulatory sequences, such as enhancers, in AIS. In our preliminary results for example, we show that the activity of a somitic muscle and spinal cord enhancer near PAX1, a gene known to be involved in spinal development, is abolished by AIS-associated SNPs identified by GWAS. Here, we plan to take advantage of functional enhancer assays in zebrafish and mice combined with mouse CRISPR/Cas9 knockouts to characterize gene regulatory sequences that are associated with AIS. These sequences will be selected from GWAS studies, both from the literature and Project 1 (Human) and near genes shown to cause AIS in zebrafish from our Project 2 (Zebrafish). In addition, using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq for a repressive mark (H3K27me3), active marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, RNAPII) and candidate transcription factors on AIS- associated tissues, we will identify gene regulatory elements that could be associated with AIS, thus revealing additional sequence candidates whose alteration could lead to AIS. While there is no specific tissue whose aberration is widely known to cause AIS, there is now ample evidence linking chondrocytes to AIS. Our collaborators in Project 2 have shown that chondrocyte-specific deletion of the Gpr126 gene (a AIS GWAS gene) in mice, leads to scoliosis beginning at 20 days of age. We thus plan to initially carry out RNA-seq and ChIP-seq on mouse chondrocytes at early time points. Later on in the project we plan to use RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to characterize additional cell types/tissues where AIS candidate genes identified in Project 1 (Human) and Project 2 (Zebrafish) are expressed. Combined, our work will allow for the functional characterization of regulatory regions that are important in AIS pathogenesis, and begin to provide a genomic encyclopedia of regulatory elements that could be associated with this disease, thus providing additional candidate regions for mutation screening in individuals with AIS. In addition, our work will serve as a model for the functional characterization of gene regulatory elements involved in additional subtypes of scoliosis, musculoskeletal and other human disease."
"9312949","PROJECT SUMMARY The overall goal of the Integrative Morphology Core of the Digestive Health Center (DHC) is to provide DHC investigators with state-of-the-art, high quality, efficient and reliable technology support for morphologic studies of digestive diseases. The Core pursues this goal with three complementary aims. In the first aim ?to develop an effective service infrastructure to support morphologic studies,? the Core developed and implemented an organizational infrastructure and personnel to greatly facilitate the request and execution of services in a cost-efficient basis, while enhancing interactions between the investigative groups. The Core is directed by an experienced pathologist with expertise on molecular biology and advanced instrumentation for high-definition analysis of fixed and living cells and tissues. In the second aim ?to augment microscopic analyses of tissue and cellular structure and function,? the Core staffs three laboratories with highly qualified technicians or directors in three complementary laboratories: 1) Research Pathology Laboratory, focusing on histochemical, immunostaining, and electron microscopy analysis of cells and tissues; 2) Liver Microscopy Laboratory that specializes in 2-photon-based confocal microscopy of live cells and tissues; and 3) Confocal Imaging Laboratory, with a superb infrastructure for high-end confocal microscopy. In the third aim ?to ensure quality control, cost efficiency, and technology transfer,? the Core implements a quality assurance program related to reliability of reagents, well-functioning instruments, user safety, proper hands-on-training, and streamlined process for service requests. The Core also holds seminars and workshops as part of the Center enrichment series with the goal to provide DHC investigators with practical reviews and analysis of the latest technologies and assays, and to empower investigators to take advantage of the resources based on their scientific needs. This management strategy and commitment to research excellence have resulted in large utilization of services and have been linked to a high scientific output in peer-reviewed original publications that are relevant to digestive disease."
"9517609","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In response to the RFA-AA-12-007, Indiana University (IU), Mayo Clinic (Mayo), and Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) have formed a consortium Translational Research and Evolving Alcoholic Hepatitis Treatments(TREAT). Central hypotheses of this application are: (a) a large cohort of patients with well-characterized acute alcoholic hepatitis (AH) and matched controls greatly enhances our ability to conduct translational studies in humans to better understand its pathogenesis and to develop novel treatments, and (b) alcohol-induced impairment of signaling via bile salt receptors impairs gut integrity, permits activation of Kupffer cells, enhances oxidative stress in the liver, stimulates fatty liver, and sensitizes hepatocytes to cytokine-induced necroapoptosis, and that these abnormalities can be reversed with the FXR agonist, obeticholic acid (OCA). We will address these hypotheses by conducting the following patient- oriented studies. Specific Aim 1: To conduct a prospective multicenter observational study of patients with well-characterized AH and suitable controls that serves as the foundation for conducting novel mechanistic and therapeutic studies. A robust central bio-repository of serum/plasma, peripheral mononuclear cells, genomic DNA, urine, stool samples, and liver tissue (where available) will be developed from both cases and controls. Specific Aim 2: To test the hypothesis that alcohol-induced impairment of signaling via farnesoid X receptor (FXR, the bile salt nuclear receptor) interrupts normal bile salt homeostasis, and that this will be reversed with an FXR agonist, obeticholic acids (OCA). A secondary hypothesis is that altered FXR signaling impairs gut integrity, promotes activation of the innate immune response, enhances hepatic oxidative stress, and sensitizes hepatocytes to cytokine-induced necroapoptosis. . To address these hypotheses, we will conduct a study of bile salt metabolism and effects of OCA in heavy drinkers without liver disease (n=15), moderate drinkers (n=15), and non-drinkers (n=15). Specific Aim 3: To test the hypothesis that FXR agonists are effective in treating AH by correcting multiple abnormalities implicated in its pathogenesis. We will test this hypothesis by conducting a proof-of-concept multicenter, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of OCA in patients with moderately severe AH. Sixty adults with AH of moderate severity will be randomized to receive either obeticholic acid (10 mg once daily by mouth) or placebo for 4 weeks. Primary efficacy end point is change in MELD score at 4 weeks [5] and the primary safety end point is the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE) at 4 weeks. Specific aim 4: To participate in the two other proof-of-concept studies proposed by the other two members of the TREAT consortium."
"9272926","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This proposal from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) responds to RFA HL-14-014 for Clinical Centers for the Prevention and Early Treatment of Acute Lung Injury (PETAL) Network, with a commitment to enroll 40 patients annually in clinical trials based in the Emergency Departments and the Intensive Care Units. The Principal Investigator will be Michael A. Matthay, MD, Professor of Medicine & Anesthesia at UCSF and the Co-Investigator will be Greg Hendey, MD, Professor and Chair, Emergency Medicine, UCSF-Fresno. There will be four participating hospitals that have an established track record of effective communication, collaboration and patient recruitment as part of the Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) Network 2: (1) UCSF Moffitt-Long Hospital, the major teaching hospital at UCSF; (2) UCSF Fresno/Community Regional Medical Center, a major medical center caring for patients in the Central Valley of California located in Fresno, CA; (3) University of California, Davis Medical Center; and (4) Stanford University Medical Center. Thus, the California Network will be comprised of four major medical centers in Northern California that draw from a total population of approximately 12 million people. Each site has an established and highly motivated research coordinator and critical care investigator with experience in ARDS Network 2. To be responsive to this RFA, each site has added an Emergency Department investigator with significant prior experience in clinical trials. In addition to our work as part of ARDS Network 2 and with Emergency Department-based clinical trials, the California Network has significant expertise that is highly relevant to the current RFA. We have a major research focus on clinical criteria to identify patients at risk for ARDS prior to the initiation of positive pressure ventilation as well as a longstanding preclinical and clinical focu on novel therapeutics for ARDS. In fact, Dr. Matthay is the Principal Investigator for an ongoing NHLBI-funded phase 1/2a clinical trial of allogeneic, bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells for patients with moderate to severe ARDS that will be completed prior to the start of the PETAL Network. We are proposing two clinical protocols, one for patients with early lung injury prior to the development of ARDS that can be identified in the Emergency Department and one for patients in the Intensive Care Unit for severe ARDS. The first protocol is a phase 3 trial to test the therapeutic value of intravenous recombinant human keratinocyte growth factor in patients with early lung injury before they have met criteria for ARDS. These patients will be primarily identified in the Emergency Departments when they have bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on the chest radiograph and the need for more than 2 liters of supplemental oxygen, but do not yet require positive pressure ventilation. The second protocol is a phase 2b trial to test the potential therapeutic value of allogeneic, bone marrow-derived human mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mm Hg) in the Intensive Care Unit."

"9323179","PROJECT 1. EARLY TREATMENT RESEARCH PROJECT: Circulating Reservoirs While current antiretroviral therapy (ART) can effectively suppress HIV replication and prolong life of infected individuals, the virus persists in a latent state, only to re-emerge when ART is stopped. Without biomarkers that can accurately and consistently predict either time to viral rebound after ART discontinuation, the assessment of HIV remission will require the interruption of ART. Our Revealing Reservoirs during Rebound (R3) program will take the next steps in finding a cure for HIV by understanding how HIV persists in and populates reservoirs throughout the body. Studying people treated early after their infection who have a more preserved immune system offer a unique opportunity to reveal HIV reservoirs, especially reservoirs in circulating CD4+ T cell subsets. The Early Treatment Research Project (RP) will maximize data and samples collected from previous and ongoing ART interruption studies to determine: Aim 1: Virologic and immunologic quantities measured during ART that predict dynamics of viral rebound when ART is stopped; Aim 2: Dynamics of HIV rebounding variants populating CD4+ T cell subsets after ART interruption and decaying in subsets after re-suppression. Aim 3: Immunologic mechanisms associated with HIV persistence during ART and after ART interruption. To address these open questions, this RP will analyze data currently available from over 500 people who started ART during acute and early HIV infection and then interrupted this therapy under monitored conditions. To complement these available data, this RP will also generate and analyze longitudinally collected virologic, genetic and immunologic data from two cohorts (n=90 total) of HIV-infected individuals who also started ART during acute and early infection and then interrupted this therapy. Altogether, this RP will create considerable new knowledge about how HIV resides in circulating reservoirs, but the circulating HIV reservoir is only a part of the total full-body HIV reservoir, therefore, the insights gained in the Early Treatment RP will be investigated in conjunction with the data generated in the Late Treatment RP, which is designed to investigate the full body reservoirs. Data from both of these RP be used to develop and evaluate new analytical methods with the Quantitative Methods RP to more fully understand HIV dynamics throughout the body."

"9316604","Abstract/Project Summary Obesity-associated diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease together account for the leading cause of death in the United States. Roughly one-third of the U.S. population is obese, and it is estimated that nearly half of the population will be obese within the next two decades. To date, studies investigating the neural contribution to body weight control have focused largely on neuropeptidergic signaling in the hypothalamus, a key brain region involved in feeding behavior. However, signaling from extra-hypothalamic brain regions has also been implicated in regulating nutrient metabolism, appetite, and satiety. We recently uncovered a novel mechanism by which cholinergic signaling in the basal forebrain strongly influences body weight control. This discovery provides intriguing evidence that specific cholinergic signaling pathways in the brain critically regulate feeding behavior and body weight homeostasis. To elucidate the mechanisms by which forebrain cholinergic signaling influences body weight management, feeding behaviors, and metabolism, we will test the hypothesis that cholinergic signaling modulates metabolic and appetitive programs to regulate body weight. Using a combination conditional genetic targeting, optogenetic manipulations, electrophysiology, and behavioral analysis, we will set out to determine the role for basal forebrain cholinergic signaling in body weight control and obesity."
"9330464","ABSTRACT The activation of the gonadotropic axis requires the pulsatile release of the hypothalamic decapeptide GnRH. Reproduction is thwarted in the absence of these pulses. Despite this critical feature of GnRH release, the nature of the central mechanisms that govern this pulsatile release remain unknown. In recent years, Kiss1 neurons of the arcuate nucleus have been posed as likely candidates to hold this pulse generator through the coordinated action of its co-transmitters tachykinin neurokinin B (NKB) and dyrorphin A (Dyn), which has led these neurons to be termed KNDy neurons. I propose a model in which NKB stimulates and Dyn inhibits kisspeptin release from KNDy neurons leading to a pulsatile pattern that would then be translated into GnRH, and therefore LH, pulses. However, we have recently documented that other tachykinins (substance P, SP and neurokinin A, NKA) can activate KNDy neurons, adding an additional complex layer to this model. Importantly, recent studies in rodents and monkeys indicate that the action of tachykinins to induce LH release happens at the level of KNDy neurons and is therefore kisspeptin-dependent. However, we have recently observed that in the presence of circulating estradiol (E2) levels, both NKB and SP evoke a potent increase in LH release in a kisspeptin-independent manner, which compromises the previous model. Importantly, KNDy neurons and GnRH neurons (albeit to a lesser extend) express the receptors for SP (Tacr1) and NKB (Tacr3), suggesting that tachykinins may be able to act at both neuronal levels to induce LH release under the right sex steroid conditions. The overall goal of this proposal is to characterize the role of each tachykinin in the frequency and amplitude of LH pulses in the mouse at the KNDy neuron vs GnRH neuron using a series of complementary functional, neuroanatomical and genetic studies. The successful completion of this proposal will offer new strategies to treat reproductive disorders affecting GnRH secretion."
"9395705","ABSTRACT: RAS mutations occur in one-third of all human cancers and confer a poor prognosis with a high risk of recurrence. Oncogenic KRAS mutations are particularly common among non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer, which are frequently treated with radiation therapy. These genetic alterations have been associated with radiation resistance, which often contributes to therapy failure for these common malignancies. The underlying mechanism by which KRAS-mediated resistance to ionizing radiation occurs is poorly understood, but has been proposed to be mediated via a cell-autonomous signaling mechanism. Using genetically engineered mouse models of primary soft tissue sarcomas, my preliminary data demonstrate that Kras-mutant tumors respond poorly to radiation compared to Kras wild-type tumors in an immune system- dependent manner. To understand the role of myeloid cells in the radiation response of Kras-mutant tumors, I will apply Cre-LoxP technology to generate Kras-mutant and Kras-wild type tumors while manipulating specific subsets of myeloid cells. The long-term goal of this project is to elucidate and harness mechanisms of radiation resistance to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy in the clinic. The primary objective of this project is to dissect the role of immune cells in the radiation response of Kras-driven tumors by genetically manipulating myeloid cells. By improving our understanding of the role of Kras mutations in the immune response to radiation therapy, a critical mechanism of radiation resistance will be defined. Evaluating the role of the immune system in the radiation response of primary cancers will help determine the viability of targeting the immune system to improve the efficacy of radiation therapy in the clinic."
"9323177","Core B. Clinical and Anatomical Pathology Core: Abstract The Clinical and Anatomic Pathology Core (CAP, Core B) will provide critical infrastructure support to the proposed `Revealing Reservoirs during Rebound' (R3) program. While antiretroviral treatment (ART) can effectively suppress HIV replication and prolong life of infected individuals, the virus persists in a latent state, only to re-emerge when ART is stopped. HIV-infected persons who interrupt their ART, offer a valuable opportunity to better understand how HIV persists throughout the body. The CAP Core is one of three Cores providing support services to R3 scientific Research Projects (RPs) to improve program efficiency. Overall, the CAP Core will oversee the collection, transportation, processing, and storage of biological samples from both existing cohorts and prospectively identified cohorts. Specifically, the Early Treatment RP will provide biological samples from existing and ongoing cohorts of HIV-infected individuals who initiated ART early after infection (Zurich Primary Infection Cohort and AIDS Clinical Trials Group A5345), had fully suppressed viremia for at least 48 weeks, and who later stopped therapy. The Late Treatment RP will evaluate biological samples collected from a prospectively recruited cohort of altruistic HIV-infected individuals on ART who have a terminal illness (e.g. solid organ cancer, cardiovascular disease) and who will voluntarily stop their ART before they die and then donate their bodies to the program (the `Last Gift' cohort). All of these samples will be used to measure cellular and tissue reservoirs of HIV to best understand how HIV reservoirs persist during ART and after voluntary ART interruption. Biological samples collected from the Early Treatment RP (blood plasma and PBMC) and Late Treatment RP (blood and full body tissues) participants will constitute the R3 Biorepository, managed by the CAP Core. The CAP Core will also support all clinical activities related to the Last Gift cohort including study enrollment, management, specimen collection, and post-mortem autopsy to address viral rebound patterns across a wide variety of tissue samples and will ensure that procedures related to biological specimen collection are safe and ethical. Overall, the CAP Core will address the following Specific Aims: 1) Support the Early Treatment RP with specimen shipping, storage and management; 2) Support Late Treatment Research RP with management of the Last Gift cohort; 3) Support Late Treatment RP with specimen shipping, storage and management from Last Gift cohort; and 4) Support the R3 Biorepository. The CAP Core will work collaboratively with the program RP and Cores to support coordinated development of the R3 Biorepository and appropriate access to research specimens.

Although continuous antidepressant treatment reduces relapse and symptom recurrence, early treatment discontinuation is common and slows recovery. There is a pressing need to develop new, acceptable, and easily implemented strategies to optimize treatment continuity and improve the clinical course of adults with major depressive disorder. In several medical contexts, direct patient financial incentives increase beneficial health behaviors, including medication adherence. Yet uncertainty exists over the durability of behavior change that is effected by financial incentives and the optimal design of such incentives. In the care of major depressive disorder, it may only be necessary to provide incentives early in treatment until the patients' mood begins to lift and treatment adherence becomes self-reinforcing. This pilot study tests two theory different incentive schedules for daily antidepressant adherence. It will compare usual care with either modest time-limited escalating or de-escalating financial incentives with respect to their effects on daily antidepressant adherence and depressive symptoms among non-elderly depressed adults initiating antidepressant treatment. The primary aims are 1) to compare short-term (6 weeks) effects of financial incentives on adherence to antidepressant treatment, depressive symptoms, and quality of life; 2) to determine whether the incentives, which end at 6 weeks, continue at 12 weeks to influence these patient outcomes; and 3) to assess potential negative effects of the incentives on perceived coercion, regret over study participation, trust in the treating psychiatrist, and patient participation in depression care. We will also explore whether present bias and risk aversion moderate the effectiveness of the two incentive schedules. Adult mental health outpatients ( N -= 120) with major depressive disorder who have been prescribed antidepressants will be randomly assigned to: 1) usual care, 2) usual care and escalating daily rewards for daily antidepressant treatment ($2, $3, $4, $5, $6, and $7 in weeks 1 through 6) or 3) usual care and de-escalating incentives from $7/day to $2/day for each day of antidepressant adherence with weekly decrements. Daily antidepressant adherence will be measured with a wireless electronic pill bottle, patient self-report, and physician orders. Baseline, six week, and twelve week assessments will be performed of depressive symptoms, quality of life, perceived coercion, regret over study participation, trust in the treating psychiatrist, and participation in depression care. The results of this pilot study will yield important new information on cognitive and motivational barriers to antidepressant adherence in major depressive disorder.  "
"9277660","RESOURCE INFORMATICS ? PROJECT SUMMARY The creation, advancement and maintenance of the GENCODE resource requires both adherence to and optimization of defined processes that ensure the genome annotation created now and in the future will always be of the same or better standard compared to what has already been created. The GENCODE resource must also be attuned to the new technologies and opportunities that arise as the field of genomics evolves. A primary objective of the GENCODE resource is to ensure quality control (QC) and data validation of annotations. Ensembl will compare the GENCODE gene set to other gene sets (e.g. UniProt) to check for missing genes or transcripts; CNIO will validate the coding genes; the CNIO/CNIC proteomics pipeline will validates the gene models; CNIO/CNIC will perform manual verification for QC of proteomics data. Project stability will be ensured through a well-maintained computational infrastructure, adequate QC processes that will ensure the highest possible quality, as well as regular releases of freely available annotation in high value formats. The annotation curation for human and mouse will be completed, in particular the existing human partial transcript models will be extended to full length, expanding the human lncRNA annotation, as well as the completion of the initial full pass of the mouse annotation. GENCODE will incorporate individual genome representation and population data represented by available human variation data at both the sequence level (e.g. 1000 Genomes) and at the transcriptomic level (e.g. GTEx), and by the 16 mouse strain genomes produced by the Mouse Genomes Project led by the WTSI. Data from individuals and populations will be annotated. A personal genome resource will be developed, which will produce an accurate representation of an individual's gene set. Two pilot projects will help to define the most effective way to support future GENCODE annotations. The first pilot project will use GENCODE's experience in developing population reference genome graphs to pilot a scalable and potentially universal approach to population based genome annotation. The second pilot project will focus on connecting regulatory regions to regulated genes. GENCODE will enhance the current annotation of genes with their regulatory elements so that the annotation is dependent on tissue and cell type. The demand for manual annotation of transcripts across strains and species may outstrip GENCODE's ability to provide such services via existing mechanisms, therefore a system to enable the submission of annotated data will be developed. The described measures will ensure that GENCODE in 2020 will be significantly more valuable for research and clinical applications in genomics than today."
"9376071","PROJECT SUMMARY This P50 application represents a novel interdisciplinary center at the intersection of behavioral economics and implementation science in pursuit of improving mental health service delivery.

"9302840","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The Denver Museum of Nature & Science (Museum) proposes a four-year science education project to investigate the role that degree of citizen science participation has on the learning experience and research outcomes of public participation in science research (PPSR) programs. The long-term objective of the project is to contribute to establishing a best practice for citizen science projects in the content area of human health to better inform the design of future projects in PPSR, both in the Museum's lab, and, importantly, in various settings across the field. This project will take place in the Museum' community-based Genetics of Taste Laboratory (Lab), a unique venue for both citizen science and crowdsourcing health data. These two important aspects of PPSR help to not only serve as entry points for public education about health research, but concurrently serve to advance the creation of new knowledge in the field of public health, making it an ideal venue to conduct this proposed work. The proposed research, education, and evaluation project will assess the quality of citizen science participation, barriers to participation for traditionally underrepresened communities in STEM, and scientific outcomes when gradually building from a collaborative PPSR project to a project that is fully co-created with citizen scientist volunteers. To do so, we will employ both learning research techniques and logic model-based evaluation strategies. With the Lab as the foundation for public engagement, we will conduct four scientific research studies over the course of the science education/learning research project. Each scientific study will be designed to systematically employ a higher degree of citizen scientist participation. At each stage of increased participation will propose asking how citizen scientists are engaging and learning, for whom does this occur, how we can better understand and overcome barriers to participation, and the impact on scientific rigor/quality of data and output. By assessing learning and participation in each stage of engagement in a real and authentic scientific process-from study selection to data collection to data analysis and dissemination-we can move the field closer to its full potential of high-level diverse public participation linked to stronger learning outcomes for participants AND scientific data that is sufficiently precise and accurate for peer-reviewed publications. Successful completion of this project will advance the field of citizen science in two key ways: 1) it will provide pathways for how to strategically integrate all aspects of the scientific research process into PPSR programs while maintaining scientific integrity, and 2) suggest ways to overcome barriers for participation in the various aspects of PPSR, especially among groups historically underrepresented in STEM."

"9376075","PROJECT SUMMARY  This project uses a behavioral economic approach to target implementation of evidence-based practice at the organizational level and harnesses collaboration between our group and the City of Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health. We will partner with stakeholders to develop organizational-level implementation strategies that leverage established principles from behavioral economics to improve evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation in public mental health. In our work investigating the implementation of EBP over the past five years, clinic leaders and policy makers have repeatedly stated that the most significant barrier to the implementation of EBP is the low organizational financial investment, a function of an under-resourced mental health system.3,4 Our findings corroborate hypotheses drawn from implementation science frameworks that acknowledge the importance of outer context factors like funding for implementation. Our work leverages this information and the fact that health care payers are increasingly instituting pay-for-performance schemes. Our goal is to engage in formative work to design incentive-based implementation strategies that target organizations. While the literature on pay-for-performance strongly supports paying individuals to change their behavior, most systems are paying organizations to change individual behavior. The experimental evidence about the effectiveness of organizational pay-for-performance is mixed. This may be due to design of organizational pay-for-performance programs. They have not used principles of behavioral economics to change behavior, nor have they been developed with stakeholder input. Thus, this exploratory project will take the first steps toward applying behavioral economics principles to the development of organizational-level incentive-oriented implementation strategies in collaboration with stakeholders. Our objective in this exploratory project is to collaboratively develop implementation strategies in partnership with community mental health agency leadership, payers and policy-makers to increase the use of EBP with fidelity in community mental health using discrete choice experiment, a method hailing out of the participatory design approach. The results of this study will inform the next proposal in which we plan to evaluate the effectiveness of implementation strategies that we develop based upon principles of behavioral economics and target the behavior of leaders of organizations. The next studies include an R01 comparative effectiveness trial testing the developed implementation strategies versus active comparators therapist fidelity and client outcomes; with an emphasis on mechanisms, consistent with the NIMH experimental therapeutics approach.  "
"9359532","Summary  Project 2 will test the hypothesis that injury to the renal papilla as documented by our papillary injury grading system (PGS) will reflect and predict stone disease, specifically we will determine the influence of intrinsic patient factors such as renal physiology and stone passage events, as well as on the influence of extrinsic patient factors, particularly surgical treatments. To investigate the time course of papillary disease, we will quantify the extent of papillary changes in a co-hort of pediatric calcium stone formers. We will test the hypothesis that our PGS will predict calcium stone type, as well as the relative percentage of calcium phosphate present in stones. In a related hypothesis, we will test whether application of the PGS is able to predict calcium stone type as classified by formation pattern (tubular plugging vs plaque overgrowth). We hypothesize that papilla with high injury scores will correlate with renal injury as quantified by cimetidine blocked creatinine clearance and microalbuminuria. We have documented that tubular plugging is histologically associated with significant inflammatory changes in the papilla. We will test the hypothesis that these changes will be reflected by elevated levels of inflammatory markers in urine, as well as tissue. We have previously documented that percantage of Randall's plaque papillary coverage correlates directly with stone activity. We will determine whether papillary injury is also associated with stone activity. Finally, we will test the hypothesis that inflammation secondary to ductal plugging is associated with chronic flank pain in the setting of non-obstructing renal stones and, further, whether the treatment of such stones is associated with improvement in patient symptoms.

"9350253","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Epidemiologic and scientific research shows that obesity has a significant influence on the risk of developing colorectal cancer. However, associations between adiposity and colorectal cancer (CRC) prognosis are less convincing. While some studies have found severely obese patients (BMI, e35 kg/m2) to have an increased risk of recurrence and/or death, most studies have found no association between body mass index (BMI) or weight gain after diagnosis and CRC prognosis. The lack of consistent findings between BMI and colorectal cancer endpoints may be due in part to the fact that BMI may be a poor surrogate for body composition in the context of illness. Adipose tissue and muscle mass exert powerful but different endocrine, immune, and hormonal influences within the body. Though overweight persons tend to have both higher amounts of lean and fat mass, low levels of muscle mass may be present in overweight or obese people; sarcopenia (muscle wasting) is common among cancer survivors, even in the presence of fat gain. Therefore, we propose to use abdominal CT scans collected as part of routine staging and surveillance both at diagnosis and 1-2 years after diagnosis, to assess fat and muscle mass and to examine the relationship of body composition to CRC survival in a cohort of persons (n=3546) diagnosed between 2005 and 2010 with Stage I-III invasive colorectal cancer (CRC) at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). Specifically, we will examine the level of muscle wasting (sarcopenia) and excess fat mass (FM) in CRC survivors at diagnosis (Aim 1), the association between FM and muscle mass at diagnosis and CRC survival (Aim 2), whether changes in FM and muscle mass measured between diagnosis and 1 to 2 years after diagnosis vary by weight change post-diagnosis (Aim 3), and whether changes in FM and muscle mass measured between diagnosis and 1 to 2 years after diagnosis are associated with CRC survival (Aim 4). This study uses a novel, state-of-the art tool to collect more accurate measures of body composition than standard measures of height and weight, and could provide important insight into the role of energy balance and body composition in cancer survival. This study will enable identification of CRC patients who are at high risk for muscle wasting and may improve our understanding of why BMI is related to incident CRC but not CRC outcomes. The use of CT scans to assess fat/muscle mass could easily be done in the clinical or epidemiologic setting, adding an important physiologic measure to BMI to help target and personalize weight control strategies and other treatments to prevent muscle mass loss, potentially improving survival. Findings from this study may thus lead to altered clinical practice. Additionally, insights regarding the role of fat/muscle mass in CRC prognosis may provide new avenues for future research about the role of energy balance in cancer survival"
"9328906","Project Summary Type 1 diabetes (T1D) results in the immune-mediated destruction of insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. As such, immune intervention to prevent, delay, or reverse T1D is an appealing therapeutic approach. Development of an antigen-specific intervention that targets the diabetogenic immune response without compromising systemic immunity is complicated by an expanding list of antigenic targets in T1D. Recently, novel, post-translationally modified hybrid fusion peptides generated at the site of autoimmune attack in the islet have also been identified as potent autoantigens. Thus, development of effective antigen-based therapy requires not only antigen identification, but also an understanding the unique antigen processing environment facilitated by the islet itself. This proposal seeks to identify the effects of lymphocyte metabolism on T-B interactions in T1D. Hypoxia is a potent regulator of B cell proliferation and expansion at the site of T-B interactions in the germinal center of primary lymphoid organs. Germinal centers also form in the islets during autoimmune attack; however, the effect of hypoxia on islet germinal centers is not known. These germinal centers are formed within areas of lymphocytic infiltrate, termed insulitis. Interestingly, not all insulitis lesions progress to beta cell death. Given the highly vascularized nature of the islet needed to accommodate the metabolic demand associated with insulin secretion, it is possible that the islet?s distinct metabolic microenvironment influences T and B cell interactions at the site of autoimmune attack in the pancreas. The proposed research will test the hypothesis that the sites of T-B cell interactions in the islet are metabolically distinct from those of primary lymphoid organs and that the metabolic profiles of infiltrating lymphocytes are differentially regulated to develop autoaggressive or regulatory phenotypes that either drive or protect against the development of T1D. In aim 1, we will assess how the metabolic environment in the islet shapes the immune effector response as diabetes progresses. A unique hypoxia probe will be used to assess changes in islet oxygen tension and a combination of metabolic phenotyping and real-time bioenergetic analysis will be used to identify changes in cellular energy sources throughout the disease process. In aim 2, transgenic NOD mouse models will be used to delineate the metabolic parameters that distinguish innocuous from destructive insulitis. These studies will identify characteristic metabolic features of autoimmunity and tolerance in T1D -- differences that may be harnessed for future therapeutic interventions."
"9314295","?     DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that an additional four million health workers will be needed to address the global shortfall of health workers. This shortage is especially hard felt in Africa, which has approximately 11% of the world's population and 24% of the world's disease burden, but only 1% of its doctors, nurses and midwives. Task shifting, which involves the redistribution of tasks from highly skilled health workers to less highly skilled health workers, is emphasized in policy circles as a solution to the  problem of shortage of skilled medical professionals. This policy has gained considerable momentum and an increasing number of African countries have expanded production of mid-level health professionals. The appeal of mid- level providers is easy to understand: if a less skilled worker can do the same work (with comparable results) as a more highly skilled provider at a lower cost, then it makes sense to expand the production of such workers. There is however limited data and evidence for whether the substitution of more highly skilled health providers with less highly skilled workers influences quality, safety, and patient outcomes. In thi R01, we randomly assign providers with different levels of training to primary health care clinics and study the effect on a range of maternal and child health outcomes. This will to our knowledge be the only existing randomized trial in which providers with varying levels of training/skill are assigned to a health facility to provide primary health care services. We combine randomized provider assignment with a randomized offer to participate in a conditional cash transfer. This unique design allows us to address the issue of non-random patient sorting and to provide some evidence about the extent to which supply-side barriers (such as provider skill) may help explain why increased use of services (as a result of demand-side programs) has not translated into the anticipated improvements in health outcomes."

Individuals with SMI die 25 years earlier, on average, than the general population and are designated a health disparity population by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors. While the Internet provides exciting opportunities to support person-centered health care, web-based resources may convey new barriers and, consequently, contribute to even greater health disparities for individuals with SMI. For those with limited access to computers, mobile devices may provide promising opportunities to enhance Internet access, if resources are appropriately designed and accessible. Specific Aims include: (1) Employ user experience design to make strategic recommendations for eMH redesign including the eMH4me training module and the eMH Bridges component prototypes. We will conduct structured, systematic reviews by experts and users of existing eHealth information resources (n < 20) including the current eMH resource; two focus groups of users with SMI (n < 20) to ensure the selection of appropriate content, level of complexity, and technology; and a review of eMH web analytics data from the previous 12 months. Design recommendations will comprise the eMH Strategic Plan to inform next project phases. (2) Conduct in-person usability testing to develop the fully functional eMH4me and eMH Bridges prototypes. We will conduct iterative, side-by-side sessions with individuals with SMI in the laboratory or office environment (n = 20). Appropriate modifications will be made, based on testing, to finalize the prototypes. (3) Conduct remote testing of the acceptability and feasibilit of the eMH4me and eMH Bridges prototypes with individuals with SMI (n = 100) with access to the resources for two months, to assess satisfaction, usefulness, and ease of use and learning. We will obtain feedback via telephone interviews with a purposive subsample of these users (n = 20); and evaluate usage metrics. Findings will inform refinements to eMH4me and eMH Bridges. Final products will also include the eMH Satisfaction Survey and Quality Metrics Profile for ongoing use. eMental Health will be actively sustained by long-standing partners, and will be an essential resource to individuals, organizations and institutions across the country committed to improving health outcomes for individuals with SMI."
"9498629","?    DESCRIPTION:  Micellar nanoparticles that mimic the size and shape of viral particles are attractive as a DNA delivery vehicle because of their improved colloidal stability and transport properties, ability to evade immune clearance, and high payload packaging capacity. Moreover, nanoparticle shape has explicitly been identified as an important factor determining their transport properties and delivery efficiency. However, there is no available nanoparticle synthesis method for packaging plasmid DNA payloads while allowing sufficient control over particle size and shape. Recently, we have shown that distinct shape control and tuning for DNA micelles can be achieved through complexation of plasmid DNA with engineered block or graft copolymers of polycation and poly (ethylene glycol) under controlled assembly conditions. In this proposed study, we will develop a synergistic research program comprising parallel and integrated experimental and computational strategies to (1) develop and understand new methods for DNA micelle assembly that permit scalable, high-uniformity synthesis with shape control and high stability; (2) reveal shape-dependent nanoparticle diffusion and transport properties in physiologically media in vitro and in vivo; and (3) demonstrate the delivery efficiency of a theranostic vector by shape-controlled DNA micelles and their imaging and therapeutic efficacy using mouse models of human metastatic cancers. The proposed study brings together a unique combination of expertise in DNA nanoparticle assembly, microfluidics-based single-particle analysis/fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, in vivo imaging, cancer theranostics, and computer simulations to address a crucial knowledge gap in the engineering and delivery of DNA nano-therapeutics. It will not only offer a new, generalizable method for synthesizing shape-controlled DNA micelles, but also provide a mechanistic understanding of shape- dependent transport properties of nanoparticles. Moreover, the integrated nature of our experimental and computational approach establishes a new paradigm that will greatly accelerate the discovery and development of new DNA nanoparticle systems for efficient gene medicine delivery."
"9319889","ABSTRACT ? Project 1 (Leader: Dr. Ann Chahroudi, Emory University) Worldwide, there are currently 1.8 million children living with HIV and ~150,000 new pediatric infections per year, approximately half of which occur due to HIV transmission during breastfeeding. While antiretroviral therapy (ART) greatly reduces mortality and morbidity of HIV infection, viral rebound quickly ensues if ART is interrupted. Understanding the virologic and immunologic drivers of HIV rebound and identifying biomarkers that predict rebound is essential for the design and evaluation of interventions that aim to achieve HIV remission. Inducing HIV remission in infected infants is a highly sought-after outcome, given the fact infected infants currently must remain on daily ART from the time of diagnosis through their entire life span. The overall goal of this Program project application is to investigate virus rebound in the setting of postnatal breast milk transmission in a highly relevant animal model. The objectives of Project 1 are i) to determine the anatomic sources of the persistent virus reservoir in infants that contribute to rebound following treatment interruption, and ii) to identify virologic and immunologic biomarkers that predict the time to virus rebound in infants. The central hypothesis is that virus rebound in SHIV-infected infant rhesus macaques originates from CD4+ T cell subsets in the gastrointestinal tract and/or associated lymph nodes and that on-ART biomarkers can be used as a surrogate indicator of virus rebound kinetics. A key feature of this proposal is that, by using our novel, highly relevant animal model of SHIV infection and ART treatment, we are able to perform in-depth analyses of virus reservoirs and treatment interruption that would be impossible to conduct in pediatric participants. Project 1 has the following Specific Aims: 1) To define the kinetics and anatomic origin of virus rebound in orally SHIV-infected animal model; 2) To identify signature sequences of virus variants in cellular and anatomic reservoirs on ART that contribute to rebound viremia following treatment interruption in our animal model; and 3) To identify virologic and immunologic biomarkers that predict the time to virus rebound in our animal model. This Project will achieve these Aims through interaction with all other Program components, and thus will contribute to the Program's goal to inform design of strategies to induce prolonged remission in postnatally infected infants. We expect the findings from this Project and the Program as a whole to critically inform HIV cure efforts in the pediatric population."
"9378044","Project Summary/Abstract  Regulated proteolysis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (ubiquitin system) plays essential roles in a multitude of biological processes and has major ramifications for human health and disease, including illnesses that range from cancer and neurodegeneration to cardiovascular syndromes and defects of immunity. Our studies of the ubiquitin-proteasome system and the ubiquitin-dependent N-end rule pathway over the last three decades were made possible, to a large extent, by the present grant (DK039520-30), currently in its 31st year of support. The N-end rule pathway recognizes proteins containing N-terminal degradation signals called N-degrons, polyubiquitylates these proteins and thereby causes their degradation by the proteasome. Recognition components of the N-end rule pathway are called N-recognins. In eukaryotes, N-recognins are E3 ubiquitin ligases that can target N-degrons. The eukaryotic N-end rule pathway consists of three branches. The first branch, called the Arg/N-end rule pathway, targets specific unacetylated N-terminal residues of protein substrates. This branch, discovered by our laboratory in 1986, continues to be a fount of biological insights. The second branch, called the Ac/N-end rule pathway, was discovered by our laboratory in 2010. This pathway recognizes proteins that bear N-terminally acetylated residues. The third branch of the N-end rule pathway, termed the Pro/N-end rule pathway, has emerged through unpublished studies, over the last two years, by our laboratory. This proteolytic pathway is mediated by the previously known ubiquitin ligase called GID and recognizes the N-terminal proline (Pro) residue of a protein and an adjoining sequence motif.  The present (DK039520) renewal application focuses on these (latest) advances and the largely unexplored Pro/N-end rule pathway, in both yeast and mammals. Its biological functions include the regulation of physiologically important transitions between cellular states that require de novo synthesis of glucose (for example, starvation or semi-starvation states) and conditions of ample glucose availability. The Pro/N-end rule pathway has other functions as well, which are beginning to emerge, in part through our recent identification of non-gluconeogenic proteins that are either targeted by or interact with the Pro/N-end rule pathway, in both yeast and mammals. These and related yeast and mammalian studies, described in Specific Aims of the present renewal application, will advance the understanding of protein degradation and the universally present N-end rule pathway."
"9280964","Core - Improved High-resolution cryo-EM Methodology  Jamie Cate and Kenneth Downing  PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT   The capabilities of cryo-EM have begun to match or surpass those of X-ray crystallography in many areas  of structural biology. However, there remain crucial bottlenecks in cryo-EM that hamper reconstructions of  fragile complexes. The goal of this Core Project is to develop methods that will further enhance the capabilities  of cryo-EM, in order to support the work of the Projects and Associated Projects of this Program. We address  two key areas where single-particle cryo-EM requires further improvement.   We will first address the cryo-preservation of delicate samples on cryo-EM grids. Many samples are subject  to denaturation when exposed to the extensive air-water interface during blotting, or to a continuous carbon  grid. To prepare specimens in a more structure-friendly way by avoiding specimen contact with the air-water  interface, streptavidin monolayer crystals will be used as a specimen-support film for affinity-binding  interactions. We will test a series of affinity adaptor and affinity tagging methods, to ensure uniform particle  orientations on the streptavidin monolayer crystal lattice. These experiments will demonstrate the general utility  of using streptavidin monolayer crystals as a support material.   Second, we will develop means to correct beam-induced sample movement. When using direct electron  detectors in ?movie? mode, the initial frames of exposures are presently discarded, although they potentially  contain the highest resolution information. In subsequent frames, the high-resolution information is no longer  available due to electron beam induced damage. We propose to use the image of the streptavidin support film  as a fiducial, to better characterize the frame-to-frame motions that occur.   We will use human 48S translation preinitiation complexes and Escherichia coli 70S ribosomes as test  systems to validate the methods in these two aims. Once we have established these methods, they will be of  wide use in the cryo-EM community, and should greatly expand the scope of cryo-EM into areas of structural  biology that were previously inaccessible, or accessible only to x-ray crystallography."

The core also supports the Center's Pilot Project Award program, which will be available to social scientists  based around the world to develop new research into the causative drivers of health disparities, healthy  aging, and longevity; to establish collaborations for comparative research outside of Center; and for  established population health investigators who would like to pursue new interdisciplinary research in aging and  social science-related topics. Two examples of potential pilot projects include (i) Analysis of distal and  intermediate health disparities and their determinants in the United Kingdom; and (ii) Understanding the  relationship between income and health outcomes across ages and counties. Finally, the Center will  cultivate a new generation of leading academic investigators situated at the intersection of population health,  economics, and social science disciplines by providing the support, training and mentoring for post-graduate  fellows and other incipient researchers to progress towards research independence. One post-graduate  researcher will be selected annually through a global, competitive application to apply their social science  expertise to population health research in order to become independent academic faculty with research  interests consistent with the Center's aims."
"9319038","Summary  Hypertension is a major public health problem, affecting 1 billion people and contributing to death from heart attacks and strokes, the #1 and #3 causes of death in the US. We have used genetic and genomic approaches to identify genes and pathways that underlie this trait, and have identified renal salt handling as a principal determinant of human blood pressure. This work has unexpectedly identified new layers of physiologic regulation that are involeved in orchestrating the activities of diverse electrolyte flux pathways. These new mechanisms reveal that the kidney explicitly regulates the balance between renal salt reabsorption and K+ secretion via regulated activity of WNK kinases, whose level and activity is regulated by volume depletion. We have recently identified two new genes that play key roles in this pathway- these encode KLHL3 and CUL3, partners in an ubiquitin ligase complex. Mutation of either results in a similar phenotype to that resulting from WNK mutations. We have shown that this ubiquitin ligase targets WNKs for degradation and is regulated by phosphorylation. We are defining the biochemistry of this signaling pathway, its regulation by changes in volume and potassium homeostasis, and will produce new models that recapitulate the human disease, allowing further determination of the mechanisms by which this pathway imparts its effects. As part of this effort, we have made an unexpected discovery that has implications both for hypertension and also for the broader nuclear hormone receptor field. We have identified a novel phoshorylation site in the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) that regulates the ability of MR to bind ligand. This site is exclusively phosphorylated in renal intercalated cells, and is modulated in opposite directions by volume depletion and hyperkalemia; dephosphorylation by AII signaling is WNK4-dependent and increases expression of electrolyte flux pathways in intercalated cells that increase electroneutral salt reabsorption. We will identify the kinase mediating this phosphorylation and elucidate the responsible signaling pathway. We are making a mouse model with inducible loss of phosphorylation in intercalated cells, which will reveal the role of this pathway in blood pressure and electrolyte homestasis."
"9312975","The overall goal of the Enrichment Program is to enhance the University of Michigan Center for Gastrointestinal Research (UMCGR) environment by promoting education and fostering research synergy through communication amongst its members. The Enrichment Program also helps provide the UMCGR with an institutional and national identity. The UMCGR educational programs have been a driving force for strengthening the Center research environment since they bring new information and pioneering scientific approaches to UMCGR investigators and provide an outlet for communication of the Center with the greater University of Michigan scientific community. This vocation of the Center is pivotal in developing new research directions by providing extramural speakers and seminars on new technological advances and opportunities. The programs enhance our scientific environment by providing constructive feedback to UMCGR members, and motivate (and support) young investigators to pursue research in digestive, liver and pancreatic diseases. Enrichment activities also provide robust opportunities for UMCGR members to meet and participate in educational activities such as lectures, retreats, and workshops. Trainees of UMCGR members meet regularly at two weekly conferences (GI Basic and Translational Research Conference and Joint Gut Microbiome conference) attended by UMCGR members and investigators from other departments, discussing their work and sharing latest high impact journal articles, as well as didactic academic skills sessions. UMCGR members and their trainees also benefit from extramural networking opportunities through our bimonthly visiting professor series and by receiving valuable input from external senior scientists. In addition, a highly successful annual retreat for Center Investigators, gastrointestinal fellows, graduate students and postdoctoral fellows is sponsored by the UMCGR Enrichment Program. This 2 day event begins on the first day with an academic workshop and an educational talk given by our Yamada Lectureship speaker, and the second day mini theme symposium features invited scholar talks, and the keynote Yamada Lectureship presentation. We also have poster sessions highlighting research performed by Center investigators and Pilot Feasibility Studies awardees. Finally, the Enrichment Program has been instrumental in helping to launch the Midwest DDRC Alliance by hosting the first two years of an academic workshop and scientific meeting of faculty and pilot/feasibility recipients of members (University of Michigan, University of Chicago, Mayo, University of Cincinnati, and Washington University) in Ann Arbor in January of 2013 and 2014."
"9357649","Project 3 Summary In this, Project 3, of an interinstitutional collaboration our goal is to understand the molecular mechanisms that underlie the brittle bone that is the hallmark of the heritable disorder, osteogenesis imperfecta (OI). Our focus is on the collagen matrix of bone which determines the material toughness of the tissue and the template in which the mineral is deposited during bone formation. During the first 5-year period in collaboration with Projects 1 and 2 we have discovered, by analyzing bone and other tissue collagens from mouse models and human OI cases, a strong interplay between the mechanisms of collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation and lysyl hydroxylation in the control of collagen cross-linking quality and predictably bone strength. Going forward we plan to define the molecular basis for this. Our methods remain focused on using analytical tandem mass spectrometry as a tool to interrogate and compare abnormal collagen structures from various genetic forms of OI. The significance extends to a better understanding of brittle bone more generally with potential for new therapeutic molecular targets and diagnostic methods."
"9309796","Project Summary/Abstract This is a revised application (formerly called a competing supplement) to request support for a significant expansion of 1R01NS094387-01 Longitudinal Assessment of Brain Structure and Function in Myotonic Dystrophy Type 1 (DM1), from here on referred to as the `parent brain study'. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a genetic disease caused by a trinucleotide (CTG) repeat expansion in the dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) gene. It is a multisystem disorder however the hallmark symptoms are that of myotonia (prolonged contraction/poor relaxation after contraction), and muscle weakness. In DM1, muscle function may be affected by several components: pure muscle weakness, myotonia, muscle fatigue. Importantly, DM1 is progressive with worsening function over time and a pattern in which peripheral musculature is affected first, followed by proximal muscles being affected. In addition to the muscle symptoms, there has been recent focus on the need to better understand CNS involvement in DM1 as families have reported that some of the most disabling symptoms of the disease are cognitive and behavioral changes. As a single-gene disorder, DM1 has the distinct advantage of the opportunity for `root-cause' treatment or prevention via gene therapy. The effectiveness of gene therapy using Antisense Oligonucleotides (ASOs) in treatment of an animal model of DM1 has been shown, and the Phase I human trials have already begun. This has highlighted an urgent need to identify biomarkers that are: 1) disease-specific and clinically relevant; and 2) can track disease progression. The parent brain imaging grant is focused on evaluating biomarkers for DM1 effects on brain while the revised application will be focused on evaluating biomarkers for DM1 effects on muscle. The revised muscle application will directly `piggy-back' onto the parent brain study by utilizing the same patients, controls, and longitudinal design. Given that the parent brain study is early in its course, this provides a unique opportunity to expand the assessments of these rare patients, leveraging their participation and significantly enhancing the potential for important findings. The aims of the revised muscle application are essentially parallel to the parent brain study and outline the goals of a study designed for biomarker discovery:  1. Evaluation of muscle structure using MRI and muscle function using electrophysiology and quantitative  functional measures.  2. Correlation of muscle structure with muscle function, and with other disease-specific measures.  3. Longitudinal assessment to detect change over time."
"9302853","?    DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders are serious and debilitating mental illnesses that incur substantial suffering for patients and major challenges to our health care system. The clinical high-risk (CHR) prodromal phase is the period prior to the onset of psychosis when clinical symptoms gradually emerge and function declines. The presence of a CHR syndrome in young adults is associated with heightened risk (~30%) for the later development of psychosis. The North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS) and other CHR studies have made substantial progress towards predicting psychosis, and in showing an accelerated reduction in prefrontal cortex (PFC) gray matter (GM) density in CHR converters from pre- to post-psychosis onset, but the mechanisms driving conversion remain elusive, partly because no studies include repeated measures prior to the onset of psychosis. In NAPLS2, we found that disrupted resting-state (rs) thalamo- cortical functional connectivity prior to psychosis predicts conversion and correlates with rate of GM decline, but we do not know if rs-dysconnectivity is progressive during the prodrome. Furthermore, in NAPLS2, plasma markers of pro-inflammatory cytokines at baseline predicted the rate of GM loss in converters; these same markers also correlated with rs-dysconnectivity. We do not yet know whether these inflammatory markers drive the changes in brain structure/function or are consequences of these changes. Similarly, higher levels of cortisol, and lower mismatch negativity predicted psychosis and the rate of PFC GM decline and were correlated with each other and with measures of rs-connectivity and cytokines.  This application is a competitive renewal for a nine-site, longitudinal study aimed at identifying the brain processes underlying the progression of the clinical syndromes that characterize the psychosis prodrome. The goals are: 1) to determine the pre-onset trajectories of GM decline and disrupted resting-state brain connectivity in CHR individuals who develop psychosis using MRI, and 2) to identify inflammatory and plasticity mechanisms associated with transition to psychosis. Over a two-year period, the study will repeatedly measure these indicators, and at the same time examine changes in physiological indices of brain function, social and cognitive functioning, and symptom progression. The multi-site collaboration will follow large CHR (n= 378) and demographically matched comparison (n= 162) samples that will undergo comprehensive assessments of biological and behavioral changes. This approach will answer important questions about the origins of the brain changes that give rise to psychosis and will provide insights into likely approaches to halting or mitigatig the pathological process and advance our understanding of risk prediction, both critical steps in prevention."
"9318070","Abstract A natural protein molecule, scytovirin (SVN) from cyanobacteria has been found to have a strong inhibitory activity against Ebola infection. This project will utilize the anti-viral property of scytovirin and in combination with lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to build up an anti-Ebola inhibitor mucosal delivery approach for the control of Ebola infection and transmission. This bacteria-based approach will be effective because the SVN inhibitor can be directly delivered at the mucosal surfaces right at the ports of viral entry. These anti-Ebola bacteria may not only be utilized for prevention, but also for treatment. Because the LAB can colonize in human body, a long- term efficacy could be achieved. This approach is also simple and cost-effective that can be easily used and managed in the regions of Ebola outbreaks and especially in the developing countries.  "
"9278277","Abstract The regulation of anti-viral immune responses in the lung is dependent upon the ability to efficiently and appropriately recognize pathogenic signals and promote the proper and non-pathogenic response. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an especially pathogenic virus that can induce morbidity at all ages, especially in infants and those with underlying lung conditions. Our recent data published from our present funding cycle indicated that a critical innate immune pathway that is functional for regulating pathogenic immune response is autophagy. This omnipresent process provides all cells the ability to not only preserve resources but transport pathogen components to the proper immune recognition molecules. In particular, this process appears to be central for dendritic cell activation, cytokine production, and subsequent T cell activation. In this renewal, we will continue to examine the consequences of altering autophagy, including the regulation of ER stress and inflammasome activation, that leads to a distinct shift in innate cytokine profiles. We will more closely and mechanistically continue to explore the role of an autophagy inducer, Sirtuin 1, a NAD+ deactylase, and its effect on the regulation of not only the autophagy profiles, but also the direct and indirect effect it has on ER stress and inflammasome activation. Using Sirt1 -/- and inhibition along with Sirt1 overexpression and activation we will explore how the absence of Sirt1 along with the reduction of autophagy alters anti-RSV responses in vitro and in vivo. The shift in cytokine patterns induced by increased ER stress in the absence of autophagy and Sirt1 can lead to an altered pathogenic phenotype due to enhanced pathogenic T cell responses, especially IL-17. Thus, these studies will explore several novel and topical pathways that will not only further define the mechanisms that promote pulmonary mucosal immune responses, but expand our understanding of RSV infection and immunity."
"9520621","2006 as an ancillary study to the Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery (LABS) study. Long range goals are to detail the outcomes of bariatric surgery in youth over multiple decades including multigenerational effects of treatment. The immediate goals are to address important gaps in our understanding of the impact of early onset obesity and the efficacy and safety of bariatric surgery in adolescents compared to adults. The primary achievements of Teen-LABS during the first funding cycle include; 1. establishment of a strong collaborative multi-institutional working group of investigators committed to Teen-LABS, 2. defining the principal domains of the study, building on the study design of the LABS consortium, 3. establishing a functional research infrastructure including multiple committees and a data coordinating center, 4. enrollment, as of January 31, 2011, of 83% of the planned 250 adolescent and caregiver participants, 5. initiating a 2 year outcomes study, 6. supporting the needs of 11 Teen-LABS ancillary and 4 substudies. In addition to documenting the immediate trajectories of weight loss, acute changes in comorbidities, and safety of bariatric procedures in adolescents over 2 years, a thorough examination of the durability and consequences of surgery beyond 2 years will address a major gap in our understanding of the long term outcome of bariatric surgery in this high risk group of patients. In the next 5 years, the consortium will concentrate on scientifically critical research questions that cannot be addressed with the limited follow-up that currently exists. In the renewal period, Teen-LABS will examine mid- and longer-term outcomes. An extension will permit Teen-LABS to continue to collect follow-up data in parallel with the LABS consortium, now already in their second funding cycle. Teen-LABS will be expanded and establish new relationships with experts in other disciplines to permit the evaluation of myriad emerging effects of surgery in a vulnerable patient population, as well as effects that change over time, and determine whether the response to surgery in adolescent age groups differs from adults. The research approach in this proposal will focus on 1) retention strategies that will maintain the cohort, insuring availability for longer term study and 2) dissemination of research findings from baseline characterization and early outcomes. An extension of Teen-LABS will build on the already productive five center research network, representing several care delivery systems and patient populations. Teen-LABS enrolls from four academic pediatric medical centers with dedicated adolescent bariatric programs and one adult academic center with a hybrid adult-adolescent bariatric program that jointly serves as a LABS/Teen-LABS site. We have collaboratively assembled a well-phenotyped adolescent cohort with a range of patient characteristics, and undergoing state of-the-art surgical procedures. The critical scientific strengths of the multicenter Teen-LABS consortium include a diverse participant base to insure generalizability of findings, the ability to recruit a large number of subjects including important subgroups, the use of an existing research infrastructure with meticulous and high quality baseline and follow-up data collection practices, and an outstanding group of clinician scientists who continues to contribute greatly to the interpretation of the findings from the studies. The data coordinating center will continue to insure very high levels of data accuracy and completeness so that the investigators will be able to produce a long list of publications addressing important research questions with clinical significance. This proposal describes the process by which the Teen-LABS study was initiated, the consortium's progress to date, and provides our goals for the next five years of study."
"9306174","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): In the mammalian testis, spermatogenesis takes place in the epithelium of the seminiferous tubule, the functional unit that produces millions of spermatozoa daily. The blood-testis barrier (BTB), located near the basement membrane (BM) of the seminiferous epithelium, confers gate-keeper and the fence function, which restricts the paracellular and transcellular transport of harmful substances such as toxicants across the barrier, respectively, to maintain spermatogenesis. The BTB also physically divides the seminiferous epithelium into a basal and an adluminal compartment; thus, meiosis I and II, and post-meiotic spermatid development take place in a specialized microenvironment (i.e., the adluminal compartment) behind the BTB. The BTB is one of the tightest blood-tissue barriers in mammals since cell junctions at the BTB are reinforced by bundles of actin filaments that lie perpendicular to apposing Sertoli cell plasma membranes, which are only found in the testis. However, the BTB is a dynamic structure, undergoing extensive restructuring at stage VIII of the epithelial cycle so that preleptotene spermatocytes can cross the BTB and enter the adluminal compartment for further development. It is now well established that a functional BTB is crucial for spermatogenesis. Studies completed in the past grant period have shown that BTB function is regulated by biologically active peptides released (i) at the apical ectoplasmic specialization (apical ES, a testis-specific adherens junction at the Sertoli-spermatid interface), and (ii) at th basement membrane (BM) mediated by a functional axis designated the apical ES-BTB-BM axis. In short, biologically active fragments of laminin and collagen chains released at the apical ES and the BM, respectively, act as autocrine factors to regulate BTB function in this axis. Herein, we will continue this important research to understand the underlying molecular mechanism(s) that regulates BTB function. First, we will unravel the mechanism(s) by which these fragments regulate Sertoli cell adhesion and BTB restructuring via their effects on the F-actin network at the BTB, such as actin binding and regulatory proteins. We will also examine the involvement of endosome-mediated protein trafficking and small regulatory RNAs in these events using state-of-the-art techniques and approaches. Second, we will identify the biological significance of biomolecules, such as cytokines, steroids and matrix metalloproteases, in regulating the stage-specific production of these bioactive peptides during the epithelial cycle of spermatogenesis. These findings will have a significant impact in understanding the biology of BTB in spermatogenesis. More important, these findings will shed new light on the development of novel reversible non-hormonal contraceptives for men. For instance, peptides derived from the apical ES and BM can be developed into contraceptives to perturb BTB function and impair spermatogenesis. Additionally, these findings can lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches to interfere with toxicant-induced male reproductive dysfunction, which is one of the leading causes of the decline in male fertility. For instance, the environmental toxicant cadmium mediates its effects at the BTB to induce male reproductive dysfunction; these findings provide crucial information in the design and synthesis of small molecules that either reverse or block cadmium-induced BTB disruption that leads to male infertility."
"9317525","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): This project is designed to deliver an anti-mucus drug for the treatment of respiratory airway disease. Airway diseases such as COPD and asthma are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the U.S. and worldwide and serious forms of these diseases are linked to excess production of inflammatory mucus that obstructs the airway. However, there are no specific and effective therapies to attenuate airway mucus production. The cytokine IL-13 is implicated as a potent stimulus of airway mucus production in both asthma and COPD, and there are ongoing clinical trials of anti-IL-13 biologics. We reasoned that a small molecule to attenuate IL-13- stimulated (but not baseline) mucus production would address a major need for therapy of airway disease. Moreover, a drug targeted to airway epithelial cells themselves could offer significant advantages of specificity and efficacy. We discovered a novel pathway for mucus production that includes IL-13-induction of chloride channel calcium activated 1 (CLCA1) and then activation of mitogen activated protein kinase 13 (MAPK13). This CLCA1-MAPK13 signaling pathway was defined in experimental models but is also active in patients with excess mucus production due to COPD and likely asthma as well. Structure-based drug design led to the development of the first potent MAPK13 inhibitors, which safely attenuated IL-13-stimulated (but not baseline) mucus production in human airway epithelial cells and now appear effective in vitro and in vivo in a pig model of inflammatory airway mucus production. This Project therefore aims to deliver a safe and effective MAPK13 inhibitor for the treatment of excess mucus production found in COPD and related hypersecretory conditions. The UH2 Phase will accomplish two aims. Aim 1 will optimize lead MAPK13 inhibitors to attenuate IL-13- stimulated mucus production in human airway epithelial cells and will secure standardized in vitro ADMET evidence required for selection of a preclinical development candidate. Aim 2 will finalize conditions for IL-13- dependent airway mucus production in a large animal model that is suitable for testing anti-mucus drugs in vitro and in vivo. The UH3 Phase will advance three Aims. Aim 1 will formulate oral and inhaled candidate compounds and complete standardized in vivo ADMET-PK/PD studies. Aim 2 will proceed to safety and efficacy of candidate drugs in a large animal model of mucus production. Aim 3 will develop a protocol for use of candidate drug in humans, including safety, regulatory, and scale-up requirements for IND status. Each Aim has a defined timeline and benchmark. Together, we expect to arrive at a clinical candidate for a MAPK13 inhibitor as the first small-molecule therapeutic to control excess inflammatory mucus production. The projected market for our anti-mucus drug is hypersecretory conditions such as COPD and asthma. The Project will operate under a business plan that includes a patent filed by Washington University for proprietary anti-mucus compounds and eventual clinical trials in humans to achieve FDA approval of a MAPK13 inhibitor as an anti-mucus drug.

"9357646","Project 1 Project Summary  Osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is one of the most common skeletal dysplasias. Most cases are caused by either qualitative or quantitative defects in type I collagen. We previously identified the pathogenic mechanism of recessively inherited OI caused by CRTAP and P3H1 mutations, components of a collagen prolyl 3-hydroxylation complex. We also identified mutations in the signaling molecules PEDF, IFITM5, and WNT1 causing recessive OI. Importantly, our WNT1 finding identified the first specific WNT ligand involved in a human skeletal dysplasia. Surprisingly, WNT1 is best known for its functions in neural crest and cerebellar development, while its essential function in bone was a surprise. Hence, there are many unanswered questions regarding WNT1-related OI: 1) What are the tissue-specific requirements of WNT1 in bone? 2) Which signaling pathways mediate WNT1 function in bone? 3) Can therapeutics that target Wnt signaling show differential efficacy in distinct OI types? 4) What other Wnt-signaling pathway genes contribute to OI and/or low bone mass? The goals of Project 1 are to understand the functions of WNT1 in bone development and homeostasis; to identify the pathogenic mechanisms by which mutations in WNT1 lead to OI; to test the potential of anti-sclerostin antibody treatment for WNT1-related vs. other types of OI; and to identify novel genes in the WNT and collagen modification pathway leading to OI. Our preliminary data show that Wnt1 mutant mice (swaying) exhibit spontaneous fractures and reduced bone mass. Moreover, overexpression of Wnt1 increases osteoblast differentiation and activates mTORC1 signaling in vitro. We hypothesize that Wnt1 expressed in osteocytes contributes to bone homeostasis by regulating mTORC1 signaling in osteoblasts. We will test this hypothesis by accomplishing the following specific aims: Aim 1. What are the tissue and cell- specific contributions of Wnt1 to skeletal development and homeostasis? Aim 2. What are the downstream signaling pathways that mediate Wnt1 functions in skeletal development and homeostasis? Aim 3. What are the effects of Wnt-targeted therapies in different forms of OI? Aim 4. Are there rare forms of OI that identify new and essential components of collagen processing and/or Wnt signaling in bone?"

"9359434","PROJECT II ? PROJECT SUMMARY/ABSTRACT Ischemia-reperfusion injury (lRI) may lead to poor early graft function, primary non-function and predisposes the graft to acute and/or chronic rejection. The pathophysiology of liver IRI has been investigated in animal models, primarily in the setting of hepatic partial warm ischemia in situ, and cold storage/syngeneic Tx, with mechanistic emphasis on innate immune responses. Clearly, there are major discrepancies between these experimental models and the clinical scenario, which may cause deficiencies in our comprehension of the disease mechanism. In this regard, the question of whether and how allo-antigens (Ag)/adaptive allo-immunity impact tissue inflammatory response and injury against IR is of high significance. We have compared liver IRI between syngeneic and allogeneic transplants in both rat and mouse orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) models. Results showed unequivocally that allografts developed significantly more severe tissue injuries than isografts under the same preservation condition in the early stage of reperfusion, which were distinctive kinetically from rejection. Lymphocytes and their functional mechanisms involved in the liver IRI of allografts are clearly different from those in isografts. This project focuses on the role of CD4 T cells in liver IRI of allo-, vs. iso-OLTs after extended cold storage. We have found in a liver partial warm ischemia model that the effector memory (TEM) subset (CD44highCD62Llow), but not naïve, CD4 T cells were able to function in Ag non- specific manner via a CD154 dependent, but IFN-? independent mechanism. In the OLT setting, our recent data specified functions of IFN-? in liver IRI of allo-, but not iso-grafts. We hypothesize that recipient pre- existing CD4 TEM cells are responding to liver IR immediately post Tx. They function via both Ag-specific and non-specific pathways involving distinctive effector mechanisms. We have documented that liver CD4 TEM expressed CD154 constitutively and enhanced innate inflammatory immune activation via CD40, independent of their Ag-specificities. In allo-OLTs, we propose that donor allo-Ags may, additionally, activate recipient infiltrating alloreactive CD4 TEM cells to produce IFN-?, which is responsible for the enhanced inflammatory immune activation and hepatocellular damage, as compared with those in iso-OLTs. Thus, CD4 TEM cells may promote liver IRI by Ag-specific reactivation to secrete IFN-? and Ag non-specific interaction via CD154 with CD40 on innate immune cells. We will address our hypothesis in two specific aims to determine Ag- specificities and effector mechanisms of CD4 T cells in IRI of OLTs. These studies will be the first to specifically address the fundamental immunobiology question of liver IRI in allogeneic vs. syngeneic transplantation. Results will not only fulfill the gap in our understanding of the disease pathogenesis in real clinical setting, but also provide us novel insight into the role of adaptive immunity in regulating tissue innate inflammatory immune responses."
"9495773","PROJECT SUMMARY  Many African-Americans and Latinos with diabetes do not achieve recommended diabetes goals placing them at high risk for complications. Team-based models of care can help in reaching goals of therapy. Additionally, mobile health (mHealth) technologies can further improve outcomes among those more difficult to reach. This study will evaluate the impact of a team-based, mHealth intervention designed to improve medication adherence, healthy eating, and physical activity behaviors. We will compare this mHealth approach with usual care.  Clinical pharmacists and health coaches (HC) will deliver our proposed team-based intervention. mHealth delivery includes mobile phone text messaging, secure videoconferencing, and HC home visits. Pharmacists will focus on medication reconciliation and adherence. Health coaches will help identify psychosocial and environmental challenges to adherence in a culturally-sensitive manner. Together, they can assist in goal-setting, problem-solving, negotiation of competing priorities, and provide social support leveraging mHealth technologies.  Preliminary data from our research group supports the role of health coaches partnering with clinic- based pharmacists in improving diabetes outcomes in minorities. In the proposed mHealth intervention, patient- pharmacist videoconferencing will eliminate the need for in-person visits with a pharmacist, which is impractical for many low-income patients. In addition, our pilot work suggests that text messaging is a preferable means of communication and may facilitate more frequent contact with patients.  We propose a randomized, controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches. We will randomize 220 patients through UI Health to either: (1) mHealth diabetes adherence support through clinical pharmacists and health coaches; or (2) usual care. After one year, patients completing the mHealth intervention will be monitored for an additional year while the usual care group receives the mHealth approach. Outcomes include medication adherence, hemoglobin A1c, blood pressure, and LDL-cholesterol levels. The specific aims include: (1) evaluate the effectiveness of an mHealth diabetes adherence support intervention delivered by clinical pharmacists and health coaches to African-American and Latino adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes; (2) evaluate the maintenance of improved diabetes behaviors as well as clinical outcomes one year after completing the intervention; (3) evaluate the cost and cost-effectiveness of mHealth diabetes adherence support compared to usual care; and (4) evaluate the reach, adoption, and implementation of mHealth diabetes adherence support based on the RE-AIM framework."
"9344680","PROJECT SUMMARY Accumulating evidence from clinical trials suggests that a restrictive transfusion strategy is safe in most clinical settings. However, a low oxygen carrying capacity from moderate anemia may be deleterious in patients with cardiac ischemia. The potential for harm associated with anemia in patients with acute symptomatic coronary disease is supported by pathophysiological data that maintaining higher hemoglobin levels could benefit the ischemic heart by increasing oxygen delivery. Furthermore, results of the 110 patient MINT pilot trial found that all-cause mortality at 30 days was less frequent with a liberal transfusion strategy, 1 patient (1.8%), compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy, 7 patients (13.0%), (p=0.032). Systematic reviews of clinical trials evaluating transfusion strategies in patients with known ischemic heart disease document the absence of high quality data which has resulted in an ongoing controversy. The lack of high quality evidence to guide transfusions in patients with acute myocardial infarction has been cited in several major guidelines as well as by an NIH expert panel. Despite this, blood transfusions are being used as a negative indicator of quality of care by major organizations driving the adoption of restrictive strategies. The potential for adverse outcomes is real and immediate. In this multicenter pragmatic trial, we will activate 40 clinical centers and will randomly allocate 3500 patients at risk of myocardial ischemia with acute myocardial infarction and hemoglobin concentration less than 10 g/dL to be treated either according to a restrictive or liberal blood transfusion strategy. Our Primary Aim will be to determine whether a liberal transfusion threshold strategy (10 g/dL) is superior and will result in lower rates of either all cause mortality or acute myocardial infarction within 30 days following randomization as compared with a restrictive transfusion threshold strategy (8 g/dL). Our secondary aims will examine the effect of a liberal transfusion strategy compared with a restrictive transfusion strategy on adverse outcomes of transfusion related to volume overload, thrombotic risk and modified immunity. We will compare 30-day rates of congestive heart failure, thromboembolism, and pneumonia. We will also compare rates of 30-day death, cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, and unscheduled revascularization, as well as hospital length of stay, and readmission to the hospital. We will contact the patients at 6 months to determine if the early effects on mortality are sustained or possibly enhanced. Relevance MINT is positioned to determine the threshold for blood transfusions in patients with acute myocardial infarction to minimize death and subsequent heart attacks. Given the high incidence of acute myocardial infarction, the results of MINT can shape clinical practice."
"9319338","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Mutations and activation of glucocerebrosidase (GBA) play a prominent role in the pathogenesis of the alpha- synucleinopathies, PD and LBD. GBA plays a pivotal role in the lysosomal degradation pathway by functioning as a lysosomal enzyme. Most disease causing mutations of GBA are thought to be loss of function mutations that ultimately lead to the GBA deficiency, compromised glucosylceremide (GlcCer) metabolism and the subsequent failure of lysosomal mediated degradation of GBA substrates including alpha-synuclein. Depletion of GBA results in ?-synuclein accumulation and neurodegeneration suggesting compromised GBA cascade contributes to the pathogenesis of ?-synucleinopathies. We and others have found that brains of PD patients with or without mutations in GBA, as well as brains of A53T alpha-synuclein transgenic (Tg) mice, exhibit reduced GBA activity suggesting a role of the enzyme in the pathogenesis of the disease. Interestingly, the loss of catalytic activity of GBA correlated with its quantitative protein reduction, suggesting that unidentified key modulators might play an important role in GBA protein levels and activity though posttranslational modifications (PTMs). Accordingly, we investigated the mechanisms underlying the loss of GBA activity and protein levels by identifying key GBA modulators using tandem affinity purification (TAP) analysis. In preliminary data, we discovered GIP1 (GBA interacting protein 1) and show that GIP1 belongs to a new class of E3 ligases. In this project, we propose to explore the regulation of the GBA by GIP1 and their roles in regulating the pathogenesis of ?-synuclein in PD and LBD. In specific aim 1 we will determine whether GIP1 interacts with and ubiquitinates GBA in vitro and in vivo. In specific aim 2 we will examine whether GIP1 targets GBA for degradation, thus regulating GBA activity and its substrates, GlcCer. Since GBA is a lysosomal enzyme that potentially regulates the expression of alpha synuclein, we will also explore whether GIP1 mediated GBA degradation ultimately regulates alpha-synuclein expression and aggregation. To accomplish these specific aims we will utilize lenti-GIP1 shRNA virus to knockdown GIP1 and a herpes simplex-GIP1 virus to overexpress GIP1. In preliminary studies we discovered that GIP1 accumulates in A53T alpha-synuclein Tg mice, PD brains and neurons treated with alpha-synuclein preformed fibrils (PFFs). Thus, in specific aim 3 we will further evaluate whether alpha-synuclein pathology is associated with accumulation of GIP1 and if its accumulation correlates with GBA deficiency and the severity of the alpha-synuclein pathology in A53T alpha-synuclein Tg mice and PD patients, as well as ?-synuclein PFFs treated neurons. Moreover, preliminary data indicates that depletion of GIP1 significant reduces alpha-synuclein PFFs induced neuronal death. Thus, in specific aim 3, we will also evaluate the role of GIP1 in alpha-synuclein PFFs induced neuronal death. Ultimately this project will determine the full implications of the GIP1-GBA-alpha-synulcein neurodegenerative pathway and will identify new targets for therapeutic intervention in PD and LBD."

"9316427","The External Support and Dissemination Core will develop new visualization tools for aging-relevant studies,  and will enable better access to health data by linking visualizations to underlying data points and resources.  Data visualizations are an integral part of IHME's mission to provide high-quality health data that is freely  accessible. The GBD Study has been the fulcrum to recently expand the data visualization resources  available at IHME: in addition to a suite of new visualizations, the GBD has helped to establish online  tutorials on the use of visualizations, expand internal web development resources to create and support  visualizations, and has established short courses for students on the creation of visualizations. This core will  leverage these existing GBD resources to expand the number and type of new visualization tools that are  specifically focused on healthy aging and longevity. In addition, the databases and visualizations will be  expanded to include data on policy interventions and social determinants. Key areas for visualization  development include the relationship between health expenditures and health outcome for each disease and  injury category; impact of policy variables on health outcomes over time; and the social factors related to  healthy life expectancy. In addition, this core will increase the transparency and constructive use of the GBD  results by linking visualizations with the intermediate transformed data points and with original data sources  through citations. This will enable users to explore the GBD results and drill down to the underlying data  sources to support additional in-depth subnational and international comparative analyses and cross-comparisons  between data sources. It is expected that these tools will launch new collaborations, support  the career development of new investigators, and spark new research into the social, policy-related,  economic and behavioral determinants of health outcomes and the relationships between expenditures and  disease burdens, including those at the subnational and international levels."
"9269219","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): The University of Chicago Growth, Development and Disabilities MD/PhD Training Program is designed to provide basic science and translational research training for a highly selective group of medical students in a combined-degree program. The Program is based on the premise that a commitment to complete both the MD and PhD degrees and to establish and maintain a research-focused career is only developed after some time in medical school (hence no attrition from this training program since 1978). Students are chosen on the basis of outstanding academic credentials, demonstrated ability in basic science, and devotion to pursuit of a research-oriented career. All students fulfill the requirements of a PhD in a particular discipline and complete the same requirements for the MD as other medical students. They are continuously and longitudinally advised by the Program Director and staff, a Student Advisory Committee, a newly-formed External Advisory Committee, and Mentors who have outstanding records of promoting the training, education and career advancement of biomedical scientists. The Program has undergone a restructuring to more closely align its training goals with the mission of NICHD to foster training in the areas of growt, development, and disabilities research and clinical specialties in pediatrics and related areas. The overall Program, its elements, and the participants are assessed via multiple evaluation tools through the year. The ultimate success is measured by the impact of the trainees' thesis research, the completion of both the MD and PhD degrees, and their long- term success as physician-scientists."
"9480911","DESCRIPTION (provided by applicant): Lethal bone metastasis frequently develops in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Critically, the biology of this conditio remains uncertain. Our currently funded Program Project Grant (PPG) focuses on characterizing selected soluble factors, heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPG) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) secreted by cancer cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment, to develop biomarkers to predict PC progression and treatment response. Our progress during the current funding period includes several patents and the development of multiple antibodies recognizing HSPG fragments for potential commercialization as diagnostic/ prognostic biomarkers. We also humanized a therapeutic antibody against ?2-microglobulin for clinical translation to treat PC bone metastasis. In this competitive renewal application, our long-term redefined goal is to pursue new concepts in the tumor microenvironment that redirect tumor cells toward a metastatic phenotype. These innovations include the discoveries that (1) metastasis can be coordinated by Metastasis Initiating Cells (MICs) (Project 1: Chung), (2) the HSPG perlecan and its degradative products are critical mediators of PC metastasis (Project 2: Farach-Carson); (3) cells with megakaryocyte and/or osteomimetic (MO-mimicry) properties reside in primary tumors and can be altered by stromal factors to metastasize to bone (Project 3: Bhowmick); and (4) epigenetic programming of the PC genome can affect cholesterol and sterol metabolism in a manner that promotes metastasis (Project 4: Freeman). To test these concepts, we will use approaches and resources unique to our team. We showed that MICs can reprogram non-metastatic dormant cells through a feed-forward action involving a RANK-mediated signaling network, provoking them to participate in bone colonization. This novel concept is supported by substantial data from animal models and a unique population of hormone-naïve PC patients with bone metastasis and pathologic specimens collected from patients with known overall survival. We will pursue the underlying biology of how circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) (Project 1- Chung), and endothelial and inflammatory cells (Project 2), are recruited to participate in the metastatic cascade. We propose to develop biomarkers to predict which patients will switch from indolent to aggressive disease. Our long range objectives will be achieved by identifying signaling pathways converging on critical nodes that can be targeted with drugs. Our team has developed a range of state-of-the-art methods and tools, including single cell methods of tumor cell isolation using NanoVelcro microfluidics, whole genome sequencing, quantitative IHC by multiplex quantum dot labeling (mQDL), ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses. We have demonstrated success in 3D culture of human DTCs, tissue recombinants comprised of engineered human and murine cells, and reliable models of human PC bone and soft tissue metastases."
"9420094","Contact PD/PI: Sherwin, Robert S. 1. Overall Project Summary- The Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) was created in 2005 to strengthen Yale's infrastructure for clinical and translational research, based on the recommendation of a Medical School strategic planning committee. Soon afterwards, when NIH launched its new program of Clinical & Translational Science Awards, YCCI applied and became the home of the Yale CTSA. Since then, one of its major priorities has been to support the education and career development of the next generation of clinical and translational investigators. As described in the present application, this initiative has met with great success, underscored by the fact that graduates of YCCI's K-Scholar program have received 47 individual NIH K Awards, 43 NIH RO1 awards, and 65 Foundation grants, published >1,800 papers, and obtained >$240 million in independent research funding. Remarkably, 98% of the program's graduates have stayed in academic medicine or pursued research careers in the biotech or pharmaceutical industries. YCCI has also made substantial progress in its push to accelerate the translation of disease-related discoveries into the clinic. As will be described, it provides Yale investigators with key assistance in areas including biostatistics and bioinformatics, study design, protocol development, regulatory approval, patient recruitment, access to inpatient and outpatient research facilities, and budgeting support, and gives them ready access to pilot grants and state-of-the-art research cores. The result has been a significant upsurge in the number and scope of clinical research projects throughout the Medical Center. In the next grant cycle, YCCI will build upon these achievements with an emphasis on team-based T1 to T4 research, including studies across the lifespan. YCCI will also pursue new partnerships with the Yale School of Engineering & Applied Science to develop an innovative technology transfer program called the Center for Biological and Innovative Technology (CBIT) and with the School of Organization & Management to offer a novel program of leadership training for clinicians and physician-scientists. In addition, YCCI will take active advantage of the recent expansion of clinical services by Yale-New Haven Hospital (YNHH), which now has 1,540 beds and more than 1 million outpatients visits per year, and the growth of the Yale Medical Group (YMG), which has a network of >1,200 practicing physicians in >100 clinical specialties. The resulting clinical volume (~4 million patient records) gives Yale researchers access to a large, diverse patient base for outcomes studies and clinical trials. Overall, YCCI will leverage Yale's outstanding scientific and clinical environment and work with other CTSA hubs to foster the growth of multidisciplinary team science, to develop innovative strategies for disease prevention, diagnostics, and therapeutics, and to implement results for the benefit of the health care system and the population as a whole.
